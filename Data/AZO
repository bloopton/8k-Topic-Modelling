AUTOZONE AUTHORIZES ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES
Reiterates Commitment to Corporate Governance
AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $300 million of the company's common stock, of which $200 million will be authorized for repurchase under a plan qualifying under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plan under Rule 10b5-1 would allow the Company to repurchase shares at times when it would ordinarily not be in the market because of self-imposed blackout periods.  The company has nearly completed the repurchase of the $300 million in common stock authorized in March 2002.
Memphis, Tenn. (July 16, 2002) --
"AutoZone has had strong cash flow throughout the year and strengthening debt coverage ratios," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  For the trailing twelve months ended May 4, 2002, EBITDA to interest coverage improved to 9.6 times from 6.5 times for the twelve months ended May 5, 2001.  For the same periods, debt was reduced to 1.55 times EBITDA from 2.14 times in the corresponding prior year period. "The stock repurchases have greatly added to shareholder value and we intend to continue repurchasing stock so long as the repurchases are accretive to earnings, while maintaining investment grade credit ratings," Odland said.
"We also want to express our support for efforts to improve corporate governance to restore the public's confidence in corporate financials," he said.  In June 2001, AutoZone's Board of Directors adopted Corporate Governance Principles that are similar to those now being proposed by the NYSE.  A copy of those principles accompanies this press release.
"Further, last December we engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide additional internal audit services to assure the strength of our internal controls and to supplement the annual audit performed by our independent auditing firm of Ernst & Young LLP.
"Historically, AutoZone has been conservative in the use of stock options," Odland said.  In the past couple of years, AutoZone's stock option grants each year have ranged from 1.0% to 1.4% of total shares outstanding.  AutoZone's accounting for stock option grants is disclosed in the 2001 Annual Report and follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123.  Had AutoZone expensed stock option grants in fiscal year 2001, earnings per share would have been reduced by only $0.06.  AutoZone's employee stock option plans have been approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders.  "We want to be as progressive and transparent as possible so investors have a clear picture of the company's financials.  AutoZone anticipates changing its methodology for the accounting for stock options; however, rather than making a change now and another subsequent change, we will await final rule changes and modify our accounting at that time."
On September 24, 2002, AutoZone will announce results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended August 31, 2002.  The earnings announcement will be one week later than normal as AutoZone's current fiscal year has 53 weeks.  AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call on September 25, 2002, beginning at 9 a.m. (CDT).
AutoZone sells auto and light truck parts, chemicals and accessories through 3,052 AutoZone stores in 44 states plus the District of Columbia in the U.S. and 27 AutoZone stores in Mexico and also sells the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the Web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information through alldatadiy.com, and auto and light truck parts through AutoZone.com.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. These statements discuss, among other things, anticipated stock repurchases and future performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, the price of AutoZone's common stock, AutoZone's credit rating, competition, product demand, the economy, inflation, gasoline prices, the ability to hire and retain qualified employees, consumer debt levels, war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity, and availability of commercial transportation. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of AutoZone's amended Form S-3 dated April 25, 2002, for more information related to those risks. AutoZone undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

AUTOZONE, INC.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
ADOPTION
        The Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., has adopted these Corporate Governance Principles on June 5, 2001.  
BOARD MISSION & OBJECTIVES
        Mission Statement
        AutoZone's primary objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value, while adhering to the laws of the jurisdictions wherein it operates and at all times observing the highest ethical standards.
        Corporate Authority & Responsibility
        All corporate authority resides in the Board of Directors as the representative of the stockholders. Authority is delegated to management by the Board in order to implement AutoZone's mission. Such delegated authority includes the authorization of spending limits and the authority to hire employees and terminate their services. The Board retains responsibility to recommend candidates to the stockholders for election to the Board of Directors. The Board retains responsibility for selection and evaluation of the CEO, oversight of the succession plan, determination of senior management compensation, approval of the annual budget, assurance of adequate systems, procedures and controls, as well as assisting in the preparation and approval of the strategic plan. Additionally, the Board provides advice and counsel to senior management. The Board may exercise its authority through committees of the Board  
DIRECTORS
        Personal Characteristics & Core Competencies of Directors:
        Individual Directors should possess all of the following personal characteristics:
- Character is the primary consideration in evaluating any Director. Directors should demonstrate high ethical standards and integrity in their personal and professional dealings and be willing to act on and remain accountable for their Boardroom decisions.
Integrity and Accountability
- Directors should have the ability to provide wise, thoughtful counsel on a broad range of issues. Directors should possess high intelligence and wisdom and apply it in decision making.
Informed Judgment
- One of the important roles of the Board is to monitor AutoZone's financial performance. Directors should be financially literate. Directors should know how to read a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and understand the use of financial ratios and other indices for evaluating company performance.
Financial Literacy
- The Board functions best when Directors value Board and team performance over individual performance. Openness to other opinions and the willingness to listen should rank as highly as the ability to communicate persuasively. Directors should approach others assertively, responsibly and supportively and identify issues in a manner that encourages open discussion.
Mature Confidence
- In today's highly competitive world, only companies capable of performing at the highest levels are likely to prosper. Directors should have a history of achievements that reflect high standards for themselves and others.
High Performance Standards
- Directors should be passionate about the performance of AutoZone, both in absolute terms and relative to its peers. That passion should manifest itself in engaged debate about the future of AutoZone and an esprit de corps among the Board that both challenges and inspires AutoZoners.
Passion
 
        Core Competencies of the Board as a Whole
        To adequately fulfill the Board's complex roles, from overseeing the audit and monitoring managerial performance to responding to crises and approving AutoZone's strategic plan, a host of core competencies need to be represented on the Board. The Board as a whole should possess the following core competencies, with each member contributing knowledge, experience and skills in one or more domains:
- Among the most important missions of the Board is ensuring that stockholder value is both enhanced through corporate performance and protected through adequate internal financial controls. The Board should have one or more Directors with specific expertise in financial accounting and corporate finance, especially with respect to trends in debt and equity markets.
Accounting and Finance
- Stockholders rely on Directors to make sensible choices on their behalf. The majority of Directors should have a record of making good business decisions in the corporate sector.
Business Judgment
- To monitor corporate management, the Board needs to understand management trends in general and industry trends in particular. The Board should have one or more Directors who understand and stay current on general management "best practices" and their application in complex, rapidly evolving business environments.
Management
- Organizations inevitably experience both short and long-term crises. The ability to deal with crises can minimize ramifications and limit negative impact on firm performance. Boards should have one or more Directors who have the ability and time to perform during periods of both short-term and prolonged crises.
Crisis Response
- Companies continually face new opportunities and threats that are unique to their industries. The Board should have one or more members with appropriate and relevant industry-specific knowledge.
Industry Knowledge
- To succeed in an increasingly global economy, the Board should have one or more Directors who appreciate the importance of global business trends and who have first-hand knowledge of international business experience in those markets.
International Markets
- A key Board role is to approve and monitor company strategy to ensure AutoZone's continued high performance. The Board should have one or more Directors with the skills and capacity to provide strategic insight and direction by encouraging innovation, conceptualizing key trends, evaluating strategic decisions, and continuously challenging the organization to sharpen its vision.
Strategy & Vision
        Changes in Professional Responsibility
        The Board should consider whether a change in an individual's professional responsibilities directly or indirectly impacts that person's ability to fulfill directorship obligations. All Directors should submit a resignation as a matter of course upon retirement, a change in employer, or other significant change in their professional roles and responsibilities. If the Board believes that a director will continue to make a contribution to the organization, the continued membership of that director may be supported.
        Identification and Recruitment of Directors
        One of the tasks of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to identify and recruit candidates to serve on the Board of Directors. A list of candidates shall be presented to the Board for nomination and to the stockholders for consideration. The committee may, at its discretion, seek third-party resources to assist in the process. The CEO will be included in the process on a non-voting basis. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make the final recommendation to the Board.  
        Independent Directors
        A substantial majority of the Board of Directors should be independent. An independent director is defined as a director who:
has not been employed by AutoZone in an executive capacity within the last three years;
is not, and is not affiliated with a company that is, an adviser, or consultant to AutoZone or a member of AutoZone's senior management;
is not affiliated with a significant customer or supplier of AutoZone;
has no personal services contract with AutoZone or with any member of AutoZone's senior management;
is not affiliated with a not-for-profit entity that receives significant contributions from AutoZone;
within the last three years, has not had any business relationship with AutoZone (other than service as a director) for which AutoZone has been or will be required to make disclosure under Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission as currently in effect;
is not employed by a public company at which an executive officer of AutoZone serves as a director;
has not had any of the relationships described above with any affiliate of AutoZone; and
is not a member of the immediate family of any person with any relationships described above.
        Outside Directorships
        The members of the Board acknowledge that significant time is required to be a fully participating and effective member of AutoZone's Board of Directors. Therefore, each independent director should not hold more than two or three directorships of public companies other than AutoZone. The CEO should not be a member on more than one or two Boards of other public companies, and AutoZone's other executive officers should not be members of more than one other Board of a public company. A Director should notify the Secretary prior to accepting a new position on another Board in order that the Secretary may examine the relationship for a potential conflict of interest.
        Compensation of Directors
        Outside Directors are compensated in accordance with the Director Compensation Plan and the Director Stock Option Plan as may be in effect from time to time. The Board believes that a significant portion of a director's compensation should be in common stock to further the direct correlation of directors' and stockholders' interests.
        The Compensation Committee shall review independent director compensation from time to time and recommend to the full Board any changes in compensation as the committee may deem necessary.
        Directors that are officers or employees shall not receive any additional compensation for their service as Directors. Outside Directors shall not receive a pension solely as a result of service as a Director.  
        Direct Investment in AutoZone Stock by Directors
        Since a significant ownership stake leads to a stronger alignment of interests between directors and stockholders, each director is required to personally invest at least $100,000 in company stock within three years of joining the board. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by the board under compelling mitigating circumstances.  
        Service Limitations of Directors
        A Director may not stand for reelection after age 70, but need not resign until the end of his or her term. The Board may, however, upon evaluation of a Director that has reached 70 years of age, in its discretion ask such Director to remain on the Board in extraordinary circumstances if the Board believes that such Director will continue to make significant contributions to the work of the Board.
        No director shall be eligible to be reelected to the Board of Directors after serving on the Board for 15 years. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Directors serving on the Board as of the first date of the adoption of these Corporate Governance Principles shall be eligible to be reelected as a Director until the first annual meeting of stockholders held after the passage of 15 years from the date of first adoption of these Corporate Governance Principles.
        In order to retain freshness in the process and to give new management the unfettered ability to provide new leadership, a retiring CEO shall not continue to serve on the Board except in extraordinary circumstances.  
        Conflict of Interest
        From time to time, an issue being considered by the Board may present, or may give the appearance of presenting, a conflict of interest for a Director. Each Director should take appropriate steps to assure that in each matter considered that the Director is disinterested with respect to that matter, other than the interests of AutoZone and its stockholders. Any Director faced with any potential conflict should disclose any such potential conflict to the Secretary and the Chairman and should not participate in discussions or votes on such issue unless a majority of the Board determines, after consultation with counsel, that no conflict of interest exists as to such matter.
        Directors that are not independent Directors shall not participate in the Board's decision of selection, removal, or performance assessment of the CEO.  
BOARD ORGANIZATION
        Board Size
        In general, smaller boards are more cohesive, work better together and tend to be more effective monitors than larger boards. Ideally, the Board should be comprised of six to ten outside Directors and one to two Directors who also are employees or officers.  
        Committees
        All major decisions will be considered by the Board as a whole. As a consequence, the committee structure of the Board is limited to those committees considered to be basic to or required for the operation of AutoZone as a publicly-owned entity. Standing committees shall include audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance. The audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees shall be composed solely of independent Directors. The Board may form other committees as it determines appropriate. Each committee shall operate in accordance with its charter as adopted by the Board. Committee members and chairs shall be appointed annually by the Board in accordance with the charter of each committee.  
BOARD OPERATIONS
        Meetings
        The agenda for each Board meeting shall be determined by the Chairman. Each Director is encouraged to suggest agenda items.
        The Board shall meet at least four times per fiscal year in accordance with a meeting schedule that is approved by the Board. The Board may also meet at such other times in meetings which may be called in accordance with AutoZone's Bylaws.
        Other members of management may attend non-executive meetings of the Board at the invitation of the Chairman.  
        Communications
        Directors have full access to the Chairman and CEO and senior officers reporting directly to the CEO and to information about the corporation's operations. Directors should refrain from giving strategic or operating direction to members of management outside the scope of full Board or committee responsibility and accountability.  
        Board Ability to Retain Advisors
        The Board shall retain advisors as it believes to be appropriate. If management is retaining advisors to the Board, such decision must be ratified by the Board..  
       
Material in Advance of Meetings
        The Board must be given sufficient information to fully exercise its governance functions. This information comes from a variety of sources, including management reports, a comparison of performance to plans, security analysts' reports, articles in various business publications, etc. Generally, Board members will receive information prior to Board meetings so they will have an opportunity to reflect properly on the items to be considered at the meeting.
        The Board will ensure that adequate time is provided for full discussion of important items and that management presentations are scheduled in a manner that permits a substantial proportion of Board meeting time to be available for open discussion.  
        Executive Session
        The independent Directors should meet privately in executive session from time to time to review the performance of the CEO and other executive officers. The independent Directors should meet in executive session at the end of each Board meeting to consider other issues that they may determine from time to time, without the presence of any member of management.  
        Evaluation of the CEO
        The selection and evaluation of the chief executive officer and concurrence with the CEO's selection and evaluation of the corporation's top management team are the most important function of the Board. In its broader sense, "selection and evaluation" includes considering compensation, planning for succession and, when appropriate, replacing the CEO or other members of the top management team. The performance of the CEO will be reviewed at least annually solely by the outside Directors without the presence of the CEO or other inside Directors. The evaluation of the CEO shall be led by the chair of the compensation committee. The Board should have an understanding with the CEO with respect to criteria on which he or she will be evaluated, and the results of the evaluation will be communicated to the CEO.  
        Succession and Management Development
        The CEO will report annually to the Board on AutoZone's program for succession and management development.
        CEO succession is a Board-driven, collaborative process. Although the current CEO has an important role to play, the Board must own the plan for succession while collaborating with the CEO in deciding the timing and the necessary qualifications for making a final decision.  
        Outside Communication
        The Board believes that management speaks for the company. In accordance with this philosophy, Directors should defer to the Chairman or AutoZone's public relations department when requested to make any comments regarding AutoZone or its business.
        Annual Election of Directors
        In order to create greater alignment between the Board's and our stockholders' interests and to promote greater accountability to the stockholders, Directors shall be elected annually.  
PERIODIC REVIEW OF GUIDELINES
        These guidelines shall be reviewed periodically by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and any amendments shall be presented to the Board for adoption.    
Amended:         December 13, 2001

SAME STORE SALES UP 7%;
TOTAL FISCAL 2002 EPS OF $4.00;
ROIC IMPROVES TO 19.8%
Memphis, Tenn. (September 25, 2002) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO), today reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.73, a 62% increase from earnings per share of $1.07 before restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Including the charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, EPS increased 621% from $0.24. Sales for the fourth fiscal quarter (17 weeks) ended August 31, 2002, increased 12% to $1.84 billion from $1.64 billion reported for the year ago quarter (16 weeks). Excluding the fiscal 2001 sales of TruckPro, which was sold in December, total sales increased 16%. Same store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts stores open at least one year, increased 6.6% during the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter, as a percent of sales, increased 1.94 percentage points to 45.7%. Net operating expenses were 28.8% of sales, resulting in a record quarterly operating margin of 16.9%.
For the year (53 weeks), AutoZone reported diluted earnings per share of $4.00, an increase of 68% from $2.38 in fiscal 2001 (52 weeks), excluding the nonrecurring charges in the prior year. Including the charges, reported earnings per share were up 160%. The $4.00 EPS is double the $2.00 per share earned in fiscal 2000. Annual sales rose 10.5% to $5.32 billion from $4.82 billion in the prior year; excluding the sales of TruckPro, total sales increased 13%. Same store sales for the year increased 8.8%. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased by 2.19 percentage points to 44.6%. Net operating expenses declined to 30.1% of sales, resulting in a record annual operating margin of 14.5%. Driven by strong earnings and declining working capital, return on invested capital reached 19.8%, while cash flow before share repurchases was $730 million.
"We are very pleased with our exceptional performance this year," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "It took a concerted effort from all AutoZoners to make this happen. Clearly our focus on reminding consumers to maintain their cars and beginning to capture the $60 billion annual undone maintenance has been successful."
In the fourth quarter, AutoZone opened 30 new auto parts stores in the U.S., replaced 3 and closed 14. For the year, AutoZone opened 102 new auto parts stores in the U.S., replaced 15 and closed 53 for an end-of-year store count of 3,068. In addition, 12 new auto parts stores were opened in Mexico in the fourth quarter, for a total of 18 new stores in Mexico for the year. At year end, AutoZone had a total of 39 stores in Mexico.
During the quarter, AutoZone's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program of $300 million to an aggregate authorization of $2.3 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, aggregate share repurchases were $2.086 billion or 61.9 million shares, including $150 million or 2.2 million shares under forward purchase contracts. For the quarter, AutoZone repurchased 4.3 million shares at a cost of $287 million or $66.13 per share. For the year, AutoZone repurchased 12.6 million shares at a cost of $699 million or $55.51 per share. Subsequent to year end, the company purchased 1.1 million shares in partial settlement of the forward purchase contract outstanding at August 31, 2002, at an average cost of $69.91 per share.
Steve Odland, Chairman and CEO and Michael Archbold, CFO, confirm they will be certifying AutoZone's fiscal 2002 results when AutoZone files its Form 10-K, which is due November 29, 2002.

        The Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., has adopted these Corporate Governance Principles on June 5, 2001.
AUTOZONE, INC.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
ADOPTION
BOARD MISSION & OBJECTIVES
        Mission Statement
        AutoZone's primary objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value, while adhering to the laws of the jurisdictions wherein it operates and at all times observing the highest ethical standards.
        Corporate Authority & Responsibility
        All corporate authority resides in the Board of Directors as the representative of the stockholders. Authority is delegated to management by the Board in order to implement AutoZone's mission. Such delegated authority includes the authorization of spending limits and the authority to hire employees and terminate their services. The Board retains responsibility to recommend candidates to the stockholders for election to the Board of Directors. The Board retains responsibility for selection and evaluation of the CEO, oversight of the succession plan, determination of senior management compensation, approval of the annual budget, assurance of adequate systems, procedures and controls, as well as assisting in the preparation and approval of the strategic plan. Additionally, the Board provides advice and counsel to senior management. The Board may exercise its authority through committees of the Board.
DIRECTORS
        Personal Characteristics & Core Competencies of Directors:
 
        Individual Directors should possess all of the following personal characteristics:
        Core Competencies of the Board as a Whole
 
        To adequately fulfill the Board's complex roles, from monitoring managerial performance to responding to crises and approving AutoZone's strategic plan, a host of core competencies need to be represented on the Board. The Board as a whole should possess the following core competencies, with each member contributing knowledge, experience and skills in one or more domains:
        Changes in Professional Responsibility
        The Board should consider whether a change in an individual's professional responsibilities directly or indirectly impacts that person's ability to fulfill directorship obligations. All Directors should submit a resignation as a matter of course upon retirement, a change in employer, or other significant change in their professional roles and responsibilities. If the Board believes that a director will continue to make a contribution to the organization, the continued membership of that director may be supported.
        Identification and Recruitment of Directors
        One of the tasks of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to identify and recruit candidates to serve on the Board of Directors. A list of candidates shall be presented to the Board for nomination and to the stockholders for consideration. The committee may, at its discretion, seek third-party resources to assist in the process. The CEO will be included in the process on a non-voting basis. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make the final recommendation to the Board.
        Independent Directors
        A substantial majority of the Board of Directors should be independent. An independent director is defined as a director who:
        Outside Directorships
        The members of the Board acknowledge that significant time is required to be a fully participating and effective member of AutoZone's Board of Directors. Therefore, each independent director should not hold more than two or three directorships of public companies other than AutoZone. The CEO should not be a member on more than one or two Boards of other public companies, and AutoZone's other executive officers should not be members of more than one other Board of a public company. A Director should notify the Secretary prior to accepting a new position on another Board in order that the Secretary may examine the relationship for a potential conflict of interest.
        Compensation of Directors
        Outside Directors are compensated in accordance with the Director Compensation Plan and the Director Stock Option Plan as may be in effect from time to time. The Board believes that a significant portion of a director's compensation should be in common stock to further the direct correlation of directors' and stockholders' interests.
        The Compensation Committee shall review independent director compensation from time to time and recommend to the full Board any changes in compensation as the committee may deem necessary.
        Directors that are officers or employees shall not receive any additional compensation for their service as Directors. Outside Directors shall not receive a pension solely as a result of service as a Director.
        Direct Investment in AutoZone Stock by Directors
        Since a significant ownership stake leads to a stronger alignment of interests between directors and stockholders, each director is required to personally invest at least $100,000 in company stock within three years of joining the board. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by the board under compelling mitigating circumstances.
        Service Limitations of Directors
        A Director may not stand for reelection after age 70, but need not resign until the end of his or her term. The Board may, however, upon evaluation of a Director that has reached 70 years of age, in its discretion ask such Director to remain on the Board in extraordinary circumstances if the Board believes that such Director will continue to make significant contributions to the work of the Board.
        No director shall be eligible to be reelected to the Board of Directors after serving on the Board for 15 years. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Directors serving on the Board as of the first date of the adoption of these Corporate Governance Principles shall be eligible to be reelected as a Director until the first annual meeting of stockholders held after the passage of 15 years from the date of first adoption of these Corporate Governance Principles.
        In order to retain freshness in the process and to give new management the unfettered ability to provide new leadership, a retiring CEO shall not continue to serve on the Board except in extraordinary circumstances.
        Conflict of Interest
        From time to time, an issue being considered by the Board may present, or may give the appearance of presenting, a conflict of interest for a Director. Each Director should take appropriate steps to assure that in each matter considered that the Director is disinterested with respect to that matter, other than the interests of AutoZone and its stockholders. Any Director faced with any potential conflict should disclose any such potential conflict to the Secretary and the Chairman and should not participate in discussions or votes on such issue unless a majority of the Board determines, after consultation with counsel, that no conflict of interest exists as to such matter.
        Directors that are not independent Directors shall not participate in the Board's decision of selection, removal, or performance assessment of the CEO.
BOARD ORGANIZATION
        Board Size
        In general, smaller boards are more cohesive, work better together and tend to be more effective monitors than larger boards. Ideally, the Board should be comprised of six to ten outside Directors and one to two Directors who also are employees or officers.
        Committees
        All major decisions will be considered by the Board as a whole. As a consequence, the committee structure of the Board is limited to those committees considered to be basic to or required for the operation of AutoZone as a publicly-owned entity. Standing committees shall include audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance. The audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees shall be composed solely of independent Directors. The Board may form other committees as it determines appropriate. Each committee shall operate in accordance with its charter as adopted by the Board. Committee members and chairs shall be appointed annually by the Board in accordance with the charter of each committee.
BOARD OPERATIONS
        Meetings
        The agenda for each Board meeting shall be determined by the Chairman. Each Director is encouraged to suggest agenda items.
        The Board shall meet at least four times per fiscal year in accordance with a meeting schedule that is approved by the Board. The Board may also meet at such other times in meetings which may be called in accordance with AutoZone's Bylaws.
       Other members of management may attend non-executive meetings of the Board at the invitation of the Chairman.
        Communications
        Directors have full access to the Chairman and CEO and senior officers reporting directly to the CEO and to information about the corporation's operations. Directors should refrain from giving strategic or operating direction to members of management outside the scope of full Board or committee responsibility and accountability.
        Board Ability to Retain Advisors
        The Board shall retain advisors as it believes to be appropriate. If management is retaining advisors to the Board, such decision must be ratified by the Board.
        Material in Advance of Meetings
        The Board must be given sufficient information to fully exercise its governance functions. This information comes from a variety of sources, including management reports, a comparison of performance to plans, security analysts' reports, articles in various business publications, etc. Generally, Board members will receive information prior to Board meetings so they will have an opportunity to reflect properly on the items to be considered at the meeting.
        The Board will ensure that adequate time is provided for full discussion of important items and that management presentations are scheduled in a manner that permits a substantial proportion of Board meeting time to be available for open discussion.
        Executive Session
        The non-management Directors should meet privately in executive session from time to time to review the performance of the CEO and other executive officers. The non-management Directors should meet in executive session at the end of each Board meeting to consider other issues that they may determine from time to time, without the presence of any member of management. A "non-management" Director is a Director that is not an officer of AutoZone.
        Evaluation of the CEO
        The selection and evaluation of the chief executive officer and concurrence with the CEO's selection and evaluation of the corporation's top management team are the most important function of the Board. In its broader sense, "selection and evaluation" includes considering compensation, planning for succession and, when appropriate, replacing the CEO or other members of the top management team. The performance of the CEO will be reviewed at least annually solely by the outside Directors without the presence of the CEO or other inside Directors. The evaluation of the CEO shall be led by the chair of the compensation committee. The Board should have an understanding with the CEO with respect to criteria on which he or she will be evaluated, and the results of the evaluation will be communicated to the CEO.
        Succession and Management Development
        The CEO will report annually to the Board on AutoZone's program for succession and management development.
        CEO succession is a Board-driven, collaborative process. Although the current CEO has an important role to play, the Board must own the plan for succession while collaborating with the CEO in deciding the timing and the necessary qualifications for making a final decision.
       Outside Communication
        The Board believes that management speaks for the company. In accordance with this philosophy, Directors should defer to the Chairman or AutoZone's public relations department when requested to make any comments regarding AutoZone or its business.
       Annual Election of Directors
        In order to create greater alignment between the Board's and our stockholders' interests and to promote greater accountability to the stockholders, Directors shall be elected annually.
PERIODIC REVIEW OF GUIDELINES
Amended:        December 13, 2001                        August 27, 2002
        These guidelines shall be reviewed periodically by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and any amendments shall be presented to the Board for adoption.

______________________________
        *Management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement.  

                Section 1. The Corporation may have offices at such places both within and without the State of Nevada as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.               Section 1. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Nevada as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.             Section 1. Subject to any limitations in the laws of the State of Nevada, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the number of directors may be changed from time to time by resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors or the stockholders. No reduction of the number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of his term of office. A director need not be a stockholder of the Corporation. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting may be made at such meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, by any committee or persons appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Article III, Section 1. Such nominations by any stockholder shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90) day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.             Section 4. The directors may hold their meetings and have one or more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation outside of the State of Nevada.             Section 10. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power in reference to amending the Articles of Incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the By-Laws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution, By-Laws, or the Articles of Incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt Articles of Merger.             Section 13. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he either is not liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person is liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.             Section 1. The officers of this Corporation shall be chosen by the Board of Directors and shall include a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Corporation may also have at the discretion of the Board of Directors such other officers as are desired, including a Chairman of the Board, one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 hereof. In the event there are two or more Vice Presidents, then one or more may be designated as Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President, or other similar or dissimilar title. At the time of the election of officers, the directors may by resolution determine the order of their rank. Any number of offices may be held by the same person, unless the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws otherwise provide.             Section 6. The Chairman of the Board, if such an officer be elected, shall, if present, preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may be from time to time assigned to him by the Board of Directors or prescribed by these By-Laws. The Chairman of the Board shall in addition be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and shall have the powers and duties prescribed in Section 7 of this Article IV, if no such officer is elected.             Section 7. Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the Board of Directors to the Chairman of the Board, if there be such an officer, the Chief Executive Officer shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors, have general supervision, direction and control of the business and officers of the Corporation. He shall preside at all meetings of the Stockholders and, if there is no Chairman of the Board, at all meetings of the Board of Directors. He shall be an ex-officio member of all committees and shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of Chief Executive Officer of corporations, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these By-Laws.             Section 8. In the absence or disability of the Chief Executive Officer, the President shall perform all duties of the Chief Executive Officer, and when so acting shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the Chief Executive Officer. He shall be an ex-officio member of all committees and shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of President of corporations, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these By-Laws.             Section 9. In the absence or disability of the President, the Vice Presidents (including those designated as Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President, or other similar or dissimilar title) in order of their rank as fixed by the Board of Directors, or if not ranked, the Vice President designated by the Board of Directors, shall perform all the duties of the President, and when so acting shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the President. The Vice Presidents shall have such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed for them, respectively, by the Board of Directors.             Section 10. The Secretary shall attend all sessions of the Board of Directors and all meetings of the stockholders and record all votes and the minutes of all proceedings in a book to be kept for that purpose; and shall perform like duties for the standing committees when required by the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and of the Board of Directors, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these By-Laws. The Secretary shall keep in safe custody the seal of the Corporation, and affix the same to any instrument requiring it, and when so affixed it shall be attested by his signature or by the signature of an Assistant Secretary. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by his signature.             Section 12. The Treasurer shall have the custody of the corporate funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the Corporation and shall deposit all moneys, and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the Corporation, in such depositories as may be designated by the Board of Directors. He shall disburse the funds of the Corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements, and shall render to the Board of Directors, at its regular meetings, or when the Board of Directors so requires, an account of all his transactions as Treasurer and of the financial condition of the Corporation. If required by the Board of Directors, he shall give the Corporation a bond, in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board of Directors, for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of his death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his possession or under his control belonging to the Corporation.             Section 1. Every holder of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares represented by the certificate owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.             Section 4. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.               Section 5. Upon surrender to the Corporation, or the transfer agent of the Corporation, of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books .             Section 6. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.               Section 7. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Nevada.             Section 1.

Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these By-Laws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in any manner as may be permitted by law reasonably intended to give actual notice, to such address, physical or electronic, as appears on the records of the Corporation, with any required postage prepaid.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
            Section 2. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time and place as may be fixed by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as is properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.
            To be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement or amendment thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
            A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, Section 2. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, Section 2, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place, date and hour of the annual meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.
            Section 3. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the Corporation's stock at any meeting of stockholders, which are present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these By-Laws. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum and the votes present may continue to transact business until adjournment. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the voting stock represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat.
            Section 4. When a quorum is present at any meeting, action of the stockholders on a matter other than the election of directors is approved if the number of votes cast in favor of the action exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the action, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, or the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-Laws, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders.
            Section 5. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy appointed in a reasonable manner as may be permitted by law, including, without limitation, a signed writing, telegram, facsimile, and electronic communication. All proxies must be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be counted in any vote at the meeting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in his name on the books of the Corporation on the record date set by the Board of Directors as provided in Article V, Section 6 hereof.
            Section 6. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose, or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board or President and shall be called by the President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors or by the holders of a majority of the shares of voting stock. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. Written notice of a request for a meeting by the holders of a majority of the voting shares shall be accompanied by the name and record address of the stockholders proposing the special meeting, and the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by each stockholder, and a description of any material interest of the stockholder in such business.
            Section 7. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The written notice of any meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
            Section 8. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
            Section 9. Stockholders of the Corporation may only take action at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may not take action by written consent without a meeting.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified; provided, however, that unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or law, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, either with or without cause, from the Board of Directors at any meeting of stockholders by the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of the Corporation's stock.
            Section 2. Vacancies on the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or otherwise, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of directors and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the voting power of the Corporation's stock may summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
            Section 3. The property and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-Laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

            Section 5. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.
            Section 6. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman or the President on twenty-four hours' notice to each director; special meetings shall be called by the Chairman, the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the Board consists of only one director; in which case special meetings shall be called by the Chairman, the President or Secretary in like manner or on like notice on the written request of the sole director.
            Section 7. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum, shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall constitute a quorum.
            Section 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.
            Section 9. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.  
COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS
            Section 11. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.  
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.  
INDEMNIFICATION
            (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. Indemnification shall not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.
            (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he must be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.
            (d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b), unless ordered by a court shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination shall be made (1) by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation's stock, (2) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding, (3) if a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the act, suit or proceeding so order, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) if a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
            (e) Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 13. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
            (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to the other paragraphs of this Section 13, (i) does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to paragraph (b) or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to paragraph (e), may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action; and (ii) continues for a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section 13 is not paid in full within ninety (90) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
            (g) The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of a majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors, the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 13.
            (h) The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation to enter into a contract with any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than those provided for in this Section 13.
            (i) For the purposes of this Section 13, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section with respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence had continued.
            (j) For purposes of this section, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this section.

The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

Very truly yours,
 
AUTOZONE, INC.
        The opinions expressed in paragraph (iii) above are based upon the assumption for purposes of such opinions and without independent analysis that notwithstanding the respective choice of law clauses in the Credit Documents, the governing law with respect to each of the Credit Documents is identical in all relevant respects to the law of the State of Tennessee.  Insofar as such opinion relates to the enforceability of any instrument, such enforceability is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).  The enforceability of the remedies provided under the Credit Agreement may also be limited by applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided therein but which do not in my opinion affect the validity of the Credit Agreement or make such remedies inadequate for the practical realization of the benefits intended to be provided.

FORM OF LEGAL OPINION
Schedule 4.1(g)
This is the form of legal opinion delivered by AutoZone in connection with prior AutoZone credit facilities.
[DATE]
Fleet National Bank, as Administrative Agent,     and each of the Lenders party to the     Credit Agreements referred to below c/o Fleet National Bank Agency Services
100 Federal Street MADE10307C Boston, MA  02110 Attn:  Agency Services
            RE:    AutoZone, Inc. Syndicated Credit Agreement
  Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I am the Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("AutoZone"), and am familiar with the transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 21, 2002, among AutoZone, Inc., as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, Fleet National Bank as Administrative Agent, Chase Manhattan Bank, as Syndication Agent ("Credit Agreement").  Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in this opinion which are specifically defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement.
        In connection with the opinions expressed below, I have examined, or caused to be examined, the Credit Documents.  I have relied upon the representations and warranties contained in each of such documents and upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, documents and other instruments as in my judgment are relevant to rendering the opinions expressed below.  As to all matters of fact covered by such documents, I have relied, without independent investigation or verification on such documents.  In such examination, I have assumed that each of the parties to the Credit Agreement, other than AutoZone, had and has, as the case may be, full power, authority and legal right to enter into each Credit Document to which it is a party and that each such Credit Document was or has been, as the case may be, duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of such parties.
        Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
(i)        Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation or limited partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with corporate or partnership, as the case may be, power and authority to own its properties and conduct its ordinary course of business;
  (ii)        Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation or limited partnership, as the case may be, for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction;
(iii)        Each of the Credit Documents to which AutoZone is a party, was or has been, as the case may be, duly authorized, executed and delivered by AutoZone and together constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of AutoZone enforceable against AutoZone in accordance with its and their terms.
        I do not express any opinion as to matters governed by any law other than the Federal laws of the United States of America, the corporation law of the State of Nevada and the laws of the State of Tennessee.  Further, I express no opinion as to the enforceability of the choice of law provisions contained in any of the Credit Documents.
        This opinion is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described above.  This opinion may not be used or relied upon by any other person, and may not be disclosed, quoted, filed with a governmental agency or otherwise referred to without my prior written consent except to your bank examiners, auditors and counsel and to prospective transferees of your interests under the Credit Documents and their professional advisers, or as required by law or pursuant to legal process.  
Very truly yours,

Material Litigation
Coalition For a Level Playing Field
AutoZone, Inc., is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C., v. AutoZone, Inc., Wal-mart Stores, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, Inc., The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc.," filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in February 2000. The case was filed by over 100 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers. The plaintiffs claim in the Complaint that the defendants have knowingly received volume discounts, rebates, slotting and other allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits, and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. The plaintiffs, in an amended Complaint, stated that they seek substantially more than $1 billion in damages (including statutory trebling) and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from committing further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act and from opening any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants continue to violate the Act.  AutoZone, Inc., answered the complaint on February 15, 2002, denying the plaintiff's allegations. The parties will now enter into a period of discovery related to the merits of the case.  The Company will vigorously defend against this case, and believes the suit to be without merit and that the Company will ultimately prevail.  The Company currently believes that this matter will not likely result in liabilities material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

        THIS AGREEMENT is between AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation and its various subsidiaries (collectively "AutoZone"), and William C. Rhodes, III an individual ("Employee") dated as of June 20, 2001 ("Effective Date"). For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties are agreed as follows: 1.        AutoZone agrees to employ Employee and Employee agrees to remain in the employment of AutoZone, or a subsidiary or affiliate, until the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 2.        This agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of two years unless it is earlier terminated pursuant to Paragraph 8, 9, or 10. 3.        Employee shall receive a salary from AutoZone as follows:  During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall receive annual compensation of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), subject to increases as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Base Salary").  The Base Salary amount shall be paid on a pro-rated basis for all partial years based on a 364 day year. AutoZone reserves the right to increase the Base Salary above the amounts stated above in its sole discretion. All salary shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner that AutoZone's other officers are paid. 4.        During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall receive a bonus up to 50% of his Base Salary in accordance with policies and procedures established by AutoZone's Compensation Committee and Board of Directors which shall be based upon the financial and operational goals and objectives for the Employee and AutoZone established by the Compensation Committee for each of AutoZone's fiscal years ("Target") in accordance with AutoZone's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.  The Target is established at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors and is subject to review and revision at any time upon notification to the Employee.  All bonuses shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner that AutoZone's other officers are paid. 5.        Employee shall serve as AutoZone's Senior Vice President performing such duties as AutoZone's Board of Directors may direct from time to time and as are normally associated with such a position. AutoZone may, in its sole discretion, alter, expand or curtail the services to be performed by Employee or position held by Employee from time to time, without adjustment in compensation. Employee shall devote his entire time and attention to AutoZone's business. During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall not engage in any other business activity that conflicts with his duties with AutoZone, regardless of whether it is pursued for gain or profit. Employee may, however, invest his assets in or serve on the Board of Directors of other companies so long as they do not require Employee's services in the day to day operation of their affairs and do not violate AutoZone's conflict of interest policy.  Notwithstanding, Employee may from time to time invest deminimus amounts in the publicly traded stock of Competitors upon written approval of AutoZone's General Counsel. 6.        Other benefits to be received by Employee from AutoZone shall be the ordinary benefits received by AutoZone's other executive officers, which may be changed by AutoZone in its sole discretion from time to time. 7.        Employee understands that all salary, bonus and other benefits will be subject to reduction for amounts required to be withheld by law as taxes and otherwise. 8.        9.        Employee may terminate this Agreement at anytime upon written notice to AutoZone. Upon such termination, Employee's employment shall terminate and Employee shall cease to receive any further salary, benefits, or bonus, and all stock options granted shall be governed by the respective stock option agreement(s) between the Employee and AutoZone. 10.        Employee may terminate this Agreement upon a Change of Control of AutoZone by giving written notice to AutoZone within sixty days of the occurrence of a Change of Control.  Upon giving such notice to AutoZone, Employees employment shall terminate and Employee shall cease to receive any payments or benefits pursuant this Agreement and all stock options held by Employee shall be governed by the respective stock option agreement(s).  Any of the following events shall constitute a "Change of Control":  (a) the acquisition after the date hereof, in one or more transactions, of beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3(a)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")), by any person or entity or any group of persons or entities who constitute a group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) under the Exchange Act) of any securities such that as a result of such acquisition such person, entity or group beneficially owns AutoZone, Inc.'s then outstanding voting securities representing 51% or more of the total combined voting power entitled to vote on a regular basis for a majority of the board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc. or (b) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of AutoZone (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation, lease or transfer) in a transaction where AutoZone or the beneficial owners (as defined in Rule 13d-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act) of capital stock of AutoZone do not receive (i) voting securities representing a majority of the total combined voting power entitled to vote on a regular basis for the board of directors of the acquiring entity or of an affiliate which controls the acquiring entity or (ii) securities representing a majority of the total combined equity interest in the acquiring entity, if other than a corporation; provided however, that the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 10 shall not apply to any transfer, sale or disposition of shares of capital stock of AutoZone to any person or persons who are affiliates of AutoZone on the date hereof. 11.        Any termination of Employee's service as an officer of AutoZone shall be deemed a termination of Employee's service on all boards and as an officer of all subsidiaries of AutoZone. 12.        Employee agrees that he will not, for the period commencing on the termination date of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 8 or 9 (whichever is applicable) of this Agreement and ending on

Termination by AutoZone.
(a) .  AutoZone may terminate this Agreement without Cause at any time upon notice to Employee. In such event, Employee shall continue to be paid his then current Base Salary (on a pro-rated basis in the same manner as Employee is then receiving his base salary) until two years after the termination date ("Continuation Period").  During the Continuation Period, Employee shall not receive any bonus payments.  During the Continuation Period, Employee shall continue to be an employee of AutoZone or a subsidiary of AutoZone available to perform such services as may be requested by the Chief Executive Officer of AutoZone, and Employee's stock options shall continue to vest and may be exercised in the manner set forth in the respective stock option agreements until the end of the Continuation Period, at which time Employee's employment with AutoZone shall be terminated and further stock option exercise and vesting shall be governed by the terms of the stock option agreement.  During the Continuation Period, Employee shall receive such other benefits as other employees of AutoZone, including, but not limited to, health and life insurance, on the same terms and conditions.  AutoZone shall pay Employee a prorated bonus for the fiscal year in which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph calculated based on the period of time elapsed during such fiscal year until this Agreement is terminated and the formula established by the Compensation Committee for officers for that fiscal year.  Said bonus shall be paid when other officer bonuses are paid for that fiscal year.  AutoZone shall have no other obligations other than those stated herein upon the termination of this Agreement and Employee hereby releases AutoZone from any and all obligations and claims except those as are specifically set forth herein.
Without Cause
(b) .  AutoZone shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment with AutoZone and all subsidiaries of AutoZone for Cause at any time.  Upon such termination for Cause, Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation, salary, or bonus and shall immediately cease to receive any benefits (other than those as may be required pursuant to the AutoZone Pension Plan or by law) and any stock options shall be governed by the respective stock option agreements in effect between the Employee and AutoZone at that time.  "Cause" shall mean the willful engagement by the Employee in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to AutoZone or any subsidiary of AutoZone, monetarily or otherwise.  For this purpose, no act or failure to act by the Employee shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of AutoZone or any subsidiary of AutoZone.

be engaged in or concerned with, directly or indirectly, any business related to or involved in the retail sale of auto parts to "DIY" customers, or the wholesale or retail sale of auto parts to commercial installers in any state, province, territory or foreign country in which AutoZone or any subsidiary of AutoZone operates now or shall operate during the term set forth in this non-compete paragraph (herein called "Competitor"), as an employee, director, consultant, beneficial or record owner, partner, joint venturer, officer or agent of the Competitor. The parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Non-Compete section have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time, scope, geographic area and other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances and are in exchange for the obligations undertaken by AutoZone pursuant to this Agreement.  Further, Employee agrees not to hire, for himself or any other entity, encourage anyone or entity to hire, or entice away from AutoZone any employee of AutoZone or any subsidiary of AutoZone during the term of this non-compete obligation. If at any time a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any portion of this Non-Compete section is unenforceable for any reason, then Employee shall forfeit his right to any further salary, bonus, or benefits from AutoZone during any Continuation Period.  This Paragraph 12 shall not apply to a termination by Employee pursuant to Paragraph 10. 13.        Unless otherwise required by law, Employee shall hold in confidence any proprietary or confidential information obtained by him during his employment with AutoZone, which shall include, but not be limited to, information regarding AutoZone's present and future business plans, vendors, systems, operations and personnel. Confidential information shall not include information: (a) publicly disclosed by AutoZone; (b) rightfully received by Employee from a third party without restrictions on disclosure (c) approved for release or disclosure by AutoZone; or (d) produced or disclosed pursuant to applicable laws, regulation or court order.  Employee acknowledges that all such confidential or proprietary information is and shall remain the sole property of AutoZone and all embodiments of such information shall remain with AutoZone. 14.        .  The parties further agree that if, at any time, despite the express agreement of the parties hereto, Employee violates the provisions of this Agreement by violating the Non-Compete or Confidentiality sections, or by failing to perform his obligations under this Agreement, AutoZone may cease paying any further salary or bonus in addition to any other rights AutoZone may have at law or equity.  In the event of breach by Employee of any provision of this Agreement, Employee acknowledges that such breach will cause irreparable damage to AutoZone, the exact amount of which will be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that remedies at law for any such breach will be inadequate.  Accordingly, AutoZone shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights or remedies existing in its favor, to obtain, without the necessity for any bond or other security, specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce, or prevent breach of any such provision. 15.        If Employee should die or become disabled (such that he is no longer capable of performing his duties) during the term of this Agreement, then all salary and bonus shall cease as of the date of his death or disability, all stock options shall be governed by the terms of the respective stock option agreements, and Employee shall receive disability or death benefits as may be provided under AutoZone's then existing policies and procedures related to disability or death of AutoZone employees. 16.        Any waiver of any breach of this Agreement by AutoZone shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Employee. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of AutoZone. 17.        Employee acknowledges that his services are unique and personal. Accordingly, Employee shall not assign his rights or delegate his duties or obligations under this Agreement. Employee's rights and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon AutoZone successors and assigns. AutoZone may assign this Agreement to any wholly-owned subsidiary operating for the use and benefit of AutoZone. 18.        This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties related to the matters discussed herein. It may not be changed orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, extension, or discharge is sought. 19.        This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law rules.  The parties agree that the only proper venue for any dispute under this Agreement shall be in the state or federal courts located in Shelby County, Tennessee. 20.        Sections 8, 12, 13, 14 and 19 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement or Employee's employment with AutoZone (including, without limitation termination pursuant to Paragraphs 8, 9, or 10). IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the respective parties execute this Agreement. AUTOZONE, INC.                                                    EMPLOYEE

If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. (f) Blue Sky Qualifications. The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Underwritten Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Underwritten Securities have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of such Terms Agreement. (g) Earnings Statement. The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11 (a) of the 1933 Act. 12
(h) Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Underwritten Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds". (i) Listing. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Underwritten Securities, prior to the Closing Time, on any national securities exchange or quotation system if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. (j) Restriction on Sale of Securities. Between the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and the Closing Time or such other date specified in such Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer or contract to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, the securities specified in such Terms Agreement. (k) Reporting Requirements. The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. SECTION 4. Payment of Expenses. (a) Expenses.

Except as set forth in clauses (v) and (ix) of this Section 4(a) or upon termination of this Underwriting Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or 9(b)(i), the Company shall not be obligated to pay any fees or disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters. (b) Termination of Agreement. If the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated by the Representatives in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or Section 9(b)(i) hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters. SECTION 5. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 hereof or in certificates of any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement.

At Closing Time, the Representatives shall have received the favorable opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, dated as of Closing Time, of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel to the Underwriters, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters. In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States, upon the opinions of counsel satisfactory to the Representatives. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials. 14
(d) Officers' Certificate. At Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the chief financial officer or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1(a) are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Time, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted, are pending or, to the best of such officer's knowledge, are threatened by the Commission. (e) Accountant's Comfort Letter. At the time of the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (f) Bring-down Comfort Letter. At Closing Time, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter, dated as of Closing Time, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section 5, except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Time. (g) Ratings. At Closing Time and at any relevant Date of Delivery, the Underwritten Securities shall have the ratings accorded by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations) if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, and the Company shall have delivered to the Representatives a letter, dated as of such date, from each such rating organization, or other evidence satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that the Underwritten Securities have such ratings. Since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred a downgrading in, or withdrawal of, the rating assigned to the Underwritten Securities or any of the Company's other securities by any such rating organization, and no such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review its rating of the Underwritten Securities or any of the Company's other securities. (h) Approval of Listing. At Closing Time, the Underwritten Securities shall have been approved for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance, if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. 15
(i) No Objection. If the Registration Statement or an offering of Underwritten Securities has been filed with the NASD for review, the NASD shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements. (j) Additional Documents. At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, counsel to the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities as herein contemplated, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities as herein contemplated shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters. (k) Termination of Terms Agreement. If any condition specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, the applicable Terms Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time (or such Date of Delivery, as applicable), and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 and except that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive any such termination and remain in full force and effect. SECTION 6. Indemnification (a) Indemnification of Underwriters. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in 16
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Underwriter, in contravention of a requirement of this Underwriting Agreement or applicable law, sold Securities to a person to whom such Underwriter failed to send or give, at or prior to the Closing Date, a copy of the Final Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented if (1) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof, in accordance with Section 3(d) of this Underwriting Agreement at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time, to the Underwriters and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Underwriter resulted from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Final Prospectus as, if applicable, amended or supplemented prior to the Closing Date and such Final Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person and (2) such failure to give or send such Final Prospectus by the Closing Date to the party or parties asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense. (b) Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the 17
extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by 18
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls 19
the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities. SECTION 9. Termination (a) Underwriting Agreement. This Underwriting Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Company or by either of the Representatives upon the giving of 30 days' prior written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. (b) Terms Agreement. The Representatives may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time or any relevant Date of Delivery, if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Underwritten Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof, a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the 20
Underwritten Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States. (c) Liabilities. If this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect. SECTION 10. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. SECTION 11. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Underwriting Agreement or such Terms Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Underwriting Agreement or such Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained.

The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on April 15, 2003. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Original Issue Date shown above. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 1 or the October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such
2 interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Company, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange upon which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. The Company will pay interest on overdue principal, overdue premium, if any, and overdue installments of interest, if any, from time to time on demand at the interest rate borne by the Notes to the extent lawful. In the event this Global Note is surrendered in exchange for Notes in definitive form, principal and interest payable with respect to Notes in definitive form will be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in New York, New York (the Place of Payment), in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest payable with respect to such Notes in definitive form, may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register. This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities") evidencing its unsecured indebtedness, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to a senior indenture, dated as of July 22, 1998, (herein referred to as the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a series designated as the "5.875% Notes due 2012" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000). The Company may, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise similar in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the
3 principal amount of such Notes; or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 0.35%. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations. "Quotation Agent" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or another Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. and their respective successors and any other U.S. Government securities dealer the Company shall select; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City, the Company shall substitute therefor another primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
4 In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. Any such waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Outstanding Securities or, in certain cases, of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest, if any, thereon, or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which any Security or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be) or (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities or the Outstanding Securities of any particular series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults thereunder or their consequences provided for in the Indenture. It is also provided in the Indenture that prior to the acceleration of maturity of the Securities of any particular series upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to such series as permitted by the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default under the Indenture with respect to Securities of such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the security Register of the Company,
5 upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Security Registrar, or at the office of any Security Co-Registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Security Registrar or any such Security Co-Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of the same aggregate principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. If definitive Notes are so delivered, the Company may make such changes to the form of this Note as are necessary or appropriate to allow for the issuance of such definitive Notes. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, any Security Co-Registrar and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, any Security, the Registrar nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer or stockholder, past, present or future, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives any such claim against any such Person. The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. Unless the certificate of authentication thereon has been executed by the Trustee under such indenture, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under such Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

AutoZone EPS up 37% in First Quarter
Memphis, Tenn.  ( December 12, 2002) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO), today reported sales of $1.219 billion for its first fiscal quarter (12 weeks) ended November 23, 2002, an increase of 4% from fiscal 2002. Excluding the sales of the TruckPro subsidiary which was sold in December, 2001, sales increased 7%. Same store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts stores open at least one year, increased 4.5% during the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter improved by more than one percentage point, while operating expenses, as a percent of sales, declined by more than one percentage point, resulting in a 15.5% operating margin. Net income for the quarter increased 25% to $105 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $1.04 from $0.76 reported in the year-ago quarter. Return on invested capital for the trailing twelve months increased to 20.6%.
"We are very pleased with our continuing strong performance through the first quarter, even as we anniversary our strong improvements in the prior year," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are very encouraged by the 30% sales increase in our AZ Commercial business reflecting our commercial customers' positive response to our high level of service and extensive product offering.
"Our continued focus on controlling costs through relentless expense discipline continues to drive shareholder value. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined to 29.6% in the first quarter. This rate is the lowest first quarter rate achieved since 1995. The strong, growing cash flow provided by our business, when combined with our high hurdle rates for new investments, should continue to drive improved return on invested capital and shareholder value."

"We are pleased with our strong performance through the second quarter, even as we anniversaried 12% same store sales increases from the prior year," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  "The 29% same store sales increase in our AZ Commercial business reflects our commercial customers' positive response to our efforts.  Additionally, we are excited about our new advertising initiatives.
"Our continued focus on controlling costs through relentless expense discipline continues to drive shareholder value.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 1.62 percentage points to 31.1% in the second quarter.  This rate is the lowest second quarter rate achieved since 1995.  Additionally, we maintained our inventory per store at levels not exceeding the first quarter while reducing net inventory per store versus the previous year.
"AutoZone believes in the highest level of integrity in its operations and financial reporting.  Among other things during 2000, we created a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which is comprised of independent directors.  We restructured our Board of Directors, repealed our poison pill, and instituted a code of conduct.  I am proud to say that our efforts have been recognized recently by Institutional Shareholder Services.  Out of 5,000 companies assessed, ISS ranked AutoZone in the top ten in its overall Corporate Governance Quotient Research Tool.  This rating confirms that we are focused on the right things for instilling honest, clear decision making procedures in all our day-to-day activities."
Additionally, AutoZone, Inc. announced on January 29, 2003 that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's common stock, in connection with the ongoing share repurchase program.  During the quarter, the company purchased 3.8 million shares for $259 million, including $178 million purchased under forward purchase contracts.  Since 1998, cumulative share repurchases under the share repurchase program were $2.39 billion, or 66.3 million shares at an average price of $36.08 per share, including $297.5 million, or 4.3 million shares, under forward purchase contracts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company purchased 1.5 million shares in settlement of certain forward contracts outstanding as of February 15, 2003, at an average cost of $64.92 per share.

AUTOZONE EPS UP 36%;
ROIC IMPROVES TO 22.3%;
NEW DIRECTOR ELECTED
Memphis, Tenn. (May 27, 2003) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.288 billion for its third fiscal quarter (12 weeks) ended May 10, 2003, an increase of 5.2% from fiscal 2002.  Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 2.8% during the quarter, including flat retail comparable sales and 30% for commercial comparable sales.  Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 223 basis points, while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 10 basis points.  This resulted in a 17.2% operating margin, up 233 basis points from last year.  Net income for the quarter increased by 23% to $126.0 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 36% to $1.30 from $0.96 reported in the year-ago quarter.  Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to 22.3%.
For the fiscal year-to-date period (36 weeks), sales were $3.628 billion, an increase of 4.2% from the previous year, with a same store sales increase of 3.2%.  Year-to-date net income increased 24% to $310.2 million, and diluted earnings per share for the period increased 36% to $3.12 from $2.29.  On a trailing four quarters basis, AutoZone achieved a 4.3% same store sales increase, including 2.0% for retail and 25.5% for commercial.  Additionally, inventory levels per store declined from the second quarter level of $471 thousand to $469 thousand.  Even with these reductions, the Company's payables to inventory ratio rose from 70% last quarter to 73% this quarter. Net inventory (inventory net of accounts payable) per store declined from the second quarter level of $140 thousand to $128 thousand.
"We are pleased with our strong performance throughout the third quarter, even as we anniversaried 9.5% same store sales increases from the prior year," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  "The 30% same store sales increase in our AZ Commercial business continues to reflect our commercial customers' positive response to our efforts.  This is the third straight quarter of roughly 30% AZ Commercial comparable sales increases.  Not only have we continued to add valued local commercial customers, we have added valued chain accounts.  Additionally, our ongoing focus on gross margin improvement and relentless expense discipline continues to drive shareholder value.  The combined impact of these efforts improved operating margin by 233 basis points over last year."
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $285 million during the third quarter, including $119 million purchased under forward purchase contracts.  Since 1998, cumulative share repurchases have been $2.676 billion, or 70.2 million shares at an average price of $38.09 per share, including $295.4 million, or 4.0 million shares, under forward purchase contracts yet to be settled.  Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company purchased these 4.0 million shares in settlement of all remaining forward contracts outstanding as of May 10, 2003, at an average cost of $74.54 per share.
Also today, the Board of Directors elected James Postl as a new outside director.  Mr. Postl is the retired president and chief executive officer of Pennzoil-Quaker State Company.  Prior to that he served in various senior management positions at Nabisco Inc., Pepsico Inc. and Procter & Gamble.  He is active in the community, chairing the board of the American Heart Association, serving on the Council of Overseers for Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University, and on the boards of the Houston Area Women's Center and the Society for the Performing Arts.  "We are pleased to add Jim to our board.  His industry expertise and experience ensure he will be a valued contributor," said Steve Odland.
As required by the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor" (Issue 02-16), AutoZone reflected the new accounting for new and modified vendor funding arrangements during the third quarter.  This resulted in a non-cash pretax charge of $2.6 million (or $0.02 per share) during the quarter.  Additionally, as a result of Issue 02-16, for the twelve and thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2003, selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately $15.6 million higher and gross margin was approximately $13 million higher than such amounts would have been otherwise.  Excluding the impact of the new pronouncement, gross margin for the quarter would have been 45.5% (vs. 44.3% last year) and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales would have been 28.0% (vs. 29.4% last year).
The new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding will not impact the way AutoZone runs its business or its relationships with vendors.  It is a non-cash effect.  Based on the timing of the issuance of the pronouncement and guidelines, AutoZone was precluded from adopting Issue 02-16 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  Had AutoZone been permitted to adopt Issue 02-16 for all vendor funding arrangements that existed at September 1, 2002, the estimated impact on operating profit for fiscal 2003 would have been a decrease of approximately $25 million (or $0.16 per share -- based on third quarter diluted share count).  While the timing of the recognition for the remaining impact will be dependent on the timing of modifications of existing vendor agreements, the Company anticipates that a significant portion will be recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call Wednesday, May 28, 2003, beginning at 9 a.m. (CDT) to discuss the third quarter results.  Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone website, by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls," or by going directly to .  The call will also be available by dialing (210) 234-0004.  A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website.

(together, the "Representatives"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives, the Company will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representatives and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Representatives (the "Underwriters," which term shall include the Representatives, whether acting as the only Underwriters or as members of an underwriting syndicate, as well as any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the number or aggregate principal
amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be initially issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter other than the Representatives acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities which each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and the Representatives, acting for themselves and, if applicable, as representatives of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities through the Representatives as the only Underwriters or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives will be governed by this Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-100205) for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable), including the information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 430A Information") or Rule 434(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 434 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, further, that if the Company files a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, after such filing, all references to "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule 462 Registration Statement; and provided, further, that if the Company elects to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, then all references to "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include the final or preliminary prospectus and the applicable term sheet or abbreviated term sheet (the "Term Sheet"), as the case may be, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company in reliance upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to the date of the Prospectus shall mean the date of the Term Sheet. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus that omitted, as applicable, the Rule 430A Information, the Rule 434 Information or 2
other information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the execution and delivery of the applicable Terms Agreement. For purposes of this Underwriting Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus, Term Sheet or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). All references in this Underwriting Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement. SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. (a) Representations and Warranties by the Company. The Company represents and warrants to the Representatives, as of the date hereof, and to each Underwriter named in the applicable Terms Agreement, as of the date thereof, as of the Closing Time (as defined below) and, if applicable, as of each Date of Delivery (as defined below) (in each case, a "Representation Date"), as follows: (i) Compliance with Registration Requirements. The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act. The Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) has become effective under the 1933 Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (or such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. In addition, each Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act. At the respective times the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) and any post-effective amendments thereto (including the filing of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission (the "Annual Report on Form 10-K")) became effective and at each Representation Date, the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) and any amendments thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act (the "1939 Act Regulations") and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or 3
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. At the date of the Prospectus, at the Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if any, neither the Prospectus nor any amendments and supplements thereto included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 434. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. Each preliminary prospectus and prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement as originally filed or as part of any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of Underwritten Securities will, at the time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (ii) Incorporated Documents. The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when they became effective or at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations") and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus, at the date of the Prospectus, at the Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if any, did not and will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (iii) Independent Accountants. The accountants who certified the financial statements and any supporting schedules thereto included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus are independent public accountants as required by the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (iv) Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Company included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, together with the related schedules and notes, as well as those financial statements, schedules and notes of any other entity included therein, present fairly the financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, or such other entity, as the case may be, at the dates indicated and the statement of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, or such other entity, as the case may be, for the periods specified. Such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally 4
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. The supporting schedules, if any, included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly in accordance with GAAP the information required to be stated therein. The selected financial data included in the Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein and have been compiled on a basis consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (v) No Material Adverse Change in Business. Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as otherwise stated therein, (A) there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business (a "Material Adverse Effect"), (B) there have been no transactions entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than those arising in the ordinary course of business, which are material with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise and (C) there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of its capital stock. (vi) Good Standing of the Company. The Company has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated under, this Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. (vii) Good Standing of Subsidiaries. Each "significant subsidiary" of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the 1933 Act) (each, a "Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Subsidiaries"), if any, has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate or partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or partnership, as the case may be, to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Corporation of which the Company owns, directly and indirectly, 1,082 shares and others own 118 shares), free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock or partnership interest of any Subsidiary was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of such Subsidiary. (viii) Capitalization. If the Prospectus contains a "Capitalization" section, the stockholders' equity and the consolidated short-term and long-term debt of the Company is as set forth in the column entitled "Actual" under such section (except for (A) subsequent issuances thereof, if any, contemplated under this Underwriting Agreement, (B) pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee benefit plans referred to or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (C) repurchases of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company under its previously announced stock repurchase program, (D) pursuant to the exercise of convertible securities or options referred to or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and (E) increases not in excess of $50 million in the aggregate in consolidated long-term debt). Such shares of capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued by the Company and are fully paid and non-assessable, and none of such shares of capital stock was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company.

(x) Authorization of the Securities. The Underwritten Securities have been, or as of the date of such Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement. Such Underwritten Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for in the applicable Indenture and delivered against payment of the consideration therefor specified in such Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. Such Underwritten Securities will be in the form contemplated by, and each registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of, the applicable Indenture. (xi) Authorization of the Indentures. Each applicable Indenture has been, or prior to the issuance of the Debt Securities thereunder will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and 6
delivery, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (xii) Descriptions of the Underwritten Securities and Indentures. The Underwritten Securities being sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture, as of each Representation Date, conform in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus and are in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. (xiii) Absence of Defaults and Conflicts. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) in violation of its charter or by-laws, (b) in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject (collectively, "Agreements and Instruments"), except for such defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect or (c) in violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations, except for violations that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Underwriting Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Underwritten Securities as described under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Agreements and Instruments, nor will such action result in any violation of (a) the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations. As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder's 7
behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. (xiv) Absence of Proceedings.

The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective assets, properties or operations is the subject which are not described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(xvi) Absence of Further Requirements.

(xviii) Title to Property. The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and good title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind, except (A) as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or (B) those which do not, singly or in the aggregate, materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and delivered to any Underwriter or to counsel to the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities and dated a Representation Date shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to each Underwriter as to the matters covered thereby on such Representation Date. SECTION 2. Sale and Delivery to Underwriters; Closing. (a) Underwritten Securities. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.

(New York City time) on the third (fourth, if the pricing occurs after 4:30 P.M. (New York City time) on any given day) business day after the date of the applicable Terms Agreement (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof), or such other time not later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called "Closing Time"). Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company, against delivery to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representatives, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Underwritten Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase. The Representatives, each individually and not as representatives of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with the Representatives and with each Underwriter participating in the offering of Underwritten Securities, as follows: (a) Compliance with Securities Regulations and Commission Requests. The Company, subject to Section 3(b), will comply with the requirements of Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations and/or Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, if and as applicable, and will notify the Representative(s) immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or the filing of any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus, (ii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iii) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, and (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes. The Company will promptly effect the filings necessary pursuant to Rule 424 and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. (b) Filing of Amendments. The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations), any Term Sheet or any amendment, supplement or revision to either the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall object. To the extent the distribution of Underwritten Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representatives with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act. (c) Delivery of Registration Statements. The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representatives, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters. The Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (d) Delivery of Prospectuses. The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably 11
request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (e) Continued Compliance with Securities Laws. The Company will comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Underwritten Securities as contemplated in this Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request.

Except as set forth in clauses (v) and (ix) of this Section 4(a) or upon termination of this Underwriting Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or 9(b)(i), the Company shall not be obligated to pay any fees or disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters.

At Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business affairs, of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the chief financial officer or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1(a) are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Time, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted, are pending or, to the best of such officer's knowledge, are threatened by the Commission. (e) Accountant's Comfort Letter. At the time of the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

At Closing Time and at any relevant Date of Delivery, the Underwritten Securities shall have the ratings accorded by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations) if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, and the Company shall have delivered to the Representatives a letter, dated as of such date, from each such rating organization, or other evidence satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that the Underwritten Securities have such ratings. Since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred a downgrading in, or withdrawal of, the rating assigned to the Underwritten Securities or any of the Company's other securities by any such rating organization, and no such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review its rating of the Underwritten Securities or any of the Company's other securities. (h) Approval of Listing. At Closing Time, the Underwritten Securities shall have been approved for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance, if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. 15
(i) No Objection. If the Registration Statement or an offering of Underwritten Securities has been filed with the NASD for review, the NASD shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements. (j) Additional Documents. At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, counsel to the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities as herein contemplated, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities as herein contemplated shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters. (k) Termination of Terms Agreement. If any condition specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, the applicable Terms Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time (or such Date of Delivery, as applicable), and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 and except that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive any such termination and remain in full force and effect. SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification of Underwriters. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in 16
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Underwriter, in contravention of a requirement of this Underwriting Agreement or applicable law, sold Securities to a person to whom such Underwriter failed to send or give, at or prior to the Closing Date, a copy of the Final Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented if (1) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof, in accordance with Section 3(d) of this Underwriting Agreement at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time, to the Underwriters and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Underwriter resulted from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Final Prospectus as, if applicable, amended or supplemented prior to the Closing Date and such Final Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person and (2) such failure to give or send such Final Prospectus by the Closing Date to the party or parties asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense. (b) Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the 17
extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by 18
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls 19
the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities. SECTION 9. Termination (a) Underwriting Agreement. This Underwriting Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Company or by either of the Representatives upon the giving of 30 days' prior written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. (b) Terms Agreement. The Representatives may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time or any relevant Date of Delivery, if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Underwritten Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof, a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the 20
Underwritten Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States. (c) Liabilities. If this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect. SECTION 10. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. SECTION 11. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to the Representatives c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, attention: Investment Banking Legal Department, and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., 303 Peachtree Street, 23rd Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30308, attention: ; and notices to the Company 21

Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Underwriting Agreement or such Terms Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Underwriting Agreement or such Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained.

The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on December 1, 2003. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Original Issue Date shown above. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
2 interest, which shall be the May 15 or the November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Company, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange upon which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. The Company will pay interest on overdue principal, overdue premium, if any, and overdue installments of interest, if any, from time to time on demand at the interest rate borne by the Notes to the extent lawful. In the event this Global Note is surrendered in exchange for Notes in definitive form, principal and interest payable with respect to Notes in definitive form will be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in New York, New York (the Place of Payment), in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest payable with respect to such Notes in definitive form, may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register. This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities") evidencing its unsecured indebtedness, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to a senior indenture, dated as of July 22, 1998, (herein referred to as the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a series designated as the "4.375% Notes due 2013" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise similar in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
3 The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes; or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 0.20%. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations. "Quotation Agent" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. or another Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and their respective successors and any other primary treasury dealer the Company shall select; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary treasury dealer in New York City, the Company shall substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
4 The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund. In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. Any such waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Outstanding Securities or, in certain cases, of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest, if any, thereon, or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which any Security or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be) or (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities or the Outstanding Securities of any particular series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults thereunder or their consequences provided for in the Indenture. It is also provided in the Indenture that prior to the acceleration of maturity of the Securities of any particular series upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to such series as permitted by the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default under the Indenture with respect to Securities of such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
5 As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Security Registrar, or at the office of any Security Co-Registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Security Registrar or any such Security Co-Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of the same aggregate principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. If definitive Notes are so delivered, the Company may make such changes to the form of this Note as are necessary or appropriate to allow for the issuance of such definitive Notes. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, any Security Co-Registrar and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, any Security, the Registrar nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer or stockholder, past, present or future, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives any such claim against any such Person. The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

AutoZone Fourth Quarter GAAP EPS $2.27; Same Store Sales Up 3%; ROIC Improves to 23.4% MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.829 billion for its fourth fiscal quarter (16 weeks) ended August 30, 2003, a decrease of 0.8% from the fourth quarter (17 weeks) ended August 31, 2002. Excluding sales from the extra week included in the prior year, sales were up 5.5%. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 3% during the quarter, including an increase of 1% for retail same store sales and an increase of 24% for commercial same store sales. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 1.90 percentage points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 0.86 percentage points. This resulted in an operating margin of 19.7%, up 2.76 percentage points from last year. Operating profit increased 15% over the prior year. However, both years were impacted by certain non-recurring items including: * For fiscal 2003 fourth quarter, a $4.6 million pre-tax favorable adjustment this year for the reversal of restructuring accruals * For fiscal 2003 fourth quarter, a $7.4 million pre-tax negative impact related to the continued implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16 * For fiscal 2002 fourth quarter, a $29 million pre-tax positive impact based on the benefit of the additional week. Excluding these items, comparable operating profit increased for the quarter 28% as operating margin improved 3.55 percentage points to 19.8% from 16.3% last year. Net income for the quarter increased by 17% to $207.4 million, and diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of our share repurchase program, increased 31% to $2.27 from $1.73 reported in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the non-recurring items, comparable net income increased 31% and earnings per share increased 47%. For the fiscal year ended August 30, 2003, AutoZone reported sales of $5.457 billion (52 weeks), a 2.5% increase from fiscal 2002. Excluding sales from the extra week included in the prior year, sales were up 4.6%. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 3% during the year, including flat retail same store sales (against 8% same store sales growth last year) and an increase of 27% for commercial same store sales. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the year improved by 1.48 percentage points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 0.86 percentage points. This resulted in an operating margin of 16.8%, up 2.34 percentage points from last year. Operating profit increased 19% over the prior year. In addition to the above-mentioned non-recurring items, operating profit for the full fiscal year was also impacted by: * For fiscal 2003 third quarter, a $4.7 million pre-tax favorable adjustment associated with the sale of the TruckPro business * For fiscal 2003 third quarter, a $2.6 million pre-tax negative impact related to the implementation of EITF Issue 02-16 Excluding these items, and the fourth fiscal quarter non-recurring items, comparable operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased by 24% as operating margin improved 2.62 percentage points to 16.8% from 14.2% last year. Net income for the fiscal year increased by 21% to $517.6 million, and diluted earnings per share increased by 34% to $5.34 from $4.00 reported for the year-ago. Excluding the non-recurring items, comparable net income increased 26% and earnings per share increased 40%. Return on invested capital for the fiscal year increased to 23.4% from 19.8% the previous year. "We are very pleased with our comparable performance as we have continued to build on the growth from our prior fiscal year. Our industry-leading results continue to show that AutoZone is a significant cash generator which has enabled us to add shareholder value over time," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "This is the fourth straight quarter of over 20% AZ Commercial comparable sales increases. Not only have we continued to build our customer base in this area, but we continue to expand the volume of business we do with our existing commercial customers. "Additionally, our ongoing focus on gross margin improvement and relentless expense discipline continues to drive profitability. The combined impact of these efforts considerably improved our operating margin in the quarter over the last year." Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock for $447 million during the fourth quarter. Since 1998, cumulative share repurchases have totaled $2.827 billion, or 72.0 million shares at an average price of $39.25 per share. As required by the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor" (EITF Issue 02-16), AutoZone reflected the new accounting for new and modified vendor funding arrangements during the fourth quarter. This resulted in a non-cash pretax deferral of vendor funding of $7.4 million (or $0.05 per share) during the quarter and a reclassification of $37 million of vendor funding from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. Additionally, as a result of EITF Issue 02-16, for the sixteen weeks ended August 30, 2003, selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately $37 million higher and gross margin was approximately $30 million higher than such amounts would have been prior to the accounting change. Excluding the impact of the new pronouncement, gross margin for the quarter would have been 46.0% (vs. 45.7% last year) and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales would have been 25.9% (vs. 28.8% last year). The new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding does not impact the way AutoZone runs its business or its relationships with vendors. It is a non-cash deferral of vendor funding. Based on the timing of the issuance of the pronouncement and guidelines, AutoZone was precluded from adopting EITF Issue 02-16 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. AutoZone's timing and accounting treatment of EITF Issue 02-16 was not discretionary. The timing of recognition for the remaining pre-tax impact of approximately $15 million is expected to flow evenly over the four quarters of fiscal 2004. During the quarter AutoZone opened 68 new stores, replaced 2 stores, and closed 1 store in the U.S. and opened 6 new stores in Mexico. As of August 30, 2003, AutoZone sells auto and light truck parts, chemicals and accessories through 3,219 AutoZone stores in 48 states plus the District of Columbia in the U.S. and 49 AutoZone stores in Mexico and also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information though www.alldatadiy.com, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call this evening Monday, September 22, 2003, beginning at 4:30 p.m. (EDT) to discuss the fourth quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone website, www.autozone.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls," or by going directly to http://www.autozone.com/investors. The call will also be available by dialing (210) 234-0004. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (402) 220-9742 through Monday, September 29, 2003, at 11:00 p.m. EDT. This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results. The financial impacts of the fifty-third week of operating results last year, the recognized gain associated with the sale of this year, the adoption of EITF Issue 02-16, and, lastly, the gain related to the reversal of the restructuring reserve this year were all identified as "adjustments" for comparative purposes. Management and the Company's Compensation Committee use this information to analyze and compare the Company's underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables. Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. These statements discuss, among other things, business strategies and future performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, competition, product demand, the economy, inflation, gasoline prices, consumer debt levels, war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity, and the availability of commercial transportation. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of AutoZone's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002, for more information related to those risks. AutoZone undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell up to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior or subordinated debt securities (the "Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale.
 
The Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior or subordinated indebtedness under an indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Each series of Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the Indenture.
 
Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Securities through Banc of America Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (together, the "Representatives"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives, the Company will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representatives and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Company (the "Underwriters," which term shall include the Representatives, whether acting as the only Underwriters or as members of an underwriting syndicate, as well as any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be initially issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each
 
Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter other than the Representatives acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities which each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and the Representatives, acting for themselves and, if applicable, as representatives of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities through the Representatives as the only Underwriters or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives will be governed by this Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-107828) for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable), including the information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 430A Information") or Rule 434(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 434 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, further, that if the Company files a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, after such filing, all references to "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule 462 Registration Statement; and provided, further, that if the Company elects to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, then all references to "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include the final or preliminary prospectus and the applicable term sheet or abbreviated term sheet (the "Term Sheet"), as the case may be, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company in reliance upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to the date of the Prospectus shall mean the date of the Term Sheet. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus that omitted, as applicable, the Rule 430A Information, the Rule 434 Information or other information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission
 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the execution and delivery of the applicable Terms Agreement. For purposes of this Underwriting Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus, Term Sheet or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
 
All references in this Underwriting Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) in violation of its charter or by-laws, (b) in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject (collectively, "Agreements and Instruments"), except for such defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect or (c) in violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations, except for violations that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Underwriting Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement and the Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Underwritten Securities as described under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Agreements and Instruments, nor will such action result in any violation of (a) the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations.

(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Underwriter, in contravention of a requirement of this Underwriting Agreement or applicable law, sold Securities to a person to whom such Underwriter failed to send or give, at or prior to the Closing Date, a copy of the Final Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented if (1) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof, in accordance with Section 3(d) of this Underwriting Agreement at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time, to the Underwriters and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Underwriter resulted from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Final Prospectus as, if applicable, amended or supplemented prior to the Closing Date and such Final Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person and (2) such failure to give or send such Final Prospectus by the Closing Date to the party or parties asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense.
provided
however
 
(b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of Company
, Directors and Officers
 
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action;
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.

The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.

The Representatives may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Underwritten Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof, a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the

Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
(a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Original Issue Date: November 6, 2003
Interest Payment Dates: May 15 and November 15
Maturity Date: November 15, 2010
Interest Rate: 4.75%
 
AUTOZONE, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS (the "Principal Amount") on the Maturity Date shown above, except as provided below, and to pay interest thereon at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on May 15, 2004. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Original Issue Date shown above. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or the November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authorized and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "4.75% Senior Notes due 2010" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
 
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
 
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 0.15%.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Quotation Agent" means Banc of America Securities LLC or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC or another Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Banc of America Securities LLC and its successors and any other primary treasury dealer the Company shall select; , that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary treasury dealer in New York City, the Company shall substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer.
provided, however
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
 
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
 
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
provided, however
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the
 
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
 
Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
 
The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
 
THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication has been executed by manual signature of the Trustee, this Note shall not be valid.

Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authorized and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "5.50% Senior Notes due 2015" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
 
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
 
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 0.20%.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Quotation Agent" means Banc of America Securities LLC or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC or another Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Banc of America Securities LLC and its successors and any other primary treasury dealer the Company shall select; , that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary treasury dealer in New York City, the Company shall substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer.
provided, however
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
 
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
 
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
provided, however
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the
 
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
 
Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
 
The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
 
THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication has been executed by manual signature of the Trustee, this Note shall not be valid.

Exhibit 99.1
News:
For immediate release
Memphis, Tenn. (September 21, 2004)  AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.836 billion for its fourth fiscal quarter (16 weeks) ended August 28, 2004, an increase of 0.3% from fiscal 2003. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, decreased 3% for the quarter. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 1.6 percentage points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased by 1.5 percentage points. This resulted in an operating margin of 19.8%, up 0.1 percentage points from last year. Operating profit increased 1.0% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter increased by 0.9% over the same period last year to $209 million, and diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the company share repurchase program, increased 11.2% to $2.53 per share from $2.27 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to 25.1% from 23.4% the previous year.
For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2004, sales were $5.637 billion, an increase of 3.3% from the prior year, while same store sales were flat. Operating profit increased 8.8% on an operating margin of 17.7%. Year-to-date net income increased 9.4% to $566 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 22.8% to $6.56 from $5.34.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock for $318 million during the fourth quarter. During the fiscal year ended August 28, 2004 share repurchases totaled $848 million, or 10.2 million shares at an average price of $83.20 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.2% while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.4%. AutoZone has adopted the accounting required by the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor" (EITF Issue 02-16), effective January 1, 2003. As a result, both this year's and last year's fourth quarters were affected by this change in classification. For the sixteen weeks ended August 28, 2004 and August 30, 2003, this resulted in a change in classification of vendor funding from operating expenses to cost of goods sold of $52.7 million and $37.0 million, respectively. Additionally, during this year's fourth quarter the Company experienced a gain from warranty negotiations of $15.5 million or $0.12 per share while last year's fourth quarter reflected a gain from warranty negotiations of $8.7 million or $0.06 per share as well as $4.6 million or $0.03 per share gain from the reversal of a restructuring reserve the Company established back in fiscal 2001 primarily for the closure of AutoZone stores. Excluding the impact of these events, gross margin for the quarter would have been 45.5% (versus 45.5% last year) and operating selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales would have been 26.5% (versus 26.1% last year). The opening of 84 new AutoZone stores and the Company's initiative to refresh 71 additional stores during the quarter contributed to the increase in operating selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.
The Company reduced its gross inventory levels (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned Pay On Scan inventory) per store as of August 28, 2004, to $448 thousand from $462 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, declined on
 
 
a per store level to $38 thousand from $46 thousand last year. As of August 28, 2004, the Company achieved $147 million in Pay On Scan inventory.
During the quarter ended August 28, 2004, AutoZone opened 77 new stores, closed 1 store, re-opened 7 stores under the AutoZone brand formerly operated as ABC Auto Parts, a regional auto parts chain, and replaced 2 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 3 new stores in Mexico. As of August 28, 2004, the Company had 3,420 domestic stores and 63 stores in Mexico. AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many domestic stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 8, 2004, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 20, 2004, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Dated: December 8, 2004

News:
For immediate release
Memphis, Tenn. (December 8, 2004)  AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.286 billion for its first fiscal quarter (12 weeks) ended November 20, 2004, up 0.3% over fiscal 2003. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, decreased 3% for the quarter. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 44 basis points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased by 40 basis points. This resulted in an operating margin of 16.8%, up 4 basis points from last year. Operating profit increased 0.6% over the prior year.
Net income, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter was up slightly over the same period last year to $123 million, and diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the company's share repurchase program, increased 12.7% to $1.52 per share from $1.35 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to 24.9% from 24.0% the previous year.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 0.4 million shares of its common stock for $30 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $84 per share. Since 1998, cumulative share repurchases have totaled $3.7 billion, or 82.6 million shares at an average price of $45 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 48.3% (versus 47.8% last year) while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.4% (versus 31.0% last year). However, both the prior year's gross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating profit, as a percentage of sales, benefited 125 basis points from a $16 million pre-tax benefit due to warranty negotiations. The opening of 28 new AutoZone stores along with higher utility and fuel costs contributed to the increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.
The Company's gross inventory levels (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned Pay On Scan inventory) per store as of November 20, 2004, were $464 thousand versus $459 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, declined on a per store level to $40 thousand from $44 thousand last year.
"Our business was challenged by the high gas prices this past quarter, as our customers continued to manage their expenditures closely and hold off on doing some preventative maintenance," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Our financial model is strong, however, and we have continued to increase earnings and operating cash flow while simultaneously improving our business model by removing risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and warranty liability. This consistency in cash flows will continue to be our ongoing focus, while we introduce many initiatives that, we believe, can help us grow same store sales over time."
During the quarter ended November 20, 2004, AutoZone opened 23 new stores, re-opened 5 stores under the AutoZone brand formerly operated as ABC Auto Parts, a regional auto parts chain, and replaced 1 store in the U.S. while additionally opening 1 new store in Mexico. As of November 20, 2004, the Company had 3,448 domestic stores and 64 stores in Mexico. AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive
parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many domestic stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     The information set forth under Item 2.03 below is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
     AutoZone has other commercial relationships with certain parties to the Credit Agreement described in Item 2.03. Fleet National Bank is the administrative agent, and several of the lenders are also lenders, under AutoZone's five-year and 364-day revolving credit facilities dated as of May 17, 2004. Additionally, from time to time, several of the lenders or their affiliates furnish general financing and banking services to AutoZone.
     On December 23, 2004, AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") entered into a Credit Agreement for a $300 million, 5-year term loan with Fleet National Bank ("Fleet") as administrative agent, Wachovia Bank, National Association as syndication agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions (including Fleet and Wachovia) as lenders, arranged by Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC as sole book manager and joint lead arranger and Banc of America Securities LLC as joint lead arranger.
     The term loan may consist of, at AutoZone's election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. Interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of Fleet's prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can range from 40 basis points to 112.5 basis points, depending upon AutoZone's senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt rating, as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. At AutoZone's current ratings, the applicable percentage on Eurodollar loans is 50 basis points. AutoZone has provided notice to the Administrative Agent of its intent to draw the full principal amount of $300 million as a Eurodollar loan, which pursuant to the Credit Agreement, will be funded on December 30, 2004, subject to the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement.
     AutoZone may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months for Eurodollar loans, subject to availability. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. AutoZone has the option to extend loans into subsequent interest period(s) or convert them into loans of another interest rate type. The entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2009, when the facility terminates.
     AutoZone may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar borrowings. If a change in control occurs, each lender has the right to require AutoZone to prepay its outstanding portion of the term loan, plus
Table of Contents
any accrued and unpaid fees and interest to the date of prepayment. Each lender must determine whether to require such prepayment during a 20-day period following notice from the Administrative Agent.
     The Credit Facility contains customary covenants for transactions of this type. The financial covenants include covenants that AutoZone will not permit the ratio of its "Consolidated Adjusted Funded Debt" to "Consolidated EBITDAR" to be greater than 3.00:1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter and will maintain a minimum ratio of "Consolidated EBITDAR" to "Consolidated Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rents" of 2.50:1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including cross defaults to other obligations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.
     AutoZone entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix the interest rate of the term loan at 4.55%.

(iii) Lenders electing to have their Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall so notify the Administrative Agent as directed in the Change of Control Notice; provided, however, that failure by any Lender to make a timely response shall be deemed to constitute an election by such Lender to terminate its Commitment and accept prepayment of its Loans. Upon the expiration date of the Change of Control Standstill Period, (A) all Lenders electing to terminate their Commitments (the "Terminating Lenders") shall surrender their Notes to the Administrative Agent at the address specified in Section 10.1 and (B) all Notes held by Terminating Lenders shall be cancelled by the Borrower and the Borrower shall pay the applicable Change of Control Prepayment Amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Terminating Lenders, and all other Obligations due to the Terminating Lenders under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents. (c) General. All prepayments made pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall (i) be subject to Section 3.11 and (ii) unless the Borrower shall specify otherwise, be applied first to Base Rate Loans, if any, and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. 3.4 [RESERVED]. 3.5 FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees referred to in the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter (collectively, the "Administrative Agent's Fees"). 3.6 CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Lender determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in - 19 -
the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Credit Agreement, its Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the Closing Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the Closing Date which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the Closing Date, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the Closing Date. 3.7 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (a) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans and (b) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or continued as Eurodollar Loans shall be converted to or continued as Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans. 3.8 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement, (a) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Base Rate Loan to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Base Rate Loan when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.11. - 20 -
3.9 YIELD PROTECTION. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance of any Lender therewith, (a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrower (excluding federal taxation of the overall net income of any Lender or applicable Lending Installation), or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender in respect of its Loans or other amounts due it hereunder; (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirements against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the Base Rate); and the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender of making, funding or maintaining loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender; then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Loans and its Commitments. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 3.10 WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION. Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall: (a) (i) on or before the date of any payment by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement or Notes to such Lender, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (A) two (2) duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to receive payments under this Credit Agreement and any Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax; (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two (2) further copies of any such form or - 21 -
certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and (iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent; or (b) in the case of any such Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (i) represent to the Borrower (for the benefit of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) that it is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) agree to furnish to the Borrower on or before the date of any payment by the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent two (2) accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8, or successor applicable form certifying to such Lender's legal entitlement at the date of such certificate to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the provisions of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement and any Notes (and to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two (2) further copies of such form on or before the date it expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recently provided form and, if necessary, obtain any extensions of time reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent for filing and completing such forms), and (iii) agree, to the extent legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the Borrower, to provide to the Borrower (for the benefit of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) such other forms as may be reasonably required in order to establish the legal entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from withholding with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement and any Notes; unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in either case. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to subsection 10.3 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this subsection, provided that in the case of a participant of a Lender the obligations of such participant of a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased. 3.11 INDEMNITY. The Borrower promises to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur (other than through such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct) as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a - 22 -
notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The covenants of the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.11 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 3.12 PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) Loans. Each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, each payment of interest on the Loans, and each conversion or extension of any Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans and Participation Interests. (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Closing Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Term Loan Commitment Percentage, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the Federal Funds Rate. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the Term Loan to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Term Loan Commitment - 23 -
Percentage. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (c) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to fund its Term Loan Commitment Percentage and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.5 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to fund its Term Loan Commitment Percentage or to make any payment under Section 10.5 on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so fund its Term Loan Commitment Percentage or to make its payment under Section 10.5. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 3.12 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 3.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall - 24 -
have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.13 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.13 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. 3.14 PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in dollars in immediately available funds, without offset, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 4:00 P.M. on the date when due. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent (with notice to the Borrower). The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of Section 3.12(a)). The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 12:00 Noon on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to computation of interest on Base - 25 -
Rate Loans which (unless the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Rate) shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment. (b) Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Loans, Fees or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent; THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to amounts owing to such Lender; FOURTH, to the payment of accrued fees and interest; FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Loans; SIXTH, to all other amounts and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category and (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above. 3.15 EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. - 26 -
Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.3(c) hereof, and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary. (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.15 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie, but not conclusive, evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof. 3.16 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. In the event any Lender delivers to the Borrower any notice in accordance with Sections 3.6, 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10, then the Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with one or more additional banks or financial institutions (collectively, the "Replacement Lender"), provided that (A) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 3.16, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more assignment agreements substantially in the form of Schedule 10.3(b) pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, Section 10.3(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 10.3(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the rights and obligations of the Replaced Lender hereunder and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (a) the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, and (b) all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.5(a), and (B) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (including all obligations, if any, owing pursuant to Section 3.6, 3.8 or 3.9, but excluding those obligations specifically described in clause (A) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. - 27 -

SECTION 5 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES The Borrower hereby represents to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that: 5.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. The audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of August 28, 2004 and the audited consolidated statements of earnings and statements of cash flows for the year ended August 28, 2004 have heretofore been furnished to each Lender. Such financial statements (including the notes thereto) (a) have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, (b) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and (c) present fairly (on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such financial statements) the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such periods.

(d) Bankruptcy, etc. Any Bankruptcy Event shall occur with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or (e) Other Indebtedness. With respect to any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness outstanding under this Credit Agreement or owing to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) in excess of $35,000,000 in the aggregate for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall (A) default in any payment (beyond the applicable grace period with respect thereto, if any) with respect to any such Indebtedness, or (B) default in the observance or performance relating to such Indebtedness or contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event or condition shall occur or condition exist, the effect of which default or other event or condition is to cause, or permit, the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or trustee or agent on behalf of such holders) to cause, any such Indebtedness to become due prior to the applicable maturity date, but after the expiration of all applicable grace periods, and such Indebtedness shall not be repaid when due; or (ii) any such Indebtedness shall be declared due and payable, or required to be prepaid other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment, prior to the stated maturity thereof and shall not be repaid when due; or (f) Judgments.

Any of the following events or conditions, if such event or condition reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (1) any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any lien shall arise on the assets of the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate in favor of the PBGC or a Plan; (2) an ERISA Event shall occur with respect to a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, likely to result in the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA; (3) an ERISA Event shall occur with respect to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, likely to result in (i) the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any liability in connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency or (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA) such Plan; or (4) any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility shall occur which may subject the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability - 44 -
under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any person against any such liability. 8.2 ACCELERATION; REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of Default has been waived by the Required Lenders or cured to the satisfaction of the Required Lenders (pursuant to the voting procedures in Section 10.6), the Administrative Agent shall, upon the request and direction of the Required Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower take any of the following actions: (a) Termination of Term Loan Commitments.

(c) Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and interests created and existing under the Credit Documents and all rights of set-off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section 8.1(d) shall occur, then all Loans, all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued and unpaid Fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder in respect thereof automatically shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders. SECTION 9 AGENCY PROVISIONS 9.1 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORITY. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Fleet (and Fleet hereby accepts such appointment) to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (in accordance with the role established for the Administrative Agent in this Credit Agreement and such other Credit Documents) and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative - 45 -
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Section are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. 9.2 RIGHTS AS A LENDER. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 9.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Credit Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable law; and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent - 46 -
shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 4 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 9.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent with reasonable care). The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lenders as the owner of their respective interests hereunder for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 10.3(b) hereof. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or to the extent specifically provided in Section 10.6, all the Lenders) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders (including their successors and assigns). In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. 9.5 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such - 47 -
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 9.6 RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may at any time resign upon 20 days' written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States; provided that, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor Administrative Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section and (3) the retiring Administrative Agent will provide to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonable access to the Register and/or copies of each Lender's Administrative Questionnaire. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Section and Section 10.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 9.7 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, - 48 -
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 9.8 NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Book Managers, Arrangers or other titles listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. 9.9 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 3.5 and 10.5) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 3.5 and 10.5. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or - 49 -
to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. SECTION 10 MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 NOTICES; EFFECTIVENESS; ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION.

Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Section 2 if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Section by electronic communication.

applicable, to be authentic even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower (but excluding any such losses, costs, expenses and liabilities that (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Related Party or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or such Related Party for breach in bad faith of such party's obligations hereunder or under any other Credit Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 10.2 RIGHT OF SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind (all of which rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation, branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against obligations and liabilities of such Person to such Lender hereunder, under the Notes or the other Credit Documents, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Lender subsequent thereto. Any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans and Commitments hereunder pursuant to Section 3.13 or Section 10.3(d) may exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as fully as if such Person were a Lender hereunder. 10.3 BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT. (a) Generally. This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its interests without prior written consent of the Lenders other than in connection with a Reorganization permitted by Section 7.3 hereof; provided further that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth in this Section 10.3, provided however that nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from (i) pledging its Loans hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank, or (ii) granting assignments or - 52 -
selling participations in such Lender's Loans and/or Commitments hereunder to its parent company and/or to any Affiliate or Subsidiary of such Lender. (b) Assignments. Each Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder, pursuant to an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 10.3(b), to (i) any Lender or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of a Lender, or (ii) any other commercial bank, financial institution or "accredited investor" (as defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission) that is reasonably acceptable to both the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower, with each such consent to be evidenced in writing; provided that any such assignment (other than any assignment to an existing Lender) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Loans being assigned by such Lender) and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 above such amount. Any assignment hereunder shall be effective upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of written notice of the assignment together with a transfer fee of $3,500 payable to the Administrative Agent for its own account (unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent) from and after the later of (i) the effective date specified in the applicable assignment agreement and (ii) the date of recording of such assignment in the Register pursuant to the terms of subsection (c) below. The assigning Lender will give prompt notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any such assignment. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment (and after notice to, and (to the extent required pursuant to the terms hereof), with the consent of, the Borrower as provided herein), the assignee shall become a "Lender" for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and, to the extent of such assignment, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of the Loans and Commitment components being assigned. Along such lines the Borrower agrees that upon (i) notice of any such assignment to a new Lender and (ii) the request of such new Lender, it will promptly execute and deliver to such new Lender a Note substantially in the form of Schedule 2.1(e). In the event a Lender assigns the entire amount of such Lender's Loans, such assigning Lender agrees to surrender its Note, if any, to the Borrower. By executing and delivering an assignment agreement in accordance with this Section 10.3(b), the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim; (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such assignment agreement; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of - 53 -
this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such assignment agreement; (v) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender. If the assignee is not a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a valid certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 3.10. (c) Maintenance of Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in Boston, Massachusetts (i) a copy of each Lender assignment agreement delivered to it in accordance with the terms of subsection (b) above and (ii) a register for the recordation of the identity of the principal amount, type and Interest Period of each Loan outstanding hereunder, the names, addresses and the Commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the Register and to promptly update the Register from time to time, as necessary. The Register shall be prima facie, but not conclusive, evidence of the information contained therein and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and each Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Participations. Each Lender may sell, transfer, grant or assign participations in all or any part of such Lender's interests and obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Lender shall remain a "Lender" for all purposes under this Credit Agreement (such selling Lender's obligations under the Credit Documents remaining unchanged) and the participant shall not constitute a Lender hereunder, (ii) no such participant shall have, or be granted, rights to approve any amendment or waiver relating to this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents except to the extent any such amendment or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or Fees in respect of any Loans in which the participant is participating or (B) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal (including extension of the Termination Date or the date of any mandatory prepayment), interest or Fees in which the participant is participating, and (iii) sub-participations by the participant (except to an affiliate, parent company or affiliate of a parent company of the participant) shall be prohibited. In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights against the selling Lender in respect of such participation to be those set - 54 -
forth in the participation agreement with such Lender creating such participation) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, provided, however, that such participant shall be entitled to receive additional amounts under Sections 3.6, 3.9 and 3.11 on the same basis as if it were a Lender provided that it shall not be entitled to receive any more than the selling Lender would have received had it not sold the participation. (e) Designation. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Designating Lender") may grant to one or more special purpose funding vehicles (each, an "SPV"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Designating Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Designating Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that (I) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan, (II) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Designating Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (III) the Designating Lender shall remain liable for any indemnity or other payment obligation with respect to its Commitment hereunder and (IV) each such SPV would satisfy the requirements of Section 3.10 if such SPV was a Lender hereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Designating Lender. (ii) As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each SPV shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Credit Agreement; provided, however that each SPV shall have granted to its Designating Lender an irrevocable power of attorney, to deliver and receive all communications and notices under this Credit Agreement (and any related documents) and to exercise on such SPV's behalf, all of such SPV's voting rights under this Credit Agreement. No additional Note shall be required to evidence the Loans or portion thereof made by an SPV; and the related Designating Lender shall be deemed to hold its Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the Loans or portion thereof funded by such SPV. In addition, any payments for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Designating Lender as agent for such SPV. (iii) Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Designating Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding prior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any - 55 -
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.

This Section 10.3 may not be amended without the written consent of any Designating Lender affected thereby. 10.4 NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Administrative Agent or any Lender and the Borrower shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 10.5 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES, ETC. The Borrower agrees to: (a) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (i) of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers (and their respective Affiliates) in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery and administration of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein (including, subject to any agreed upon limitations, the reasonable fees and expenses of Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, special counsel to the Administrative Agent and non-duplicative allocated costs of internal counsel) and any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto and thereto including, but not limited to, any such amendments, waivers or consents resulting from or related to any work-out, renegotiation or restructure relating to the performance by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement and (ii) of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (and their respective Affiliates) in connection with enforcement of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein (including, without limitation, in connection with any such enforcement, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including non-duplicative allocated costs of internal counsel) for the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders); (b) pay and hold each of the Lenders harmless - 56 -

As used in this Section 10.15, the term "employee benefit plan" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 3(3) of ERISA. 10.16 CONFLICT.

SCHEDULE 4.1(f) FORM OF LEGAL OPINION December 23, 2004 Fleet National Bank, as Administrative Agent for the Lenders 1633 Broadway, 28th Floor NY5-526-28-01 New York, NY 10019 Attn: Agency Services RE: AutoZone, Inc. Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am the Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("AutoZone"), and am familiar with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 among AutoZone, Inc., as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, Fleet National Bank, as Administrative Agent, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agent ("Credit Agreement"). Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in this opinion which are specifically defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement. In connection with the opinions expressed below, I have examined, or caused to be examined, the Credit Documents. I have relied upon the representations and warranties contained in each of such documents and upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, documents and other instruments as in my judgment are relevant to rendering the opinions expressed below. As to all matters of fact covered by such documents, I have relied, without independent investigation or verification on such documents. In such examination, I have assumed that each of the parties to the Credit Agreement, other than AutoZone, had and has, as the case may be, full power, authority and legal right to enter into each Credit Document to which it is a party and that each such Credit Document was or has been, as the case may be, duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of such parties. Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that: (i) Each of AutoZone and its subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation or limited partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with corporate or partnership, as the case may be, power and authority to own its properties and conduct its ordinary course of business;
(ii) Each of AutoZone and its subsidiaries has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation or limited partnership, as the case may be, for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction; (iii) Each of the Credit Documents to which AutoZone is a party, was or has been, as the case may be, duly authorized, executed and delivered by AutoZone and together constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of AutoZone enforceable against AutoZone in accordance with its and their terms. The opinions expressed in paragraph (iii) above are based upon the assumption for purposes of such opinions and without independent analysis that notwithstanding the respective choice of law clauses in the Credit Documents, the governing law with respect to each of the Credit Documents is identical in all relevant respects to the law of the State of Tennessee. Insofar as such opinion relates to the enforceability of any instrument, such enforceability is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The enforceability of the remedies provided under the Credit Agreement may also be limited by applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided therein but which do not in my opinion affect the validity of the Credit Agreement or make such remedies inadequate for the practical realization of the benefits intended to be provided. I do not express any opinion as to matters governed by any law other than the Federal laws of the United States of America, the corporation law of the State of Nevada and the laws of the State of Tennessee. Further, I express no opinion as to the enforceability of the choice of law provisions contained in any of the Credit Documents. This opinion is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described above. This opinion may not be used or relied upon by any other person, and may not be disclosed, quoted, filed with a governmental agency or otherwise referred to without my prior written consent except to your bank examiners, auditors and counsel and to prospective transferees of your interests under the Credit Documents and their professional advisers, or as required by law or pursuant to legal process. Very truly yours, Harry L. Goldsmith
SCHEDULE 5.5 MATERIAL LITIGATION AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone" or the "Company") is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by approximately 159 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers, against 18 defendants, five of which are principally automotive afterparts retailers and 13 of which are principally afterparts manufacturers. The plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the automotive afterparts retailer defendants have conspired with the afterparts manufacturer defendants to receive benefits such as volume discounts, rebates, early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without payment, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act (collectively, the "Acts"). Additionally, a subset of plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive afterparts retailer defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute, as well as the underlying claims, was decided in favor of AutoZone and the other automotive afterparts retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant to a unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit. In the current litigation, Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages (including statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the afterparts retailer defendants from inducing and/or knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the afterparts manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the Acts. The Company believes this suit to be without merit and will vigorously defend against it. The Company currently, and from time to time, is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 2, 2005, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 12, 2005, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

       
Exhibit 99.1
For immediate release
News:
Memphis, Tenn. (March 2, 2005) - AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.204 billion for its fiscal second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 12, 2005, up 3.9% over fiscal second quarter 2004. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, were flat for the quarter. Operating profit increased 12.2% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter increased by 30.4% over the same period last year to $119.5 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $1.48 per share from $1.04 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to an historic high of 25.4% from 24.5% the previous year.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 48.4% (versus 48.7% last year) while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 32.7% (versus 34.1% last year). The slight reduction in gross margin largely was due to one-time expenses related to the closure of one distribution center and the opening of a new facility near Dallas, Texas. The reduction in operating expenses has continued to be driven by a focused effort to reduce expenditures throughout all levels of the organization.
Additionally, the fiscal second quarter ended February 12, 2005 contained a one-time tax benefit adjustment of $15.3 million. Excluding these credits, earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $1.29 versus the year-ago quarter.
The Company's gross per store inventory levels (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned Pay On Scan inventory) as of February 12, 2005, were $450 thousand versus $443 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, increased on a per store level to $86 thousand from $74 thousand last year. The increase in inventory levels is attributable to the Company's efforts to invest in having the right part at the right price to further enhance our industry-leading brand in the eyes of our customers.
"Business strengthened considerably this quarter versus the past two quarters as gas prices fell from highs last year. We continue to implement new initiatives to grow sales profitably. We are also excited by our newest plan to expand into Puerto Rico," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. As part of its plan to open approximately 200 stores in fiscal year 2005, the Company will enter the Puerto Rico marketplace for the first time this year. The Company expects to open 10 stores by fall of 2005.
During the quarter ended February 12, 2005, AutoZone opened 27 new stores, replaced 1 store, and closed 1 store in the U.S. while additionally opening 3 new stores in Mexico. As of February 12, 2005, the Company had 3,474 domestic stores and 67 stores in Mexico.
Based upon recent SEC clarification, the Company is reviewing its accounting for leases and related leasehold improvements. While the impact on fiscal 2005 is estimated to be less than $1 million (net of tax), the Company expects to record a one-time charge for the cumulative non-cash adjustment in the
second quarter. The charge, which is not reflected in the attached results, is currently estimated to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million (net of tax).
AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many domestic stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call this morning, Wednesday, March 2, 2005, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss the second quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls". The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (402) 220-4124 through Wednesday, March 9, 2005, at 11:59 p.m. (EST).

This information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

        On April 5, 2005, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") notified Fleet National Bank, Administrative Agent under the Company's 5-Year Credit Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement (each as hereinafter defined), that, as permitted under such agreements, the Company is requesting the Lenders to extend the termination date of the 364-Day Credit Agreement for an additional period of 364 days, to May 15, 2006, and to extend the termination date of the 5-Year Credit Agreement for an additional period of one year, to May 17, 2010.
        The 5-Year Credit Agreement is that Amended and Restated 5-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 17, 2004, among AutoZone, Inc., as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Fleet National Bank as Administrative Agent. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is that Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of May 17, 2004, among AutoZone, Inc., as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Fleet National Bank as Administrative Agent.

Each Lender, in its sole discretion, will make a determination not more than 30 days nor less than 25 days prior to such termination date as to whether or not it will agree to extend the termination date as requested. If one or more Lenders fail to agree to the requested extension (the "Disapproving Lenders"), then the Company may elect to either (A) continue the credit facility at the same level of commitments by replacing each of the Disapproving Lenders in accordance with the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, or (B) provided that the requested extension is approved by Lenders holding more than 50% of the commitments under the 364-Day Credit Agreement (including any replacement lenders that replace a Disapproving Lender, the "Approving Lenders"), extend and continue the credit facility at a lower aggregate amount equal to the commitments held by the Approving Lenders. The termination date relating to the commitments held by any Disapproving Lenders (other than those who were replaced) will remain as now in effect, and the termination date relating to the commitments held by the Approving Lenders will be extended by an additional period of 364 days.

The termination date relating to the commitments held by any Disapproving Lenders (other than those who are replaced) will remain as now in effect, and the termination date relating to the commitments held by the Approving Lenders shall be extended by an additional period of one (1) year. The letter of credit obligations of any Disapproving Lenders whose commitments are terminated on the original termination date will automatically be allocated among the Approving Lenders and any applicable replacement lenders.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:

Exhibit 99.1
News:
For immediate release
Memphis, Tenn. (May 25, 2005)  AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.338 billion for its fiscal third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 7, 2005, down 1.6% from fiscal third quarter 2004. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, were down 5% for the quarter. Operating margin increased 91 basis points from last year to 19.4%, while operating profit increased 3.2% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter increased 3.1% over the same period last year to $147.8 million, and diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program, increased 10.5% to $1.86 per share from $1.68 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock for $278.6 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $87 per share. Since 1998 cumulative share repurchases have totaled $4.0 billion, or 85.8 million shares at an average price of $46 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 49.7% last year) while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.9% (versus 31.2% last year). The improvement in gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives as well as reduced sales of discretionary, lower margin, merchandise. The reduction in operating expenses has continued to be driven by a focused effort to reduce expenditures throughout the organization.
Last year's third quarter ended May 8, 2004, contained a $10.6 million non-recurring gain from warranty. Excluding last year's credit, operating profit increased 7.8% and diluted earnings per share increased 15.8% to $1.86 versus the year-ago quarter of $1.61.
The Company's gross per store inventory level (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory) as of May 7, 2005, was $458 thousand versus $447 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $59 thousand from $74 thousand last year reflecting an increase in accounts payable to 87.2% of inventory from 83.5% of inventory in the prior year. The increase in gross inventory levels reflects the Company's efforts to invest in the right part at the right place to further enhance its industry-leading brand in the eyes of its customers.
"I'd like to thank all our AutoZoners across the country for delivering another record quarter of EPS. However, sales were considerably weaker this quarter than expected. This shortfall has challenged us to take a fresh look at our opportunities for driving profitable sales. While we are encouraged by many of the new initiatives we've implemented, such as the expansion of our inventory coverage at the store level through Project Got It,' we will be doing more going forward to grow sales profitably. Our financial model continues to be strong. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively, while looking to leverage our industry-leading financial metrics," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 7, 2005, AutoZone opened 33 new stores, replaced 2 stores, and closed 2 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 6 new stores in Mexico. As of May 7, 2005, the Company had 3,505 domestic stores and 73 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many domestic stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call this morning, Wednesday, May 25, 2005, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss the third quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 21, 2005, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended August 27, 2005, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (c)       Exhibits             99.1     Press Release dated September 21, 2005
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 21, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported sales of $1.882 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 27, 2005, up 2.5% from fiscal fourth quarter 2004. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, were down 1% for the quarter. Operating margin decreased 116 basis points from last year to 18.7%, while operating profit decreased 3.5% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter decreased 1.3% over the same period last year to $206.6 million, while diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program, increased 5.4% to $2.66 per share from $2.53 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 48.7% (versus 49.2% last year). Last year's gross margin reflected $15.5 million of pre-tax gain from warranty credits. On a comparable basis, gross profit, for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, was 48.7% versus 48.3% last year. The improvement in comparable gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives as well as reduced sales of non-core, lower-margin, merchandise. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.0% (versus 29.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses reflected efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, from expanding hours of operation to ensuring stores were properly merchandised and well presented. Excluding last year's warranty credit, operating profit was up 0.8%.
Additionally, for this year's quarter there was a discrete income tax benefit of $6 million. Therefore, on a comparable basis, diluted earnings per share increased 7.3% to $2.59 versus the year-ago quarter of $2.41.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $118.3 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $93 per share. Since 1998 cumulative share repurchases have totaled $4.1 billion, or 87.0 million shares at an average price of $47 per share.
The Company's gross per store inventory level (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned pay-on-scan) as of August 27, 2005, was $453 thousand versus $448 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $34 thousand from $38 thousand last year reflecting an increase in accounts payable to 92.5% of inventory from 91.5% of inventory in the prior year. The increase in gross inventory levels reflects the Company's efforts to invest in the right part at the right place to further enhance its industry-leading brand in the eyes of its customers.
"Our operating margin this quarter reflects actions we took to improve the in-store customer experience. We increased training, placed additional focus on improving the appearance of our stores, and we intensified efforts to drive our unique and powerful culture. We are encouraged by our customers' and AutoZoners' initial response to these new initiatives. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively, while looking to leverage our industry-leading position," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 6, 2005 the Registrant issued a press release, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Exhibit 99.1.       Press release dated December 6, 2005
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 6, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported sales of $1.338 billion for its fiscal first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 19, 2005, up 4.0% from fiscal first quarter 2005. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, were up 1% for the quarter. Operating margin decreased 148 basis points from last year to 15.3%, while operating profit decreased 5.1% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter decreased 6.7% over the same period last year to $114.4 million, while diluted earnings per share declined 2.3% to $1.48 per share from $1.52 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.0% (versus 48.3% last year). The improvement in comparable gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives as well as reduced sales of non-core, lower-margin merchandise. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 31.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses reflects a $2.8 million hurricane related charge, and $3.7 million in share-based expenses resulting from the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments." On a comparable basis, adjusted operating expenses were 33.2% or 171 basis points over last year. The increase in comparable operating expenses reflected both short-term expenditures and longer-term efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, from expanding hours of operation to continuing to improve the in-store merchandising presentation.
Excluding this quarter's hurricane and share-based expenses, adjusted operating profit decreased 2.1%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1.2% to $1.54 versus the year-ago quarter of $1.52.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 123 thousand shares of its common stock for $9.8 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $80 per share. Since 1998 cumulative share repurchases have totaled $4.1 billion, or 87.2 million shares at an average price of $47 per share.
The Company's gross per store inventory level (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned pay-on-scan) as of November 19, 2005, was $455 thousand versus $464 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, increased on a per store level to $45 thousand from $40 thousand last year. AutoZone continues programs to provide excellent product availability while effectively financing appropriate inventory levels.
"Our quarter began back in September on a very unfortunate note," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Two hurricanes impacted our stores in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. In total, AutoZone had over 125 stores impacted in some form while over 160 AutoZoners were displaced from their homes following the storms. While our AutoZoners provided amazing support to get us back up and running, we unfortunately still have 13 locations closed due to the storms.
"During the quarter, we took specific actions to improve the customer shopping experience, and we are pleased with the initial response from our customers and AutoZoners. Our operating margin reflects the actions we took to improve the in-store customer experience. We increased training, placed additional focus on improving the appearance of our stores, and we intensified efforts to drive our unique and powerful culture. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings over the long term and utilizing our capital effectively, while striving to create the best shopping and working environment within the industry," continued Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 19, 2005, AutoZone opened 33 new stores and replaced 3 stores in the U.S. while opening 3 new stores in Mexico. Additionally, the Company has 13 U.S. stores still closed due to hurricane-related damage. As of November 19, 2005, the Company had 3,612 domestic stores and 84 stores in Mexico.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 1, 2006, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 11, 2006, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)  Exhibits        99.1 Press Release dated March 1, 2006
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 1, 2006 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported sales of $1.254 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 11, 2006, up 4.1% from fiscal second quarter 2005. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were up 0.4% for the quarter.
Operating margin for the quarter increased 187 basis points from last year to 14.2%, while operating profit increased 19.9% over the prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 3.1% over the same period last year to $97.0 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 7.6% to $1.25 per share from $1.16 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.1% (versus 48.4% last year). The improvement in comparable gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives as well as reduced sales of non-core, lower-margin merchandise. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.9% (versus 36.0% last year). On a comparable basis, adjusted operating expenses were 34.6% (versus 32.7% last year) or 192 basis points over last year. A portion of the increase in operating expenses this year reflected $4.2 million in share-based expenses resulting from the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments." The remaining increase in comparable operating expenses reflected both short-term expenditures to complete the remaining store resets underway during the first quarter and longer-term efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, from expanding hours of operation to continuing to improve the in-store mer chandising presentation.
Excluding this quarter's share-based expenses and last year's adjustments to both operating expenses and income taxes, adjusted operating profit decreased 3.4%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share were flat versus the year-ago quarter at $1.29.
The Company's total per store inventory level, including supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of February 11, 2006, was $494 thousand versus $484 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $79 thousand from $86 thousand last year. AutoZone continues to provide excellent product availability while effectively financing those inventory levels.
"The second quarter marked the completion of our store adjacencies initiative, and I would like to thank our AutoZoners for their amazing efforts," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer of AutoZone. "Additionally during the quarter, we continued our relentless focus on improving the customer shopping experience by increasing store-level training, improving our in-stock position, and continuing to focus on our unique and powerful culture to ensure we provide our customers with trustworthy advice.
"Over the past two quarters, we have deployed many new initiatives designed to deepen the relationship we have with our customers. Our operating margin reflects the impact of those initiatives. While some of them have been completed, many will be ongoing. We are pleased with our progress and believe we are well positioned as we enter our peak selling season," commented Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 11, 2006, AutoZone opened 41 new stores, replaced 4 stores, and closed 1 store in the U.S. while additionally opening 4 new stores in Mexico. Additionally, the Company re-opened 3 of 13 U.S. stores closed due to hurricane-related damage. As of February 11, 2006, the Company had 3,655 domestic stores and 88 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, adjusted rent expense, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating profit, adjusted income before taxes, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management manages the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the following tables. This is important information for the Company's manag ement of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; gasoline prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Fo rward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

     On May 5, 2006, AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") took the following actions:
     (1) entered into a new Four-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 5, 2006, among AutoZone as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America") as Administrative Agent, Citicorp USA, Inc. ("CUSA") as Syndication Agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions (including Bank of America and CUSA) as lenders, arranged by Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers (the "Four-Year Credit Facility");
     (2) terminated the Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of May 17, 2004, among AutoZone as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America as Administrative Agent and CUSA as Syndication Agent (the "364-Day Credit Facility"), which was scheduled to expire on May 15, 2006, and was replaced by the Four-Year Credit Facility;
     (3) amended and restated its Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 17, 2004, among AutoZone as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America as Administrative Agent and CUSA as Syndication Agent (as amended and restated, the "Restated Five-Year Credit Facility"); and
     (4) amended its Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004, among AutoZone as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of
Table of Contents
America as Administrative Agent and Wachovia Bank, National Association ("Wachovia") as Syndication Agent (the "Term Loan Facility").
     The Four-Year Credit Facility and the Restated Five-Year Credit Facility are collectively referred to herein as the "Credit Facilities."
     The aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facilities is $1,000,000,000; the principal amount of the Four-Year Credit Facility is $300 million, and the principal amount of the Restated Five-Year Credit Facility is $700 million. AutoZone may increase the aggregate size of the Credit Facilities to an amount not to exceed $1,300,000,000 provided certain conditions are met. The Credit Facilities include a $50 million sublimit for Swingline Loans (as defined below) and a $200 million sublimit for letters of credit.
     Both the Four Year Credit Facility and the Restated Five-Year Credit Facility will terminate, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable in full, on May 5, 2010 (the "Termination Date").
     Revolving loans under the Credit Facilities may consist of, at AutoZone's election, base rate loans, Eurodollar loans or a combination thereof. Interest accrues on base rate loans at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of Bank of America's prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage, which can range from 23 basis points to 70 basis points, depending upon AutoZone's senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt rating, as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. At AutoZone's current ratings, the applicable percentage on Eurodollar loans is 27 basis points.
     Certain revolving credit loans ("Swingline Loans") will be made available by the Swingline Lender, Bank of America, on a same-day basis in minimum amounts of $5 million, up to a limit of $50 million. AutoZone must repay each Swingline Loan in full upon the earliest of (a) the maturity date agreed to by AutoZone and the Swingline Lender (not more than seven business days from the date of advance), (b) the Termination Date, or (c) the demand of the Swingline Lender. Swingline Loans that are base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of Bank of America's prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. Quoted rate Swingline Loans accrue interest at the fixed percentage rate per annum offered by the Swingline Lender and accepted by AutoZone with respect to such Swingline Loan.
     A portion of the Restated Five-Year Credit Facility, not in excess of $200 million, will be available for the issuance of letters of credit. Letters of credit will be issued by SunTrust Bank, Bank of America, Wachovia or another lender acceptable to AutoZone and the Administrative Agent.
     Competitive loans under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at the fixed rate of interest offered by a lender for such competitive loan. Interest on competitive loans is
Table of Contents
payable in arrears on each applicable interest payment date as defined in the Credit Facilities or at such other times as may be specified.
     AutoZone may prepay loans under the Credit Facilities (other than competitive loans, which may not be prepaid) in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar loans and quoted rate Swingline Loans. If a change in control occurs, each lender has the right to require AutoZone to prepay such lender's outstanding portion of loans and cash collateralize such lender's letter of credit obligations, plus any accrued and unpaid fees and interest to the date of prepayment. Each lender must determine whether to require such prepayment during a 20-day period following notice from the Administrative Agent.
     The Credit Facilities contain customary covenants for transactions of this type. The financial covenants include covenants that AutoZone will not permit the ratio of its "Consolidated Adjusted Funded Debt" to "Consolidated EBITDAR" to be greater than 3.00:1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter and will maintain a minimum ratio of "Consolidated EBITDR" to "Consolidated Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rents" of 2.50:1.00. The Credit Facilities also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to other obligations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.
     The Term Loan Facility was amended to make certain defined terms and other provisions conform to corresponding terms and provisions contained in the Four-Year Credit Facility and the Restated Five-Year Credit Facility.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 24, 2006, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended May 6, 2006, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d) Exhibits      99.1    Press Release dated May 24, 2006.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 24, 2006 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported sales of $1.417 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 6, 2006, up 5.9% from fiscal third quarter 2005. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were up 2.1% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter decreased 2.3% over the same period last year to $144.4 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 1.4% to $1.89 per share from $1.86 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $228.3 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $98 per share. Since 1998 cumulative share repurchases have totaled $4.3 billion, or 89.5 million shares at an average price of $49 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.7% (versus 50.3% last year). The reduction in comparable gross margin was primarily due to a higher penetration of commodity and maintenance items versus last year, which typically have lower margins. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.8% (versus 30.9% last year). A portion of the increase in operating expenses this year reflected $4.2 million in share-based expenses resulting from the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments." Adjusting for this non-comparable expense item, operating expenses were 31.5% (versus 30.9% last year) or 61 basis points over last year. The increase in comparable operating expenses reflected both the Company's ongoing initiatives to improve the customer shopping experience, such as additional training and extended hours of operation, and higher occupancy costs versus last year.
Excluding this quarter's share-based charges, adjusted net income decreased 0.5%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.92 were up 3.3% versus the year-ago quarter.
The Company's total per store inventory level, including supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of May 6, 2006, was $495 thousand versus $497 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, increased on a per store level to $82 thousand from $59 thousand last year.
"We are pleased with the progress we are making on the major initiatives launched at the beginning of the year. These initiatives, which focus on improving the customer shopping experience, have resulted in improved sales and measurable increases in customer service metrics. I would like to thank all of our AutoZoners for their commitment to deliver exceptional service to our customers," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We will continue our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings over the long-term while effectively deploying capital."
During the quarter ended May 6, 2006, AutoZone opened 42 new stores and replaced 4 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 4 new stores in Mexico. Additionally, the Company re-opened 2 U.S. stores closed due to hurricane-related damage. As of May 6, 2006, the Company had 3,699 domestic stores and 92 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a one-hour conference call this morning, Wednesday, May 24, 2006, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss the third quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-3495 through Tuesday, May 30, 2006, at 11:59 p.m. (EDT).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, adjusted rent expense, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating profit, adjusted income before taxes, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management manages the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. This is important information for the Company's manage ment of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; gasoline prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Fo rward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Each series of Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the Indenture. Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Securities through J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (together, the "Representatives"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives, the Company will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representatives and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Company (the "Underwriters," which term shall include the Representatives, whether acting as the only Underwriters or as members of an underwriting syndicate, as well as any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be initially issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter other than the Representatives acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities which each such Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed

The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The final prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at the time of the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus."

The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. 6
(viii) Good Standing of Subsidiaries.

Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. Such Underwritten Securities will be in the form contemplated by, and each registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of, the Indenture. (xii) Authorization of the Indenture. The Indenture has been, or prior to the issuance of the Securities thereunder will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (xiii) Descriptions of the Underwritten Securities and Indenture. The Underwritten Securities being sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and the Indenture, as of each Representation Date, conform in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus and are in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Underwriting Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement and the Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Company in 8
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Underwritten Securities as described under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Agreements and Instruments, nor will such action result in any violation of (a) the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations. As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder's behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than as stated therein), or which might reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the assets, properties or operations thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Prospectus, this Underwriting Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement or the Indenture, or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective assets, properties or operations is the subject which are not described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.

(xix) Title to Property. The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and good title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind, except (A) as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or (B) those which do not, singly or in the aggregate, materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

code, policy or rule of common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof including any judicial or administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of human health, the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), (B) the Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, authorizations and approvals required under any applicable Environmental Laws and are each in compliance with their requirements, (C) there are no pending or threatened, to the Company's knowledge, administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, demand letters, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (D) there are no events or circumstances that might reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or any Environmental Laws.

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries employ disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

The Registration Statement is not the subject of a pending proceeding or examination under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the 1933 Act, and the Company is not the subject of a pending proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Securities. (b) Officers' Certificates. Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and delivered to any Underwriter or to counsel to the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities and dated a Representation Date shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to each Underwriter as to the matters covered thereby on such Representation Date. SECTION 2. Sale and Delivery to Underwriters; Closing. (a) Underwritten Securities. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. (b) Payment. Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Underwritten Securities shall be made at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022 or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third (fourth, if the pricing occurs after 4:30 P.M. (New York City time) on any given day) business day after the date of the applicable Terms Agreement (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof), or such other time not later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called "Closing Time"). Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company, against delivery to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representatives, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Underwritten Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase. The Representatives, each individually and not as representatives of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder. (c) Denominations; Registration. The Underwritten Securities or certificates for the Underwritten Securities, as applicable, shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request in writing at least one full business day prior to the Closing Time.

City of New York not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the business day prior to the Closing Time. SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with the Representatives and with each Underwriter participating in the offering of Underwritten Securities, as follows: (a) Compliance with Securities Regulations and Commission Requests. The Company, subject to Section 3(b), will comply with the requirements of Rule 430B of the 1933 Act Regulations and will notify the Representative(s) immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Underwritten Securities or the filing of any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus, (ii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iii) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the 1933 Act concerning the Registration Statement and (v) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities. The Company will promptly effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. (b) Filing of Amendments and Exchange Act Documents; Preparation of Final Term Sheet. The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations) or any new registration statement relating to the Underwritten Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Original Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. The Company has given the Representatives notice of any filings made pursuant to the 1934 Act or 1934 Act Regulations within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") 13
reflecting the final terms of the Underwritten Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives and substantially in the form of Annex I to the Terms Agreement, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two business days after the date of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. To the extent the distribution of Underwritten Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representatives with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act. (c) Delivery of Registration Statements. The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representatives, without charge, a conformed copy of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters. The Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (d) Delivery of Prospectuses. The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (e) Continued Compliance with Securities Laws. The Company will comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Underwritten Securities as contemplated in this Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside 14
counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement, to file a new registration statement, or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, (ii) use its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities), and (iii) furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Underwritten Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission. (f) Blue Sky Qualifications. The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Underwritten Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Underwritten Securities have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of such Terms Agreement. (g) Earnings Statement. The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act. (h) Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Underwritten Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds". (i) Listing. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Underwritten Securities, prior to the Closing Time, on any national securities exchange or quotation system if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. 15
(j) Restriction on Sale of Securities. Between the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and the Closing Time or such other date specified in such Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer or contract to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, the securities specified in such Terms Agreement. (k) Reporting Requirements. The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (l) Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses. The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Underwritten Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Underwritten Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping. SECTION 4. Payment of Expenses. (a) Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the preparation, printing and delivery to the Underwriters of this Underwriting Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Agreement among Underwriters, the Indenture and such other documents as may be required in connection with the offering, purchase, sale, issuance or delivery of the Underwritten Securities, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Underwritten Securities and any certificates for the Underwritten Securities, as applicable, to the Underwriters, including any transfer taxes and any stamp or other duties payable upon the sale, issuance or delivery of the Underwritten Securities to the Underwriters, (iv) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, accountants and other advisors or agents (including transfer agents and registrars), as well as the fees and disbursements of the Trustee, and their respective counsel, (v) the qualification of the Underwritten Securities under state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation, printing and delivery of the Blue Sky Survey, and any amendment thereto, (vi) the 16
printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of each preliminary prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto and any costs associated with electronic delivery of any of the foregoing by the Underwriters to investors, (vii) the fees charged by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for the rating of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, (viii) the fees and expenses incurred with respect to the listing of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, (ix) the filing fees incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters in connection with, the review, if any, by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") of the terms of the sale of the Underwritten Securities, (x) the fees and expenses of any Underwriter acting in the capacity of a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in Section 20) of Schedule E of the bylaws of the NASD), if applicable and (xi) the costs and expenses (including without limitation any damages or other amounts payable in connection with legal or contractual liability) associated with the reforming of any contracts for sale of the Underwritten Securities made by the Underwriters caused by a breach of the representation contained in the fifth paragraph of Section 1(a)(ii). Except as set forth in clauses (v) and (ix) of this Section 4(a) or upon termination of this Underwriting Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or 9(b)(i) or 9(b)(iii) (only with respect to the Company's securities), the Company shall not be obligated to pay any fees or disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters. (b) Termination of Agreement. If the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated by the Representatives in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or 9(b)(i) or 9(b)(iii) (only with respect to the Company's securities), hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters. SECTION 5. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 hereof or in certificates of any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement; Filing of Prospectus.

In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States, upon the opinions of counsel satisfactory to the Representatives. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.

SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification of Underwriters. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or 19
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (b) Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. (c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an 20
indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the 21
Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the 22
Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities. SECTION 9. Termination. (a) Underwriting Agreement.

SECTION 10. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

(Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on December 15, 2006. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Original Issue Date shown above. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on
the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the June 1 or the December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner. This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authorized and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "6.95% Senior Notes due 2016" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes. The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted
to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 35 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations. "Quotation Agent" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or another Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary treasury dealers the Company shall select. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary treasury dealer in New York City, the Company shall substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption. The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund. In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository. Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture. The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability. THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF. All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. Unless the certificate of authentication has been executed by manual signature of the Trustee, this Note shall not be valid.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 19, 2006, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended August 26, 2006, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)      Exhibits
99.1   Press release dated September 19, 2006
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 19, 2006 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.939 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 26, 2006, up 3.0% from fiscal fourth quarter 2005. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were down 0.9% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 3.3% over the same period last year to $213.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 9.6% to $2.92 per share from $2.66 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.7 million shares of its common stock for $340.0 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $91 per share. For the fiscal year ended August 26, 2006 AutoZone repurchased 6.2 million shares of its common stock for $578.1 million, at an average price of $93 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.7% (versus 48.7% last year). The Company's improvement in gross margin has largely been due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives which include management of procurement costs, continued optimization of merchandise assortment, and an ongoing focus on direct importing initiatives. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.4% (versus 30.0% last year). A portion of the increase in operating expenses this year reflected $5.2 million in share-based expenses resulting from the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments." Excluding this non-comparable expense item, adjusted operating expenses were 30.1% (versus 30.0% last year) or 12 basis points over last year. Higher occupancy costs versus last year contributed to the increase in comparable operating expenses.
Excluding this quarter's share-based charges and last year's discrete tax benefit, adjusted net income increased 8.1%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.96 were up 14.6% versus the year-ago quarter.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store level, including supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of August 26, 2006, was $501 thousand versus $494 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, increased on a per store level to $38 thousand from $34 thousand last year.
"While we are pleased with this past quarter's bottom line results, and we are encouraged with the progress we are making on the major initiatives launched at the beginning of the year, we were not satisfied with this quarter's sales performance. Our ongoing initiatives, which focus on improving the customer shopping experience, resulted in measurable increases in customer service metrics throughout the year. While the financial burdens faced by our customers have been well-documented by many retailers, we continue to believe there are many opportunities to further improve our sales performance for the future," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended August 26, 2006, AutoZone opened 69 new stores, closed 1 store, and replaced 7 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 8 new stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, adjusted rent expense, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating profit, adjusted income before taxes, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management manages the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. This is important information for the Company's management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Forw ard-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 5, 2006, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 18, 2006, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d) Exhibits 99.1 Press Release dated December 5, 2006.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 5, 2006 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.393 billion for its first fiscal quarter (12 weeks) ended November 18, 2006, up 4.1% from fiscal first quarter 2006. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were up 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 8.3% over the same period last year to $123.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 16.4% to $1.73 per share from $1.48 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.2% (versus 49.0% last year). The Company's improvement in gross margin has largely been due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives which include continued optimization of merchandise assortment and pricing, and an increasing focus on direct importing initiatives. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.2% (versus 33.6% last year). A substantial portion of the favorable variance in operating expenses reflects a $2.8 million hurricane related charge taken in last year's quarter, our store reset efforts initiated in last year's first quarter, and an ongoing focus to reduce expenditures throughout the organization.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 816 thousand shares of its common stock for $90.8 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $111 per share. The Company has approximately $130 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, including supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of November 18, 2006, was $503 thousand versus $495 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, increased on a per store level to $60 thousand from $45 thousand last year.
"I'd like to thank our AutoZoners across the country for delivering record first quarter sales and EPS. While we're continuing to build momentum with our ongoing efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, driving measurable increases in customer service metrics, resulting sales improvements have been slower to materialize. As our financial model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively. Additionally, we believe our focus on driving our unique and powerful culture and refining our merchandise assortment during fiscal 2007 will positively impact sales for the foreseeable future," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 18, 2006, AutoZone opened 40 new stores and replaced 5 stores in the U.S. Additionally, the Company re-opened 1 of the remaining 4 U.S. stores closed due to hurricane-related damage in last year's first quarter. As of November 18, 2006, the Company had 3,812 stores in 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 100 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include total inventory, total inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, adjusted rent expense. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management manages the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. This is important information for the Company's management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying rec onciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Forw ard-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Release.
(It is important that you read and understand the terms of this Agreement in full and that if you decide to sign it, that you do so knowingly and voluntarily. We suggest you consult an attorney about this Agreement and your rights before signing it. You will not waive or give up any rights to claims you may have against AutoZone that may arise after the date that you sign this Agreement.

In the event of breach by Employee of any provision of the Non-Compete section, Employee acknowledges that such breach will cause irreparable damage to AutoZone, the exact amount of which will be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that remedies at law for any such breach will be inadequate. Accordingly, AutoZone shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights or remedies existing in its favor, to obtain, without the necessity for any bond or other security, specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce, or prevent breach of any such provision and AutoZone shall be entitled to the remedies set forth in the section entitled "Remedies".

     7.  This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters covered herein and integrates and merges all prior understandings, discussions and negotiations.

     8.  The sections of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If any section or provision of this Agreement shall be held to be unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, or if such modification is not possible, then this Agreement shall be construed as though such section or provision had not been included. If any section or provision of this Agreement shall be subject to two constructions, one of which would render such section or provision invalid, then such section or provision shall be given that construction that would render it valid.
Severability.
     9.

Press Release dated February 27, 2007

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 27, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.300 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 10, 2007, up 3.7% from fiscal second quarter 2006. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were down 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 6.2% over the same period last year to $103.0 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.5% to $1.45 per share from $1.25 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.2% (versus 49.1% last year). We experienced improvements in leveraging product acquisition costs offset by a shift in sales mix toward lower margin, seasonally related product. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.6% (versus 34.9% last year). The favorable variance in operating expenses was primarily due to our store reset efforts in last year's second quarter and an ongoing focus to reduce expenditures throughout the organization.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for $128.9 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $123 per share. The Company virtually completed its remaining capacity under its previous share repurchase authorization, and today announces it has received approval from its Board of Directors to purchase an additional $500 million to take its cumulative repurchase program, begun in 1998, to $5.4 billion.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of February 10, 2007, was $496 thousand versus $494 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $63 thousand from $79 thousand last year.
"I'd like to congratulate our AutoZoners across the country for delivering record second quarter net income and earnings per share results. Although overall sales performance has been below our expectations, we were successful in leveraging our operating model to deliver 15.5% growth in earnings per share. We believe we are taking appropriate actions to improve our overall sales performance. We are pleased with the progress we have made regarding our new merchandise assortment initiatives and believe we are well positioned heading into our busiest selling season.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted rent expense. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer trans portation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 22, 2007, AutoZone, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended May 5, 2007, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)       Exhibits
99.1    Press Release dated May 22, 2007.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 22, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.474 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 5, 2007, an increase of 4.0% from fiscal third quarter 2006. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 0.4% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 5.0% over the same period last year to $151.6 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.0% to $2.17 per share from $1.89 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.9% (versus 49.7% last year). The improvement in gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives and a focus on driving supply chain efficiencies. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.9% (versus 31.8% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected higher occupancy costs versus last year.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock for $244.8 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $128 per share. For the fiscal year to date, the Company has repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $464.5 million, at an average price of $123 per share.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of May 5, 2007, was $504 thousand versus $495 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $73 thousand from $82 thousand last year.
"We continue to be pleased with our earnings performance, and are encouraged with the progress we are making on our major initiatives. While we experienced disappointing sales in the first half of April, we were pleased to deliver 15.0% growth in earnings per share for the quarter. As we enter our busiest selling season, we feel we are well positioned based on the progress we have made with our sales initiatives including improving merchandise assortment and implementation of Z-net, our updated electronic parts catalog. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 5, 2007, AutoZone opened 33 new stores and replaced five stores in the U.S. Additionally, the Company re-opened one of the remaining two U.S. stores closed due to hurricane-related damage in last year's first quarter. As of May 5, 2007, the Company had 3,881 stores in 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 110 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted rent expense. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Forw ard-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.

On September 18, 2007, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended August 25, 2007, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d) Exhibits       99.1 Press Release dated September 18, 2007.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 18, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.0 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 25, 2007, an increase of 3.3% from fiscal fourth quarter 2006. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.2% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 1.7% over the same period last year to $217.2 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 10.6% to $3.23 per share from $2.92 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.1% (versus 49.7% last year). The improvement in gross margin was due to ongoing category management efforts as well as supply chain efficiencies. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.3% (versus 30.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus last year.
For the fiscal year ended August 25, 2007, sales were $6.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 0.1%. Operating profit increased 4.5% on an operating margin of 17.1%. For fiscal 2007, net income increased 4.6% to $596 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 13.6% to $8.53 from $7.50.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $297.4 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $132 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock for $761.9 million, at an average price of $126 per share.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of August 25, 2007, was $500 thousand versus $501 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $34 thousand from $38 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report record sales and earnings for our fourth quarter. While we experienced less sales traction from our ongoing initiatives than we had expected, our marketing research continues to tell us our service levels are improving, and that our customers are more inclined to return to our stores for their next purchase. As we begin our new fiscal year, we believe we are well positioned to generate increased sales growth for both our Retail and Commercial businesses. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended August 25, 2007, AutoZone opened 53 new stores, replaced three stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened 13 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying recon ciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: September 28, 2007
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     AUTOZONE, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, by resolution of its Board of Directors on March 29, 1991, adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan was approved by the stockholders of the Company on March 29, 1991. The Plan was amended by the Board of Directors on June 18, 1991, to conform the Plan to amendments to the regulations related to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On December 21, 1991, the Plan was assumed by AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation, after its reincorporation. The Plan was amended by the Board of Directors on March 2, 1996, and October 21, 1996, to extend the expiration date of the Plan. On October 21, 1997, the Compensation Committee adopted the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was approved by the stockholders of the Company on December 18, 1997. On October 19, 1999, the Compensation Committee adopted the Second Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan to prohibit sales of shares purchased under the Plan for at least one year after the exercise of an option under the Plan. On December 12, 2002, the Board of Directors extended the termination date of the Plan to December 31, 2007. On September 26, 2007, the Board of Directors amended the Plan to (i) permit the Administrator to require Participants holding fewer than 20 uncertificated shares of Stock under the Plan as of the Participant's termination of employment (or shortly thereafter, in certain circumstances) who either fail to elect to receive certificated shares of Stock or who elect to receive cash in lieu of such shares of Stock, in either case, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, to accept a cash payment in lieu of such uncertificated shares upon (or shortly after) termination of employment, and (ii) extend the termination date of the Plan to December 31, 2017.
     The purposes of the Plan are as follows:
     (1) To assist employees of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company in acquiring a stock ownership interest in the Company pursuant to a plan which is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
     (2) To help employees provide for their future security and to encourage them to remain in the employment of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company.

.
          (iii) In the event the Company is required to obtain from any commission or agency authority to issue any such certificate, the Company will seek to obtain such authority. The inability of the Company to obtain from any such commission or agency authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance of any such certificate shall relieve the Company from liability to any Participant except to return the amount of the balance in the account in cash.
          (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant's employment with the Company terminates and (A) such Participant holds fewer than 20

The Committee may require the Participant to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares of stock acquired by exercise of an Option within two years from the date of granting such Option or one year after the transfer of such shares to such Participant.

     Section 4. When a quorum is present at any meeting, action of the stockholders on a matter other than the election of directors is approved if the number of votes cast in favor of the action exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the action, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, or the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-Laws, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders.
     Section 5. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy appointed in a reasonable manner as may be permitted by law, including, without limitation, a signed writing, telegram, facsimile, and electronic communication.

The directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of directors and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the voting power of the Corporation's stock may summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
     Section 3. The property and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-Laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
     Section 4. The directors may hold their meetings and have one or more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation outside of the State of Nevada.

     Section 7. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum, shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as
 
may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall constitute a quorum.
     Section 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.
     Section 9. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
     Section 10. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power in reference to amending the Articles of Incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the By-Laws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution, By-Laws, or the Articles of Incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power

     Section 12. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
     Section 13. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he either is not liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person is liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
     (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
 
interests of the Corporation. Indemnification shall not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.
     (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he must be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.
     (d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b), unless ordered by a court shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination shall be made (1) by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation's stock, (2) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding, (3) if a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the act, suit or proceeding so order, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) if a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
     (e) Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 13. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
     (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to the other paragraphs of this Section 13, (i) does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to paragraph (b) or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to paragraph (e), may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action; and (ii) continues for a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section 13 is not paid in full within ninety (90) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such
 
claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
     (g) The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of a majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors, the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 13.
     (h) The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation to enter into a contract with any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than those provided for in this Section 13.
     (i) For the purposes of this Section 13, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section with respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence had continued.
     (j) For purposes of this section, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this section.

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Nothing in this Section 5 shall require the Corporation to issue a new certificate if the
 
Corporation has determined that such shares of stock shall be uncertificated. Uncertificated shares shall be transferable only upon compliance with the customary procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form recorded electronically on a Direct Registration System.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
     Section 7. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Nevada.
     Section 1. Distributions upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.
     Section 2. Before payment of any distribution there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for distributions such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing distributions, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interests of the Corporation, and the directors may abolish any such reserve.
 
     Section 3. All checks or demands for money and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers, or such other persons, as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.
     Section 4. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
     Section 5. The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation and the words "Corporate Seal, Nevada". Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
     Section 6. Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these By-Laws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in any manner as may be permitted by law reasonably intended to give actual notice, to such address, physical or electronic, as appears on the records of the Corporation, with any required postage prepaid. Notice to any director may be by any reasonable means, including, without limitation, mail, personal delivery, facsimile, or electronic communication. All notices shall be deemed given when sent.
     Section 7. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these By-Laws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
     Section 1. Except as otherwise restricted in the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws:
     (a) Any provision of these By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed at the annual or any regular meeting of the Board of Directors without prior notice, or at any special meeting of the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration or repeal be contained in the notice of such special meeting.
     (b) These By-Laws may also be altered, amended or repealed at a duly convened meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Corporation's stock. The stockholders may provide by resolution that any
 
By-law provision repealed, amended, adopted or altered by them may not be repealed, amended, adopted or altered by the Board of Directors.
     I, Harry L. Goldsmith, hereby certify that the foregoing Fourth Amended and Restated By-Laws of AutoZone, Inc., were duly adopted at a meeting of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., on September 26, 2007.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 4, 2007, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 17, 2007, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)   Exhibits        99.1 Press Release dated December 4, 2007.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 4, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 17, 2007, an increase of 4.5% from fiscal first quarter 2007. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 1.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 7.0% over the same period last year to $132.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.02 per share from $1.73 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.9% (versus 49.2% last year). The improvement in gross margin was due to ongoing category management efforts as well as a shift in sales mix to higher margin categories. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 33.2% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus last year.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350.0 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $121 per share. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 8.9% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of November 17, 2007, was $507 thousand versus $503 thousand last year, an increase of less than 1%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $50 thousand from $60 thousand last year.
"We were pleased to report record sales and earnings performance for this quarter, as we continued to build momentum with our ongoing efforts to improve the customer shopping experience. With the support of all our AutoZoners, we were able to drive sales increases across each of our strategic priorities: Domestic Retail, Domestic Commercial, Mexico and ALLDATA. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 17, 2007, AutoZone opened 40 new stores, replaced three stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened one store in Mexico. As of November 17, 2007, the Company had 3,972 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 124 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a conference call this morning, Tuesday, December 4, 2007, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss the first quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-1211 through Tuesday, December 11, 2007 at 11:59 p.m. (EST).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases.

Item 1.01
.
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
     Effective January 1, 2008, the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") amended AutoZone's director compensation structure and, in connection therewith, amended and restated the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Compensation Plan (the "Director Compensation Plan") and the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Stock Option Plan (the "Director Stock Option Plan").
     Effective January 1, 2008, non-employee directors can choose each year between two compensation options. A director electing the first option will receive the same retainer fee as has previously been paid, i.e., an annual base retainer of $40,000 (the "Base Retainer"). A director electing the second option will receive, in addition to the Base Retainer, an annual supplemental retainer in the amount of $35,000 (the "Supplemental Retainer"), but will receive a smaller annual stock option award under the Director Stock Option Plan.
     The Base Retainer and the Supplemental Retainer, if applicable, plus any chairman fees are paid through the Director Compensation Plan, so that at least one-half of these fees are paid in common stock, and the director may elect to receive up to 100% of the fees in stock or to defer all or part of the fees in units with value equivalent to the value of shares of AutoZone common stock ("Stock Units").
     The Director Stock Option Plan was amended so that directors who elect to be paid only the Base Retainer receive, on January 1 during their first two years of service as a director, an option to purchase 3,000 shares of AutoZone common stock. After the first two years, such directors will receive, on January 1 of each year, an option to purchase 1,500 shares of common stock, and each such director who owns common stock or Stock Units worth at least five times the Base Retainer will receive an additional option to purchase 1,500 shares. Directors electing to be paid the Supplemental Retainer will receive, on January 1 during their first two years of service as a director, an option to purchase 2,000 shares of AutoZone common stock. After the first two years, such directors will receive, on January 1 of each year, an option to purchase 500 shares of common stock, and each such director who owns common stock or Stock Units worth at least five times the Base Retainer will receive an additional option to purchase 1,500 shares.
     The changes in the grants during a director's first two years of service will not apply to any director who was a member of the Board as of June 6, 2007.
     The AutoZone, Inc. Director Compensation Program, the AutoZone, Inc. Amended and Restated 2003 Director Compensation Plan, and the AutoZone, Inc. Amended and Restated 2003 Director Stock Option Plan are filed as exhibits to this current report on Form 8-K and are incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

The following exhibits are furnished with this Current Report:
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: January 4, 2008
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
     SECTION 1. PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM.
     The purpose of this document is to set forth the general terms and conditions applicable to the AutoZone, Inc. Director Compensation Program (the "Program") established by the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") pursuant to, and in implementation of, the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Compensation Plan (the "Compensation Plan") and the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan", and collectively, the "Plans"). The Program is intended to carry out the purposes of the Plans and provide a means to reinforce objectives for sustained long-term performance and value creation by providing each member of the Board of Directors who is not an employee or officer of the Company (the "Director") with compensation, subject to the restrictions and other provisions of the Program and the Plans. The Program shall be effective January 1, 2008 (the "Effective Date").
     SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.
     Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same definitions as such terms are defined in the Plans.
     SECTION 3. ELECTIONS.
     With respect to each fiscal year of the Plans, which shall be the 12-month period beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of each year (the "Plan Year"), each Director who was a Director during the prior Plan Year must elect by no later than December 31 of the Plan Year to receive his or her compensation for services performed for the following calendar year under the terms of subparagraph (a) or (b) below. Each Director who becomes a Director during a Plan Year must make such election for such calendar year within 30 days after becoming a Director. Each election must be made by the Director filing an election form with the Secretary of the Company. When an election is made for a Plan Year, the Director may not revoke or change that election with respect to such Plan Year. If a Director does not file an election form for each Plan Year by the specified date, the Director will be deemed to have elected the Option specified in his or her last valid election or, if there had been no prior election, will be deemed to have elected Option 1, and the Fee earned during the Plan Year under the Compensation Plan will be paid as 50 percent in shares of Common Stock and 50 percent in cash, and will not be eligible for deferral; provided that, any such deemed election shall be irrevocable as of the end of the prior Plan Year.
     A Director may elect to receive his or her compensation for each Plan Year in either of the following forms:
 
     (a) Option 1.

     SECTION 8. NO TRANSFER OF RIGHTS UNDER THE PROGRAM.
     Except as otherwise set forth under the terms of the Plans, a Director or former Director shall not have the right to transfer, grant any security interest in or otherwise encumber rights he or she may have under this Program.

     SECTION 4. ELECTIONS.
     With respect to each Plan Year, each Director who was a Director during the prior Plan Year must elect by no later than December 31 of the Plan Year how he or she will receive the Fee for the following calendar year with regard to the payment of Annual Fees for services performed and Meeting Fees for Board meetings attended by the Director during such calendar year. Each Director who becomes a Director during a Plan Year must elect within 30 days after becoming a Director how he or she will receive the Fee for such calendar year. Each election must be made by the Director filing an election form with the Secretary of AutoZone. If a Director does not file an election form for each Plan Year by the specified date the Director will be deemed to have elected to
 
receive and defer the Fee in the manner elected by the Director in his or her last valid election or, if there had been no prior election, will be deemed to have elected to receive all of the Fee in Shares. Any election to defer a portion of the Fee made by a person who becomes a Director during a Plan Year will be valid as to the portion of the Fee received after the election is filed with the Secretary of AutoZone. When an election is made for a Plan Year, the Director may not revoke or change that election with respect to such Plan Year.
     SECTION 5. THE SHARES.
     If a Director elects (or is deemed to elect) to receive Shares in payment of all or any part of the Director's Fee, the number of Shares to be issued on any Compensation Date shall be a whole number of shares (truncating any fractional share) nearest to one-fourth of the amount of the Fee to be paid in Shares for the Plan Year divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Compensation Date. The amount of the Fee representing a fractional share not paid in Shares shall be paid in cash. Any Shares issued under this Plan will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and, so long as shares of the Common Stock are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, will be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Any payment to a Director under this Section 5 shall be made upon the applicable Compensation Date.
     SECTION 6. THE UNITS.
     If a Director defers any portion of the Fee in the form of Units, then on each Compensation Date, AutoZone will credit a Unit Account maintained for the Director with a number of Units (rounded to the nearest one-tenth) equal to (1) one-fourth of the dollar amount of the Fee that the Director has elected to defer in the form of Units for the Plan Year divided by (2) the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Compensation Date. AutoZone will credit to the Director's Unit Account on the date any dividend is paid on the Common Stock, an additional number of Units equal to (i) the aggregate amount of the dividend that would be paid on a number of Shares equal to the number of Units credited to the Director's Unit Account on the date the dividend is paid divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share as of that date.
     SECTION 6A. 2005 SPECIAL ELECTION.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, with respect to calendar year 2005 only, Directors shall be permitted, on or prior to March 15, 2005, to make an irrevocable election (the "Special Election") to defer a portion of Fees which have not previously been paid or become payable in respect of services provided during calendar year 2005 in the form of Units. A Special Election shall specify, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, (i) that portion of the Fee to be paid in Units, and (ii) the distribution schedule applicable to such Units under Section 7 of the Plan. Any Director who does not make a Special Election on or prior to March 15, 2005 shall be deemed to have elected not to defer any portion of the Fee payable in respect of services performed during 2005. For the avoidance of doubt, amounts deferred pursuant to a Special Election shall include, proportionately, any Meeting Fees earned during the last Plan Quarter of 2005 that would, absent the Special Election, become payable during the first Plan Quarter of 2006.
 
     SECTION 7. DISTRIBUTION OF THE AMOUNTS IN A UNIT ACCOUNT.
     Upon the Termination Date for a Director, such Director shall be entitled to receive that whole number of Shares (truncating any fractional share) with which the Director's Unit Account is credited. Subject to Section 11 hereof, the Director may elect to receive such Shares in any one of the following forms:
          (a) a single lump-sum issuable as soon as practicable after the Termination Date; or
          (b) a single lump-sum issuable as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date; or
          (c) a single lump-sum issuable as soon as practicable after the tenth anniversary of the Termination Date; or
          (d) two (2) equal installments, one of which shall be issuable as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date and the other of which shall be issuable as soon as practicable after the tenth anniversary of the Termination Date, as provided below.
     If the Director has elected to receive the Shares in the manner set forth in (d) above (i.e., in two equal installments), one-half of the Shares credited to the Unit Account as of the Termination Date will be issued to the Director for each installment plus additional Shares equal to the Units credited to the Unit Account respecting dividends paid on the Common Stock since the prior installment was made (or, in the case of the first installment, since the Termination Date). Any fractional share amount shall be valued at the Fair Market Value and be paid in cash at the date of distribution of the Shares.
     SECTION 8. CONVERSION OF UNIT ACCOUNT.
     Subject to Section 11 hereof, a Director who has a Unit Account may convert all (but not less than all) of the Unit Account into a Deferral Account. The cash amount to be credited to the Director's Deferral Account upon the conversion shall equal (i) the number of Units credited to his or her Unit Account so converted multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of the Director's election to convert.
     Any election to convert must be made on a form prescribed by AutoZone and filed with its Secretary. The conversion of a Unit Account into a Deferral Account shall be deemed to occur on the date of the Director's election, except that, unless the Board provides otherwise, any portion of a Unit Account granted within six months of the date of election shall be converted to a Deferral Account six months and one day from the date in which the Units representing such portion were credited to the Unit Account.
     A Deferral Account shall accrue interest from the effective date of conversion at the Interest Rate, accrued and compounded quarterly.
 
     SECTION 9. DISTRIBUTION OF THE AMOUNTS IN A DEFERRAL ACCOUNT.
     Upon the Termination Date for a former Director, such former Director shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to the amount with which the former Director's Deferral Account is credited. Subject to Section 11 hereof, the former Director may elect to receive such cash in any one of the following forms:
          (a) a single lump-sum payable as soon as practicable after the Termination Date; or
          (b) a single lump-sum payable as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date; or
          (c) a single lump-sum payable as soon as practicable after the tenth anniversary of the Termination Date; or
          (d) two (2) equal installments, one of which shall be payable as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date and the other of which shall be payable as soon as practicable after the tenth anniversary of the Termination Date, as provided below.
     If the former Director has elected to receive the cash in the manner set forth in (d) above (i.e., in two equal installments), one-half of the amount credited to the Deferral Account as of the Termination Date will be paid in each installment, along with the additional amount credited to the Deferral Amount as interest (at the Interest Rate) since the prior installment was paid (or, in the case of the first installment, since the Termination Date).
     SECTION 10. DISTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF A DIRECTOR'S DEATH.
     With respect to a Director's Unit Account (or, if applicable, the Director's Deferral Account), each Director who defers any part of the Fee payable to him or her in any Plan Year may designate one or more beneficiaries which may be changed from time to time upon written notice to AutoZone. The designation of a beneficiary must be made by filing with AutoZone's Secretary a form prescribed by AutoZone. If no designation of a beneficiary is made, any deferred benefits under this Plan will be paid to the Director's or former Director's estate. If a Director dies while in office or a former Director dies during the installment payment period, AutoZone will issue the Shares that are issuable (or if applicable, pay the amounts of cash that are payable) to the Director or former Director in the manner set forth in the most recent timely election filed by such Director or former Director, or if no such election has been filed, in a single lump-sum as soon as practicable after the death of the Director or the former Director.
     SECTION 11. TIMING OF ELECTION TO RECEIVE DEFERRED BENEFITS IN INSTALLMENTS.
     A Director's election as to the time and form of distribution of his Unit Account and/or Deferral Account under Sections 7 and 9 of the Plan and election to convert the
 
Unit Account into the Deferral Account under Section 8 of the Plan, if applicable, shall satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(a) and the terms and conditions of the Plan. Such election shall be irrevocable when made, and shall become effective only if made no later than December 31 of the preceding Plan Year in which compensation is received for service as a Director.
     A Director may make a subsequent election with regard to the time and form of distribution of his Unit Account and/or Deferral Account under Sections 7 and 9 of the Plan, provided that, (i) such election shall have no effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made, (ii) the payment with respect to which such election is made shall be deferred for an additional period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been paid, and (iii) such election shall be made at least 12 months prior to the first date on which any amounts would otherwise be paid. Such election shall be irrevocable when made and otherwise satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b) and the terms and conditions of the Plan.
     A Director may make a special election to change the time and form of distribution of his Unit Account and/or Deferral Account under Sections 7 and 9 of the Plan or convert the Unit Account into the Deferral Account under Section 8 of the Plan, in accordance with the transitional relief under Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, Q/A-19(c), as extended by Internal Revenue Service Notices 2006-79 and 2007-86, and the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the terms and conditions of the Plan. Such election shall be made no later than December 31, 2008, and shall be irrevocable when made.
     A Director's election under the Plan with respect to compensation deferred under the Plan as of December 31, 2004, if any, shall be grandfathered for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and is intended to satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-6 (including the transition and grandfather rules thereunder). Such election shall remain in effect unless otherwise modified pursuant to this Section 11.
     SECTION 12. HOLDING PERIOD
     Notwithstanding anything contained herein, unless the Board provides otherwise, (i) no Shares issued hereunder may be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred until at least six months and one day have elapsed from the date on which such Shares were issued, and (ii) no right or interest of a Director or a former Director in Units credited his or her Unit Account hereunder (including Units credited to such Unit Account respecting dividends paid on the Common Stock) shall be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred until at least six months and one day have elapsed from the date on which such Units were credited to such Unit Account, except by will or in accordance with the laws of decent and distribution.
     SECTION 13. HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS.
     Prior to the complete distribution of a Director's Unit Account and/or Deferral Account, such Director may request a withdrawal of any portion of his or her Unit Account or Deferral Account in an amount sufficient to meet a "hardship." For purposes of this Plan, "hardship" shall mean a demonstrated and severe financial hardship resulting
 
from any one or more of the following: (i) sudden or unexpected illness or accident of the Director or of a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of the Director, (ii) a loss of the Director's property due to casualty, or (iii) any other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the Director's control; in each case only to the extent that the hardship is not relieved (a) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (b) by liquidation of the Director's assets (to the extent that such liquidation does not itself cause a "hardship"), or (c) by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. The Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine the existence of a bona fide hardship based on non-discriminatory procedures, taking into account any then applicable rulings or regulations from the Internal Revenue Service. The standards established by the Board for determining the existence of hardship shall be uniformly applied to all Directors who request such a withdrawal and the Board's decision with respect to each such request shall be final.
     An approved hardship withdrawal shall be paid to the Director in cash as soon as practicable after the approval. In the event that part or all of the withdrawal is to be made from a Unit Account, a number of Units equal to (i) the amount of the hardship withdrawal required to be made from the Unit Account, divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of approval, shall be converted into cash and paid to the Director as provided herein, and the balance of the Unit Account shall be reduced accordingly.
     SECTION 14. WITHHOLDING FOR TAXES.
     AutoZone will withhold the amount of cash and Shares necessary to satisfy AutoZone's obligation to withhold federal, state, and local income and other taxes on any benefits received by the Director, the former Director or a beneficiary under this Plan.
     SECTION 15. NO TRANSFER OF RIGHTS UNDER THE PLAN.
     A Director or former Director shall not have the right to transfer, grant any security interest in or otherwise encumber rights he or she may have under this Plan, any Deferral Account or any Unit Account maintained for the Director or former Director or any interest therein. No right or interest of a Director or a former Director in a Deferral Account or a Unit Account shall be subject to any forced or involuntary disposition or to any charge, liability, or obligation of the Director or former Director, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Director or former Director or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors' rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be null, void, and without effect.
     SECTION 16. UNFUNDED PLAN.
     This Plan will be unfunded for federal tax purposes. The Deferral Accounts and the Unit Accounts are entries in the Special Ledger only and are merely a promise to make payments in the future. AutoZone's obligations under this Plan are unsecured, general contractual obligations of AutoZone.
 
     SECTION 17. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.
     Unless sooner terminated, this Plan shall expire on December 31, 2012, so that no benefits may be granted hereunder after that date. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 17, the Plan may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Board. However, without approval of AutoZone's stockholders given within 12 months before or after the action by the Board, no action of the Board may increase the limit imposed in Section 19 on the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Plan (other than adjustments under Section 20), change the type of equity compensation paid under the plan, extend the term of the plan, materially change the method of determining the price of equity compensation granted under the plan, materially modify the definition of "Director" under the Plan, or modify the Plan in a manner requiring stockholder approval under the listed company rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and no action of the Board may be taken that would otherwise require stockholder approval as a matter of applicable law, regulation or rule.
     An amendment or the termination of this Plan will not adversely affect the right of a Director, former Director, or Beneficiary to receive Shares issuable or cash payable at the effective date of the amendment or termination or any rights that a Director, former Director, or a Beneficiary has in any Deferral Account or Unit Account at the effective date of the amendment or termination. If the Plan is terminated, however, AutoZone may, at its option, accelerate the payment of all deferred and other benefits payable under this Plan.
     SECTION 18. GOVERNING LAW.
     This Plan shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof. AutoZone has the right to interpret this Plan, and any interpretation by AutoZone shall be conclusive as to the meaning of this Plan.
     SECTION 19. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.
     AutoZone shall reserve 100,000 Shares for issuance under the Plan. Shares issued under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. No Plan participant shall have any of the rights or privileges of an AutoZone stockholder in respect to any of the Shares unless and until certificates representing such Shares have been issued by AutoZone.
     SECTION 20. CORPORATE EVENTS.
     (a) Subject to subsection (d) below, in the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin- off, combination, repurchase, liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of AutoZone (including, but not limited to, a Corporate Transaction, as defined below), or exchange of Common Stock or other securities,
 
issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of AutoZone, or other similar corporate transaction or event, in the Committee's sole discretion, affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of the number and kind of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) which may be granted under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section 19 on the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Plan, and adjustments to the number and kind of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) that may be paid upon the distribution of Units).

     (a) (i) On January 1 of each year, each Non-Employee Director as of such date shall be granted an Option to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock (subject to the adjustments provided in Section 7) as determined by the Board, in its discretion, and set forth in the AutoZone, Inc. Director Compensation Program (the "Program), and (ii) each new Non-Employee Director shall be granted an initial Option to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock (subject to the adjustments provided in Section 7) as of the date of his or her election as a director and a pro-rata portion of that year's annual grant set forth in (i), as determined by the Board, in its discretion, and set forth in the Program;
     (b) On January 1 of each year, each Non-Employee Director who, as of December 31 of the prior year, beneficially owns shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as determined below) greater than or equal to five (5) times such Non- Employee Director's base retainer fee (not including any supplemental retainer fees, meeting fees, or fees for being a committee chair) payable by the Company for such year, shall be granted an Option to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock (subject to the adjustments provided in Section 7) as determined by the Board, in its discretion, and set forth in the Program. For purposes of this Plan, the "Fair Market
 
Value" of a share of Common Stock shall mean, as to any particular day, the average of the highest and lowest prices quoted for a share of Common Stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the immediately prior Business Day.

The Wall Street Journal
     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no Option shall be granted unless sufficient shares (subject to said adjustments) are then available therefor under Sections 2 and 7. In consideration of the granting of an Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to remain as a Director of the Company for a period of at least one year after the date upon which the Option was granted (the "date of grant"). Nothing in the Plan shall, however, confer upon any Optionee any right to continue as a director of the Company or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company or the Company's stockholders, which are hereby expressly reserved, to remove any Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by the Company's bylaws and applicable law.
     SECTION 6. OPTION PROVISIONS.
     Each Option shall be evidenced by a written agreement between the Company and the Non-Employee Director and shall contain the following terms and provisions, and such other terms and provisions as the Committee may authorize:
     (a) The exercise price of each Option shall be equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock as of the date of grant;
     (b) Payment for shares of Common Stock purchased upon any exercise of the Option shall be made in full at the time of such exercise (i) in cash, (ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, (iii) by delivery of a notice that the Optionee has placed a market sell order with a broker approved by the Company with respect to shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of the Option, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the option exercise price, or (iv) by a combination of any of the foregoing methods of payment. For purposes of exercising the Option, the value of any shares of Common Stock delivered in payment shall be the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock as of the day of delivery;
     (c) Subject to subsection (d) below and Section 7 hereof, the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable on the first to occur of either:
 
     (d) The Option shall terminate and may not be exercised to any extent by anyone after the first to occur of the following events:
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Option may not be exercised prior to the admission of the shares of stock issuable upon exercise of the Option to listing on notice of issuance on any stock exchange on which shares of the same class are then listed; nor unless and until, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such securities may be issued and delivered without causing the Company to be in violation of or incur any liability under any Federal, state or other securities law, any requirement of any securities exchange listing agreement to which the Company may be a party, or any other requirement of law or of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Company; and
     (f) The Option shall not be transferable by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, may not be pledged or hypothecated, and shall be exercisable during the Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee or by his or her guardian or legal representative.
     SECTION 7. CORPORATE EVENTS.
     (a) Subject to subsection (d) below, in the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin- off, combination, repurchase, liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (including, but not limited to, a Corporate Transaction, as defined below), or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common
 
Stock or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event, in the Committee's sole discretion, affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any Option, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of:
     (b) Subject to subsection (d) below, in the event of any Corporate Transaction (as defined below), the Plan shall terminate, and all outstanding Options shall terminate, unless provisions shall be made in writing in connection with such Corporate Transaction for the continuance of the Plan and/or for the assumption of Options theretofore granted, or the substitution for such Options of options covering the stock of a successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices, in which event the Plan and Options theretofore granted shall continue in the manner and under the terms so provided. If the Plan and unexercised Options would otherwise terminate pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then, for such period of time prior to the consummation of such Corporate Transaction as the Company shall designate, all outstanding Options shall be exercisable as to all shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(c) hereof or the provisions of such Option;
     (c) For purposes of the Plan, the term "Corporate Transaction" shall mean any of the following stockholder-approved transactions to which the Company is a party:
 
the total combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities are transferred or issued to a person or persons different from those who held such securities immediately prior to such merger.
     (d) No adjustment or action described in this Section 7 shall be authorized or occur to the extent such adjustment or action would result in short-swing profits liability under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act unless the Committee determines that the Option is not to comply with such exemptive conditions.
     SECTION 8. TAX WITHHOLDING.
     The Company shall be entitled to require payment in cash or deduction from other compensation payable to each Optionee of any sums required by federal, state or local tax laws to be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting or exercise of any Option. The Committee may in its discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement allow such Optionee to elect to have the Company withhold shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under such Option (or allow the return of shares of Common Stock) having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the sums required to be withheld.
     SECTION 9. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF PLAN.
     Unless sooner terminated, this Plan shall expire on December 31, 2012, so that no Option may be granted hereunder after that date although any option outstanding on that date may thereafter be exercised in accordance with its terms. The Board may alter, amend, suspend or terminate this Plan, provided that no such action shall deprive an Optionee, without his or her consent, of any Option previously granted pursuant to the Plan or of any of the Optionee's rights under such Option. However, without approval of the Company's stockholders given within 12 months before or after the action by the Board, no action of the Board may increase the limit imposed in Section 2 on the maximum number of shares which may be issued as Options under the Plan (other than adjustments under Section 7), change the types of shares issued under the Plan, extend the term of the Plan, materially change the method of determining the exercise price under the Plan, materially modify the definition of "Non-Employee Director" under the Plan, or modify the Plan in a manner requiring stockholder approval under the listed company rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and no action of the Board may be taken that would otherwise require stockholder approval as a matter of applicable law, regulation or rule.
     SECTION 10. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
     This Plan, the granting and vesting of Options under this Plan and the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock and the payment of money under this Plan or under Options granted hereunder are subject to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal securities laws and federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary
 
or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under this Plan shall be subject to such restriction, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Options granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules or regulations.
     SECTION 11. TITLES.
     Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Plan.
     SECTION 12. GOVERNING LAW.
     This Plan and any agreements hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the conflicts of laws rules thereof.
     SECTION 13. STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.
     The Company shall take such actions with respect to the Plan as may be necessary to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. This Plan shall be submitted for the approval of the Company's stockholders within twelve months after the date of the Board's adoption of this Plan. This Plan shall become effective immediately upon approval by the stockholders.
     SECTION 14. SECTION 409A.
     To the extent applicable, the Plan and any written agreement between the Company and the Non-Employee Director that provides for the grant of an Option (the "Option Agreement") shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. Any Option granted under the Plan is intended to be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, as providing for an option to purchase service recipient stock as described in Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i)(A) of the Department of Treasury regulations. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan or any Option Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that an Option may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Option Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Option from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Option, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

AutoZone, Inc. Enhanced Severance Pay Plan
On February 13, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc. (AutoZone) adopted the AutoZone, Inc. Enhanced Severance Pay Plan (the Plan).
The purpose of the Plan is to provide severance pay to key AutoZone employees who have executed a non-compete agreement with AutoZone and whose employment subsequently is terminated without cause (as defined in the non-compete agreement), other than as a result of death, total disability, or any voluntary resignation or termination; provided such employee is not eligible for severance benefits under any other AutoZone plan or agreement and that he or she executes a release satisfactory in form and substance to AutoZone at the time of termination.
Under the Plan, a participating employee is eligible to receive periodic severance payments in the form of salary continuation for a period of time determined by his or her position and years of service at the time of termination.  Executive officers are eligible to receive periodic severance payments for 12 to 24 months, vice presidents for 6 to 12 months, and other key employees for 3 to 9 months, depending in each case upon their years of service.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Plan which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
This Agreement is made this 14 day of February, 2008, by and between AutoZone, Inc. (AutoZone) and _________________ (Executive).
th
1.   Executive is employed by a subsidiary of AutoZone. Executive acknowledges that his employment is at will.
   
Employment.
2.   In the event that Executives employment is terminated by AutoZone without Cause (defined below), and provided that at that time, Executive executes a release of all claims against AutoZone accrued as of the date of such release in a form acceptable to AutoZone and such release has become irrevocable, Executive will be entitled to the severance benefits set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the Enhanced Severance).  Executive acknowledges that the Enhanced Severance benefits are greater than those to which he would be entitled under AutoZones standard severance policy, and that he is not eligible for severance under AutoZones standard severance policy.  Executive (or his estate) will not be entitled to the Enhanced Severance in the event of (i) his termination for Cause (defined below); (ii) his voluntary resignation, including retirement; (iii) his death; or (iv) a determination by AutoZone that he is totally disabled, as that term is defined in AutoZones long term disability plan.
   
Severance.
3.   In consideration of Executives employment or continued employment, and the Enhanced Severance benefits provided herein, Executive and AutoZone hereby agree as follows:
   
Covenants.
(a)   Executive acknowledges that because of his skills, Executives position with AutoZone, and the customer relationships and/or confidential information to which Executive shall have access on account of such employment with AutoZone, competition by Executive with AutoZone would damage AutoZone in a manner which could not be adequately compensated by damages or an action at law.  In view of such circumstances, Executive agrees that, during his employment with AutoZone and for a period of two (2) years thereafter (the Non-Compete Term), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, consult for, participate in or be connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation or control of any business that derives revenues from the retail, wholesale, or commercial sale, manufacture, or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals in any state, province, territory or foreign country in which AutoZone operates during the Non-Compete Term , including, but not limited to, Advance Auto Parts, Inc., CSK Auto, Inc. (Checkers/Schucks/Kragen), General Parts, Inc. (CARQUEST Auto Parts), Genuine Parts Corporation (NAPA), OReilly Automotive, Inc., The Pep Boys  Manny, Moe & Jack, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Nothing in this Subsection 3(a) shall preclude Executive from accepting employment with a company that derives less than five percent (5%) of its annual gross revenues from the retail, wholesale or commercial sale, manufacture or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals (other than those companies specifically listed above), provided that Executive does not provide advice and consultation to such company concerning the retail, wholesale or commercial sale, manufacture or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals.
   
Non-Competition.
(b)   Executive further agrees that, during Executives employment with AutoZone, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a third party, solicit, divert, influence, or attempt to divert or influence any customer of AutoZone or seek to cause any customer of AutoZone to refrain from doing business with or patronizing AutoZone.  Executive also agrees that, during Executives employment with AutoZone, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he shall not, directly or indirectly, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a third party, solicit or attempt to solicit the employees of AutoZone or seek to cause them to resign their employment with AutoZone.
   
Non-Solicitation.
(c) Executive acknowledges that he possesses and will continue to possess information which has been created, discovered or developed by AutoZone in the conduct of its business that is valuable, special and unique to AutoZone and not generally known by third parties, including but not limited to, its methods of operations, its lists of customers and employees, its pricing lists, its pricing and purchasing strategies, and other information Executive has reason to know AutoZone would like to treat as confidential.  Unless previously authorized in writing by AutoZone, Executive will not, at any time, disclose to others, or use, or allow anyone else to disclose or use, any confidential information except as may be necessary in the performance of Executives employment with AutoZone.
   
Confidentiality.
 
4.   Given the nature of the position Executive holds with AutoZone, the nature of AutoZones business, and the sensitive nature of the information and duties Executive will have with AutoZone, the parties acknowledge that the limitations provided for herein, including but not limited to, the scope of activities prohibited, the geographic area covered, and the time limitations, are reasonable and have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties.
   
Reasonable Limitations.
5.   In the event of an actual or threatened breach by Executive of any of the covenants of this Agreement, AutoZone, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, shall be entitled to obtain, without the necessity for any bond or other security, specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent the breach of any of the covenants of this Agreement.  Further, if Executive violates any of the covenants of this Agreement, his entitlement to the severance benefits set forth on Exhibit A shall immediately cease, and the term and covenant violated shall be automatically extended to a like period of time from the date on which Executive ceases such violation or from the date of the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of an order or judgment enforcing such covenants, whichever period is later.  In the event Executive is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be in breach of any of the covenants of this Agreement, AutoZone shall be entitled to its costs and reasonable attorneys fees associated with enforcing such covenant or covenants.
   
Remedies for Breach.
6.   The parties hereto intend that this Agreement be enforced as written.  However, if any provision, or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision and/or delete specific words or phrases and in its reduced or revised form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.
   
Reaffirmation of Scope or Duration.
7.   For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall be defined as the willful engagement in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to AutoZone, monetarily or otherwise; provided, however, no act or failure to act will be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of AutoZone.
   
Definition of Cause.
8.   For purposes of this Agreement and the Enhanced Severance described in Exhibit A, in the event that Executive is terminated by AutoZone without Cause, AutoZone and Executive reasonably anticipate that Executive will either (i) perform no further services for AutoZone, whether as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, after the effective date of such termination, or (ii) after the effective date of such termination, permanently decrease the level of services performed by Executive for AutoZone to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of services performed for AutoZone in any capacity, whether as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise, over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services if Executive has been providing services to AutoZone for less than thirty-six (36) months).
   
Compliance with Section 409A.
9.   This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law provisions.  Executive agrees that the exclusive venue for any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be the state or federal courts located in Memphis, Tennessee.
   
Governing Law.
10.   This Agreement, with Exhibit A, contains the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes any prior understandings and agreements between them respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.  It may not be changed orally, but only by agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.
   
Entire Agreement; Amendment.
11.   The waiver by AutoZone of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.  In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it may be severed from the Agreement and the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall continue to be binding and effective.
   
Waiver of Breach; Severability.
12.   This Agreement and the benefits hereunder are personal to AutoZone and are not assignable or transferable by Executive, nor may the services to be performed hereunder be assigned by AutoZone to any person, firm or corporation, except a parent or affiliate of AutoZone; provided, however, that this Agreement and the benefits hereunder may be assigned by AutoZone to any person, firm or corporation acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of AutoZone or its subsidiary or to any corporation or other entity into which AutoZone or its subsidiary may be merged or consolidated and this Agreement and the benefits hereunder will be deemed automatically assigned to any such corporation or entity.
   
Non-Assignability.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date and year first stated above.

The benefits afforded to Executive hereunder will be in lieu of benefits under any other plan, program or agreement, including without limitation, AutoZones standard severance policy.
Enhanced Severance benefits will commence as of the date of termination of employment Executive is deemed by AutoZone to be or have been a specified employee within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A at any relevant time, in which case payment of all or a portion of the Enhanced Severance benefits will be delayed until the date that is at least six months and one day after the date of Executives termination.  All amounts that would otherwise have been paid during such six-month period shall instead be paid in a lump sum on the first pay day following such six-month period.
unless
Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, all compensation and benefits end upon termination of employment.
Periodic severance will be paid to Executive in accordance with AutoZones Enhanced Severance Policy (the Policy) in effect as of the date of execution of this Agreement, as applicable to Executives position at the time of termination of employment.  The Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into the Agreement, and a copy of the Policy has been provided to Executive.
Pursuant to the Policy, Executive will receive the periodic severance paid bi-weekly in the same amount and manner as Executives base salary prior to termination for the following time periods (Severance Period):
Medical, vision and dental insurance coverage may be continued during the Severance Period, up to a maximum of 18 months, if Executive makes a COBRA election.  The cost to Executive for this coverage during the lesser of the Severance Period or 18 months will be the same as he was paying immediately prior to termination, subject to increases affecting plan participants generally.  AutoZone will pay the difference between Executives cost and the amount of the COBRA premiums during the lesser of the Severance Period or 18 months; thereafter, COBRA premium payments, if any, will be the sole responsibility of Executive.
The terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreements govern treatment of stock options upon termination of employment.  Stock Option Agreements generally provide that options remain exercisable for 30 days from the date of termination without Cause, and that stock options that are unvested as of the termination date will be forfeited.
A lump-sum, prorated share of any bonus incentives earned during the period prior to Executives termination will be paid to Executive when incentives are paid generally to similarly-situated employees.  Eligibility for additional bonuses ceases upon termination.  See individual plan documentation for detailed information about eligibility and when incentives are earned.
An appropriate level of outplacement services, as determined by AutoZone in its discretion, will be provided to Executive based on his individual circumstances.
Some optional life and disability insurance policies may have portability features which allow Executive to continue the coverage at Executives cost.
To the extent applicable, this Program shall be interpreted in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  AutoZone may, in its sole discretion, take any actions it deems necessary or appropriate, including without limitation, amendment or termination of this Program, to (a) exempt these payments and benefits from the application of Code Section 409A, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
AutoZone reserves the right to terminate, suspend, withdraw, amend or modify the benefits contained in the Policy, but any such action will not affect the benefits for Executive under the Agreement. The plan administrator has sole authority to interpret the provisions of the Policy and otherwise construe AutoZones intent in case of any dispute.

AutoZone may, in its sole discretion, take any actions it deems necessary or appropriate, including without limitation, amendment or termination of this Program, to (a) exempt these payments and benefits from the application of Code Section 409A, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
AutoZone reserves the right to terminate, suspend, withdraw, amend or modify the benefits contained in the Policy, but any such action will not affect the benefits for Officer under the Agreement. The plan administrator has sole authority to interpret the provisions of the Policy and otherwise construe AutoZones intent in case of any dispute.
 
 
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.4
 
This Agreement is made this 14th day of February, 2008, by and between AutoZone, Inc. (AutoZone) and William C. Rhodes, III (Executive).
1.   Executive is the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of AutoZone and is employed by a subsidiary of AutoZone. Executive acknowledges that his employment is at will and his service on the Board of Directors is subject to his election as a director by AutoZones stockholders.
   
Employment.
2.   In the event that Executives employment is terminated by AutoZone without Cause (defined below), and provided that at that time, Executive executes a release of all claims against AutoZone accrued as of the date of such release in a form acceptable to AutoZone and such release has become irrevocable, Executive will be entitled to the severance benefits set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the Enhanced Severance).  Executive acknowledges that the Enhanced Severance benefits are greater than those to which he would be entitled under AutoZones standard severance policy, and that he is not eligible for severance under AutoZones standard severance policy.  Executive (or his estate) will not be entitled to the Enhanced Severance in the event of (i) his termination for Cause (defined below); (ii) his voluntary resignation, including retirement; (iii) his death; or (iv) a determination by AutoZone that he is totally disabled, as that term is defined in AutoZones long term disability plan.
   
Severance.
3.   In consideration of Executives employment or continued employment, and the Enhanced Severance benefits provided herein, Executive and AutoZone hereby agree as follows:
   
Covenants.
(a)   Executive acknowledges that because of his skills, Executives position with AutoZone, and the customer relationships and/or confidential information to which Executive shall have access on account of such employment with AutoZone, competition by Executive with AutoZone would damage AutoZone in a manner which could not be adequately compensated by damages or an action at law.  In view of such circumstances, Executive agrees that, during his employment with AutoZone and for a period of three (3) years thereafter (the Non-Compete Term), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, consult for, participate in or be connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation or control of any business that derives revenues from the retail, wholesale, or commercial sale, manufacture, or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals in any state, province, territory or foreign country in which AutoZone operates during the Non-Compete Term, including, but not limited to, Advance Auto Parts, Inc., CSK Auto, Inc. (Checkers/Schucks/Kragen), General Parts, Inc. (CARQUEST Auto Parts), Genuine Parts Corporation (NAPA), OReilly Automotive, Inc., The Pep Boys  Manny, Moe & Jack, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Nothing in this Subsection 3(a) shall preclude Executive from accepting employment with a company that derives less than five percent (5%) of its annual gross revenues from the retail, wholesale or commercial sale, manufacture or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals (other than those companies specifically listed above), provided that Executive does not provide advice and consultation to such company concerning the retail, wholesale or commercial sale, manufacture or distribution of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories, motor oil or related chemicals.
   
Non-Competition.
(b)   Executive further agrees that, during Executives employment with AutoZone, and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a third party, solicit, divert, influence, or attempt to divert or influence any customer of AutoZone or seek to cause any customer of AutoZone to refrain from doing business with or patronizing AutoZone.  Executive also agrees that, during Executives employment with AutoZone, and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, he shall not, directly or indirectly, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a third party, solicit or attempt to solicit the employees of AutoZone or seek to cause them to resign their employment with AutoZone.
   
Non-Solicitation.
(c)                                            Executive acknowledges that he possesses and will continue to possess information which has been created, discovered or developed by AutoZone in the conduct of its business that is valuable, special and unique to AutoZone and not generally known by third parties, including but not limited to, its methods of operations, its lists of customers and employees, its pricing lists, its pricing and purchasing strategies, and other information Executive has reason to know AutoZone would like to treat as confidential.  Unless previously authorized in writing by AutoZone, Executive will not, at any time, disclose to others, or use, or allow anyone else to disclose or use, any confidential information except as may be necessary in the performance of Executives employment with AutoZone.
   
Confidentiality.
4.   Given the nature of the position Executive holds with AutoZone, the nature of AutoZones business, and the sensitive nature of the information and duties Executive will have with AutoZone, the parties acknowledge that the limitations provided for herein, including but not limited to, the scope of activities prohibited, the geographic area covered, and the time limitations, are reasonable and have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties.
   
Reasonable Limitations.
5.   In the event of an actual or threatened breach by Executive of any of the covenants of this Agreement, AutoZone, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, shall be entitled to obtain, without the necessity for any bond or other security, specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent the breach of any of the covenants of this Agreement.  Further, if Executive violates any of the covenants of this Agreement, his entitlement to the severance benefits set forth on Exhibit A shall immediately cease, and the term and covenant violated shall be automatically extended to a like period of time from the date on which Executive ceases such violation or from the date of the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of an order or judgment enforcing such covenants, whichever period is later.  In the event Executive is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be in breach of any of the covenants of this Agreement, AutoZone shall be entitled to its costs and reasonable attorneys fees associated with enforcing such covenant or covenants.
   
Remedies for Breach.
6.   The parties hereto intend that this Agreement be enforced as written.  However, if any provision, or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision and/or delete specific words or phrases and in its reduced or revised form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.
   
Reaffirmation of Scope or Duration.
7.   For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall be defined as the willful engagement in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to AutoZone, monetarily or otherwise; provided, however, no act or failure to act will be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of AutoZone.
   
Definition of Cause.
8.   For purposes of this Agreement and the Enhanced Severance described in Exhibit A, in the event that Executive is terminated by AutoZone without Cause, AutoZone and Executive reasonably anticipate that Executive will either (i) perform no further services for AutoZone, whether as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, after the effective date of such termination, or (ii) after the effective date of such termination, permanently decrease the level of services performed by Executive for AutoZone to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of services performed for AutoZone in any capacity, whether as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise, over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services if Executive has been providing services to AutoZone for less than thirty-six (36) months).
   
Compliance with Section 409A.
9.   This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law provisions.  Executive agrees that the exclusive venue for any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be the state or federal courts located in Memphis, Tennessee.
   
Governing Law.
10.   This Agreement, with Exhibit A, contains the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes any prior understandings and agreements between them respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.  It may not be changed orally, but only by agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.
   
Entire Agreement; Amendment.
11.   The waiver by AutoZone of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.  In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it may be severed from the Agreement and the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall continue to be binding and effective.
   
Waiver of Breach; Severability.
12.   This Agreement and the benefits hereunder are personal to AutoZone and are not assignable or transferable by Executive, nor may the services to be performed hereunder be assigned by AutoZone to any person, firm or corporation, except a parent or affiliate of AutoZone; provided, however, that this Agreement and the benefits hereunder may be assigned by AutoZone to any person, firm or corporation acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of AutoZone or its subsidiary or to any corporation or other entity into which AutoZone or its subsidiary may be merged or consolidated and this Agreement and the benefits hereunder will be deemed automatically assigned to any such corporation or entity.
   
Non-Assignability.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date and year first stated above.

The benefits afforded to Executive hereunder will be in lieu of benefits under any other plan, program or agreement, including without limitation, AutoZones standard severance policy.
Enhanced Severance benefits will commence as of the date of termination of employment Executive is deemed by AutoZone to be or have been a specified employee within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A at any relevant time, in which case payment of all or a portion of the Enhanced Severance benefits will be delayed until the date that is at least six months and one day after the date of Executives termination.  All amounts that would otherwise have been paid during such six-month period shall instead be paid in a lump sum on the first pay day following such six-month period.
unless
Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, all compensation and benefits end upon termination of employment.
Executive will receive a severance payment in an amount equal to 2.99 times his then-current base salary.
Medical, vision and dental insurance coverage may be continued up to a maximum of 18 months after the date of termination of employment if Executive makes a COBRA election.  The cost to Executive for this coverage will be the same as he was paying immediately prior to termination, subject to increases affecting plan participants generally.  AutoZone will pay the difference between Executives cost and the amount of the COBRA premiums.
The terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreements govern treatment of stock options upon termination of employment.  Stock Option Agreements generally provide that options remain exercisable for 30 days from the date of termination without Cause, and that stock options that are unvested as of the termination date will be forfeited.
A lump-sum, prorated share of any bonus incentives earned during the period prior to Executives termination will be paid to Executive when incentives are paid generally to similarly-situated employees.  Eligibility for additional bonuses ceases upon termination.  See individual plan documentation for detailed information about eligibility and when incentives are earned.
An appropriate level of outplacement services, as determined by AutoZone in its discretion, will be provided to Executive based on his individual circumstances.
Some optional life and disability insurance policies may have portability features which allow Executive to continue the coverage at Executives cost.
To the extent applicable, this Program shall be interpreted in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  AutoZone may, in its sole discretion, take any actions it deems necessary or appropriate, including without limitation, amendment or termination of this Program, to (a) exempt these payments and benefits from the application of Code Section 409A, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
AutoZone reserves the right to terminate, suspend, withdraw, amend or modify the benefits contained in the Policy, but any such action will not affect the benefits for Executive under the Agreement. The plan administrator has sole authority to interpret the provisions of the Policy and otherwise construe AutoZones intent in case of any dispute.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 26, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 9, 2008, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)         Exhibits               99.1    Press Release dated February 26, 2008.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 26, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.3 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 9, 2008, an increase of 3.0% from fiscal second quarter 2007. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 3.6% over the same period last year to $106.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.7% to $1.67 per share from $1.45 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.9% (versus 49.2% last year). The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to ongoing category management efforts. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 35.2% (versus 34.6% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus the previous year.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 8.2% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of February 9, 2008, was $504 thousand versus $496 thousand last year, an increase of 1.6%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $55 thousand from $63 thousand last year.
AutoZone did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the second quarter. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. For the fiscal year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350 million.
"I would like to thank our AutoZoners for delivering another quarter of record earnings, and, most importantly, for their ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, we delivered EBIT growth in excess of four percent and our earnings per share again grew in excess of 15%. During the quarter, we experienced some deceleration in sales trends from the first fiscal quarter, however, we remain optimistic in our outlook for the future. Additionally, as our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 9, 2008, AutoZone opened 28 new stores and replaced two stores in the U.S. and opened four stores in Mexico. As of February 9, 2008, the Company had 4,000 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 128 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a conference call this morning, Tuesday, February 26, 2008, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss the second quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-1211 through Tuesday, March 4, 2008 at 11:59 p.m. (EST).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying recon ciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results.

The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to ongoing category management efforts and supply chain efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher shrink expense. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 32.2% (versus 31.9% last year). Higher occupancy costs versus last year were the primary contributor to the increase in comparable operating expenses.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.4% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of May 3, 2008, was $508 thousand versus $504 thousand last year, an increase of 0.8%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $56 thousand from $73 thousand last year.
AutoZone did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the third quarter. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. For the fiscal year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350 million.
"I would like to thank all our AutoZoners across North America for their ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth, despite a challenging macro environment that included record high gas prices. We continue to refine our retail offering as evidenced by our improved customer satisfaction survey results, and our efforts to enhance our commercial offerings were rewarded by the highest quarterly commercial sales growth since our third quarter of fiscal 2004. As our operating model remains strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 3, 2008, AutoZone opened 32 new stores and replaced three stores in the U.S. and opened two stores in Mexico. As of May 3, 2008, the Company had 4,032 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 130 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations.

Item 1.01.           Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
 
On June 25, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") and ESL Investments, Inc. entered into an Agreement (the "Agreement"), setting forth certain understandings and agreements regarding the voting by ESL Investments, Inc., on behalf of itself and its affiliates (collectively, "ESL"), of certain shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") and related matters. As of June 24, 2008, ESL was the beneficial holder of 22,928,783 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 36.2% of the outstanding Common Stock.  The Agreement was announced by press release issued by the Company on June 26, 2008.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, ESL has agreed to vote all shares of Common Stock owned by ESL in excess of certain thresholds (whether as a result of share repurchases by the Company or additional purchases of shares by ESL) on matters proposed from time to time for a stockholder vote, in the same proportion as shares not owned by ESL are actually voted. For an initial period ending after the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company held to elect directors following the conclusion of the Company's fiscal year ending on August 29, 2009, the applicable percentage threshold is 40% of the then outstanding Common Stock.  Thereafter, so long as the Agreement remains in effect, the applicable percentage threshold is 37.5%.  Shares owned by ESL under the applicable threshold have no voting limitations.  As part of the Agreement, the Company has agreed not to take actions, including the adoption of a stockholder rights plan, to prevent future purchase of Company shares by ESL.
 
In the Agreement, ESL has also agreed, among other things, that ESL generally will not dispose or agree to dispose of any shares of Common Stock to a third party at a price above the then prevailing market price per share, without taking appropriate steps to ensure that the purchaser of such shares simultaneously provides all other holders of Common Stock with an opportunity to dispose of a number of shares (representing, for each Company stockholder, the same proportion of owned shares of Common Stock as ESL proposes to dispose of) in such transaction on the same terms and conditions, including price per share, as ESL. In addition, ESL has agreed that it would not pursue in the future a transaction resulting in the acquisition of all or substantially all of the shares of Common Stock not owned by ESL, without following certain procedures, including consideration and recommendation of the transaction by a committee of independent, disinterested directors unaffiliated with ESL, unless the transaction is structured as tender offer meeting certain requirements, followed by a merger at the same price if the tender offer is successful.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company has agreed to take appropriate actions, once candidates are identified, to add three new members to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").  As reflected in the Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that such additions shall occur as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company held to elect directors following the conclusion of the Companys fiscal year ending on August 30, 2008. One candidate, reasonably acceptable to ESL, will be identified by an independent search agency retained by the Company pursuant to a previously initiated search.  Two additional directors will be appointed from candidates identified by ESL,
 
 
 
including candidates who are reasonably acceptable to ESL suggested by other directors of the Company.  These two candidates may, at ESL's discretion, be officers of ESL and its affiliated investment entities.  All three candidates must be reasonably acceptable to both ESL and a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and be "independent" under the Company's corporate governance principles and the rules of the NYSE.
 
Following the addition of these new directors, the size of the Board will increase to 12, although after considering, among other things,  ESL's views regarding the size of the Board, it is the Company's expectation that the Board's size would be reduced to 10 at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The changes in the membership of the Board to achieve the reduction would be reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in connection with the addition of the new directors and recommended to the Board.  During the negotiations regarding the Agreement, ESL shared its perspective that three of the current directors, the Chairman, Earl G. Graves, Jr. and Theodore W. Ullyot, be included among the directors re-nominated at the 2008 Annual Meeting.
 
The Company has also agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to achieve, no later than February 14, 2009, the last day of the Company's second quarter of the Company's 2009 fiscal year, an adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio (as such term is used in the Company's quarterly earnings report) of at least 2.5:1. If the Company has not achieved the targeted adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio referenced above by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, the voting limitations described in the second paragraph of this Item 1.01 will be suspended until such time as the targeted adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio is achieved.
 
The Agreement, by its terms, will continue in effect until the earliest of (a) the date upon which the shares of Common Stock owned by ESL, in the aggregate, constitute less than 25% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (b) the date upon which the shares of Common Stock owned by ESL exceeds 50% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, that ESL has acquired subsequent to the date of the Agreement additional shares representing above 10% of the then outstanding shares and (c) the date upon which the parties (which, in the case of the Company, have been authorized by at least two directors representing a majority of the independent and disinterested members of the Board unaffiliated with ESL) mutually agree in writing that this Agreement and all of its provisions shall no longer be in effect. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (b) above shall not affect ESL's obligations described under the third paragraph in this Item 1.01.

(b)         Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(b), ESL shall, at each Stockholders' Meeting and in connection with the execution of each Stockholders' Consent, vote all Additional Shares on all matters proposed in the same proportion as Unaffiliated Shares are actually voted (it being understood that, in connection with any action by written consent, shares not consenting shall be treated as shares voted against such action).
 
Section 2.2     
Irrevocable Proxy
.
 
(a)         Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(b), as security for ESL's obligations under Section 2.1 of this Agreement, ESL hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Company (acting through the CEO, CFO, General Counsel or such other persons so designated by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") from time to time) as its attorney and proxy in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, to cause the Additional Shares to be counted as present at any Stockholders' Meeting, to vote the Additional Shares at any Stockholders' Meeting, and to execute any Stockholders' Consent in respect of the Additional Shares as and to the extent provided in Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement. The powers granted in this Section 2.2 shall also entitle the Company to give instructions to any nominee through whom ESL may hold Shares. ESL shall from time to time provide the Company with any nominee information that the Company may require to exercise its rights hereunder. ESL hereby revokes all other proxies and powers of attorney with respect to the Subject Shares that it may have previously appointed or granted and represents that any proxies previously given in respect of the Subject Shares, if any, are revocable.
 
(b)         Upon the failure of ESL to comply with its obligations under Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, ESL hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Company (acting through the CEO, CFO, General Counsel or such other persons so designated by the Board from time to time) as its attorney and proxy in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, to cause the Subject Shares (excluding the Additional Shares) to be counted as present at any Stockholders' Meeting as and to the extent provided in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, but such shares (, the Subject Shares excluding the Additional Shares) may not otherwise be voted by the Company.

ESL hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and, except as set forth in this Section 2.2 or in Section 8.1 of this Agreement, is intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 78.355 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

Section 3.1     
New Directors
. In accordance with the provisions of this Article III, the Company shall take appropriate actions, once nominees are identified satisfying the requirements of Section 3.2, to add three (3) new members to the Board (the "New Directors").

Section 3.2    
Selection of New Directors
.
 
(a)         An independent search agency has been engaged to identify a nominee for one (1) of the New Director positions (the "Specified Director") pursuant to criteria previously determined by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and all of the directors shall be permitted to propose persons as suggested candidates for the Specified Director to such independent search agency. A candidate identified shall be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with its regular policies and procedures, which shall include, without limitation, consideration of such candidate's background, competencies and experience.  A candidate shall be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as a nominee for election by the Board as the Specified Director only if he or she is (a) deemed to be "independent" pursuant to the Company's corporate governance principles and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange and (b) reasonably acceptable to both ESL and a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Only a nominee who is recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall be presented to the Board as a potential nominee for election as the Specified Director.
 
(b)         Two (2) New Directors (the "Non-Specified Directors") shall be appointed from nominees identified by ESL, including persons suggested by other directors to ESL who are reasonably acceptable to ESL (any such person, a "Candidate"). Each Candidate identified shall be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in

accordance with its regular policies and procedures, which shall include, without limitation, consideration of such Candidate's background, competencies, experience and affiliation with ESL (if any). Only candidates which are reasonably acceptable to both ESL and a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for election to the Board. Either or both of the two Candidates may, at ESL's discretion, be an officer of ESL and its affiliated investment entities. Each candidate shall qualify as "independent" pursuant to the Company's corporate governance principles and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  promptly recommend Candidates for election to the Board once candidates are identified satisfying the requirements above.
 
 
(c)         Subject to the nomination of directors in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(a) and 3.2(b), the Company's Board of Directors shall promptly take all action required to cause the Specified Director and Non-Specified Directors to be so elected.

Section 6.3    .
Future Sales and/or Transacti

Company
 
(a)           ESL shall not dispose or agree to dispose of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing), including by way of merger or other business combination, at a price above the market price per share prevailing at the time of such agreement, arrangement or understanding, without taking appropriate steps to ensure that the purchaser of such shares simultaneously provides all other holders of Common Stock with an opportunity to dispose of a number of shares (representing, for each Company stockholder, the same proportion of owned shares of Common Stock as ESL proposes to dispose of) in such transaction on the same terms and conditions, including price per share, as ESL. It is understood that (i) sales in the open market shall be deemed to be at prevailing market prices and (ii) (a) the transfer of Shares of Common Stock from one ESL affiliate subject to this Agreement to another, (b) distributions by ESL to its shareholders or limited partners, and (c) sales to the Company or third parties approved by at least two directors representing a majority of the independent, disinterested directors unaffiliated with ESL, shall not constitute a disposition subject to this Section 6.3(a).
 
(b)           ESL shall not pursue, either directly or indirectly, including as part of a group, a transaction resulting in the acquisition of all or substantially all of the shares of Common Stock not owned by ESL or by such group (including, for example, in a leveraged recap in which "stub equity" is left in the hands of some or all of the non-ESL stockholders) unless the following procedures and requirements are followed and satisfied. The Board shall establish a committee of independent, disinterested directors unaffiliated with ESL (the "Special Committee") to review and evaluate any transaction (other than any such transaction in which ESL would be treated on the same basis as all other Company stockholders) proposed by ESL or in which ESL intends to participate, with full authority to negotiate and recommend the terms of
 
 
7
 
such a transaction on behalf of the Company and the non-ESL stockholders. ESL will proceed only with a transaction recommended by the Special Committee, unless the acquisition is structured as a "non-coercive" tender offer, followed by a merger at the same price if the offer is successful, not subject to the test of "entire fairness" in accordance with applicable Delaware case law (, the decisions involving Silconix and Pure Resources), assuming, for these purposes, that the Company had been incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and was subject to Delaware law.
e.g.
 
 
(c)           The provisions of this Section 6.3 may be enforced by any directors constituting a majority of the independent, disinterested directors unaffiliated with ESL or, in the absence of any such persons sitting on the Board, through a derivative action.

News
For immediate release
 
 
 
 
Memphis, Tenn (June 26, 2008) - AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the Companys stock, bringing its current unused repurchase authorization to $608 million.  Including the additional authorization, the cumulative share repurchase authorization approved by its Board since 1998 totals $6.4 billion.
 
Additionally, as part of the Companys ongoing evaluation of its capital structure, the Company has decided to increase its adjusted debt / EBITDAR leverage metric to at least  2.5x from the previously established 2.1x.  The Company believes this will better optimize its current capital structure and also reflect the ongoing strength of its free cash flow generation.
 
AutoZone also announced that it has entered into an agreement with ESL Investments, Inc. (with its affiliates, "ESL") setting forth certain understandings and agreements concerning ESLs continued investment in AutoZone.  ESL currently owns approximately 36.2% of the outstanding AutoZone common stock.  Pursuant to the agreement with ESL, the Company has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to achieve at least the new 2.5x adjusted debt / EBITDAR leverage metric by the end of the Companys second quarter fiscal 2009.
 
We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with our long-term and significant stockholder, ESL, which was motivated by our desire to continue to return excess capital to stockholders in the context of appropriate, mutually agreed governance arrangements, said Bill Rhodes AutoZones Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. We appreciate ESL's belief in the Company and its management over the past eleven years and look forward to its continued involvement in helping us achieve our goals for the benefit of all stockholders.
 
The agreement with ESL provides, among other things, that, should ESL's percentage ownership of Company shares increase above certain thresholds, ESL will vote its shares owned above such thresholds in the same proportion as shares unaffiliated with ESL are actually voted.  The initial threshold is 40%, which will reduce to 37.5% following the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders.  The agreement also states the Company's intention to add three directors in the near future, two of whom will be identified by ESL for consideration by the Companys Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, thereby increasing the Board's size to 12
 
 
 
members.  Thereafter, the Company expects to reduce the Board's size to 10 members in conjunction with the 2008 annual meeting in December.  The agreement also contains certain other protections for non-ESL affiliated shareholders as well as for ESL.
The agreement with ESL or certain of its provisions will terminate, except as the parties otherwise mutually agree, upon the earlier of the date upon which the shares (a) owned by ESL constitute less than 25% of the then outstanding shares or (b) owned by ESL constitute more than 50% of the then outstanding shares, provided that ESL has acquired subsequent to the date of the agreement additional shares representing above 10% of the then outstanding shares.
 
Additional details and a copy of the agreement with ESL will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.

Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Securities shall be made at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022 or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative and the Company, at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on August 4, 2008, or such other time not later than August 4, 2008, as shall be agreed upon by the Representative and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called "Closing Time").
Payment
     Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company, against delivery to the Representative for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Securities to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representative, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase. The Representative, individually and not as representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.
     (d) . The Securities or certificates for the Securities, as applicable, shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Representative may request in writing at least one full business day prior to the Closing Time. The Securities or certificates for the Securities, as applicable, will be made available for examination and packaging by the Representative in The City of New York not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the business day prior to the Closing Time.

Compliance with Securities Regulations and Commission Requests
 
and (v) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Securities. The Company will promptly effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
     (b) . The Company will give the Representative notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representative with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representative or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. The Company has given the Representative notice of any filings made pursuant to the 1934 Act or 1934 Act Regulations within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Representative notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and will furnish the Representative with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Representative or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative and substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representative with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representative or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. To the extent the distribution of Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representative with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act.
Filing of Amendments and Exchange Act Documents; Preparation of Final Term Sheet
     (c) . The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representative and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representative, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters. The Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
Delivery of Registration Statement
     (d) . The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may
Delivery of Prospectuses
 
reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
     (e) . The Company will comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement, to file a new registration statement, or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, (ii) use its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities), and (iii) furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representative and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
     (f) . The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign

corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.

     (g) . The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.

     (i) . During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the Closing Time, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representative, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer or contract to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities of the Company or warrants to purchase debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Securities (other than (i) the Securities or (ii) commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business).
Restriction on Sale of Securities
     (j) . The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
Reporting Requirements
     (k) . The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representative, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representative, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
     (m) . If at any time when Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representative, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Representative, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representative of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action reasonably necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

Indemnification
     (a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
 
make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
Contribution
 
provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate
 
principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
               SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery

Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
          SECTION 11. .

Underwriting Agreement
     As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter, except where a specific fact confirmation procedure is stated to have been performed (in which case we have with your consent performed the stated procedure). We have examined, among other things, the following:
 
     As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement. We have not independently verified such factual matters.
     We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States and the internal laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Various matters concerning the laws of the State of Nevada are addressed in the opinion of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, and various matters concerning the Company are addressed in the opinion of Harry L. Goldsmith, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, each of which have been separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters. Our opinions set forth herein are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to underwritten public offerings of debt securities, provided that no opinion is expressed herein with respect to federal securities laws (except to the extent stated in paragraphs 4, 6 and 7), state securities laws, tax laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws or antifraud laws.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
1. The Indenture is the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2. The Notes, when executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by you in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
3. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and delivery of the Notes by the Company to you and the other Underwriters pursuant to the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the Notes on the date hereof do not:
4. The Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement that became effective under the Act upon filing with the Commission. Based solely on a telephonic confirmation by a member of the Staff of the Commission on August 4, 2008, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings therefor have been initiated by the Commission. Any required filing of the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act has been made in accordance with Rule 424 under the Act.
5. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "").
TIA
6. The Registration Statement, as of the date it was declared effective, and the Prospectus, as of its dates, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements for registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act, the TIA, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that we express no opinion with respect to Regulation S-T or the financial statements or other financial data, included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we have assumed that the statements made therein are correct and complete.
7. Each of the Incorporated Documents, as of its respective filing or effective date, complied as to form in all material respects with the respective applicable requirements for reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and for proxy statements under Regulation 14A, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that we express no opinion with respect to Regulation S-T or the financial statements or other financial data, included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from such reports or proxy statements. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Incorporated Documents, we have assumed that the statements made therein are correct and complete.
 
8. The statements in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as they purport to describe or summarize certain provisions of the Notes or the Indenture, are accurate summaries or descriptions in all material respects.
9. Based solely on a certificate of an officer of the Company as to factual matters, the Company is not, and immediately after giving effect to the sale of the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement and the application of the proceeds as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds," will not be required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In rendering the opinions in clause (a) of paragraph 3 above insofar as they require interpretation of the Material Agreements, with your consent, (i) we have assumed that courts of competent jurisdiction would enforce such agreements in accordance with their plain meaning, (ii) to the extent that any questions of legality or legal construction have arisen in connection with our review, we have applied the laws of the State of New York in resolving such questions, (iii) we express no opinion with respect to the effect of any action or inaction (other than the issuance and delivery of the Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and performance of the Indenture and the Notes on the date hereof) by the Company under the Material Agreements that may result in a breach or default under any Material Agreement, and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to any matters which would require us to perform a mathematical calculation or make a financial or accounting determination. Because certain of the Material Agreements may be governed by other than New York law, this opinion may not be relied upon as to whether a breach or default would occur under the law actually governing such Material Agreements.
     The opinions rendered in paragraphs 1 and 2 above relating to the enforceability of the Indenture and the Notes, respectively, are subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), including without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought; (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; (iv) we express no opinion concerning the enforceability of the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 5.6 of the Indenture; (v) the unenforceability of any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy; and (vi) we express no opinion with respect to whether an acceleration of the Notes may affect the collectibility of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof in excess of the public offering price ([___]% of the principal amount per Note) to the extent that such portion were determined to constitute unearned interest thereon.
 
     With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion that (i) each of the Company and the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) each of the Company and the Trustee has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under each of the Indenture and the Notes; (iii) each of the Company and the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Indenture and the Notes (except that no such assumption is made with respect to execution and delivery thereof by the Company under the laws of the State of New York); (iv) each of the Indenture and the Notes constitutes a legally valid and binding agreement of the Trustee, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; and (v) the Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as Trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations. We express no opinion as to any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the subject transaction because of the nature or extent of the business of any parties (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) to the Indenture, the Notes or the Underwriting Agreement.
     This letter is furnished only to you in your capacity as representatives of the several Underwriters in their capacity as underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This letter may not be relied upon by you or them for any other purpose, or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity for any purpose (including any person, firm or other entity that acquires the Notes from you or the other Underwriters) without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in our sole discretion.

As representative of the several Underwriters
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     I am Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), and am familiar with its legal affairs. I am, or other attorneys under my supervision are, also familiar with the sale to you of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of ___% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of [___]% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes"; and together with the 2014 Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2008 (File No. 333-152592) (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), the "Registration Statement"), a Prospectus dated July 29, 2008 (the "Base Prospectus"), Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated July 29, 2008, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (together with the Base Prospectus (but excluding the Incorporated Documents), the "Preliminary Prospectus"), the document that the Company has identified to us as an "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rules 433 and 405 under the Act) and that is identified on attached hereto (the "Specified IFWP"), a Prospectus Supplement dated July 29, 2008, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), and an Underwriting Agreement dated July 29, 2008, between you and the Company (the "Underwriting Agreement"). This opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.

Exhibit A
     All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
     I, or attorneys under my supervision, have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
 
submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, I have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of attorneys under my direction, officers and other representatives of the Company and others. In addition, I have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from public officials as I have deemed necessary.
     Whenever a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that I do not, nor any attorney under my supervision, have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof:
     (1) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (2) Each Subsidiary has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or partnership or equity interest of each Subsidiary has been duly authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and, to the best of my knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries (with the exception of the preferred stock of AutoZone Development Corporation of which the Company owns, directly and indirectly, 1,086 shares and others own 114 shares), free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock or partnership interest of any Subsidiary was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of such Subsidiary.
     (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     (4) The Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (as supplemented by the officers' certificates dated as of August 4, 2008, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A. has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
     (5) To the best of my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its charter or bylaws and no default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries exists in the due performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that is described or referred to in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
     (6) The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds" and compliance by the Company with its obligations thereunder do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or repayment event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to me, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) result in any violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to me, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations, except in the case of clauses (i) or (iii) for such conflicts, creations, impositions or violations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (7) To the best of my knowledge, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, before or by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
     (8) All descriptions in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are a party are accurate in all material respects. To the best of my knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects.
 
     (9) To the best of my knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus that are not described as required.
     My opinion herein is limited to the effect on the subject transaction of the laws of the State of Tennessee. I assume no responsibility regarding the applicability to, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state, and I express no opinion herein concerning any federal law, including any federal securities law (except to the extent set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 herein and except for the statement set forth in the penultimate paragraph hereof), or any state securities law. My opinions set forth in paragraph 6 above are based upon my consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to underwritten public offerings of debt securities. In rendering the opinion in paragraph 8 as to the description in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are a party (the "Opinion Documents"), I have assumed that Tennessee internal law governs the Opinion Documents and I express no opinion concerning the enforceability of any choice of law provisions in the Opinion Documents under any law. Finally, I have not independently verified and I assume no responsibility for differences which may exist between Tennessee law and the law of any other jurisdiction which may govern the Opinion Documents, or the extent to which any such differences may impact adversely the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Opinion Documents.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
     On August 4, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") entered into two Officers' Certificates (the "Officers' Certificates"), pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, in connection with the offer and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.500% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.125% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes," and collectively with the 2014 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2008, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152592) (the "Registration Statement").
     The Company will pay interest on the 2014 Notes on January 15 and July 15 each year, beginning January 15, 2009, and will pay interest on the 2018 Notes on February 1 and August 1 each year, beginning February 1, 2009. The 2014 Notes will mature on January 15, 2014 and the 2018 Notes will mature on August 1, 2018. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person.
     The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the indenture. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificates, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificates. The interest rate payable on the Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if the rating assigned to the Notes is downgraded (or subsequently upgraded), as set forth in the Officers' Certificates.
     The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Officers' Certificates pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes and the form of notes representing each of the 2014 Notes and the 2018 Notes, each of which is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 4.1
     A. Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted on June 21, 2008 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Charlie Pleas, III, Senior Vice President and Controller, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
          (a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "6.500% Senior Notes due 2014" (the "2014 Notes").
          (b) The 2014 Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.991% of the principal amount thereof.
          (c) The aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for 2014 Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other 2014 Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the 2014 Notes, create and issue additional 2014 Notes ranking equally and ratably with the 2014 Notes and otherwise identical to the 2014 Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional 2014 Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional 2014 Notes, so that such further 2014 Notes shall form a single series with the 2014 Notes.
          (d) The principal amount of the 2014 Notes shall be payable in full on January 15, 2014, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
          (e) The 2014 Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 6.500% per annum (unless such rate is adjusted pursuant to clause (o) hereof) from August 4, 2008, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on January 15, 2009, until the principal amount of the 2014 Notes has been paid or duly provided for. January 15 and July 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
          (f) The principal of and interest on the 2014 Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
          (g) The 2014 Notes will be redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such 2014 Notes; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments
 
of principal and interest on such 2014 Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the 2014 Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such 2014 Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and their respective successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City the Company shall select (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
          (h) The 2014 Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
          (i) The 2014 Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The initial Depositary for such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company.
          (j) The 2014 Notes shall be denominated in Dollars and the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on the 2014 Notes shall be in Dollars.
          (k) The 2014 Notes shall be defeasible as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.
          (l) The 2014 Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory sinking fund.
 
          (m) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the 2014 Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the 2014 Notes as described in Section 4.2 of the Indenture and clause (A)(g) of this Officers' Certificate, Holders of 2014 Notes shall have the right to require the Company to make an offer to each Holder of 2014 Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's 2014 Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth in the 2014 Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the 2014 Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to Holders of 2014 Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the 2014 Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the 2014 Notes and described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the 2014 Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

     If at any time the interest rate on the 2014 Notes has been adjusted upward and any of the Rating Agencies subsequently increases its rating of the 2014 Notes, the interest rate on the 2014 Notes will again be adjusted (and decreased, if appropriate) such that the interest rate on the 2014 Notes equals the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2014 Notes prior to any adjustment plus (if applicable) an amount equal to the sum of the percentages set forth opposite the ratings in the tables above with respect to the two lowest ratings assigned to the 2014 Notes (or deemed assigned) at that time, all calculated in accordance with the rules of interpretation set forth below.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
     For purposes of making adjustments to the interest rate payable on the 2014 Notes, the following rules of interpretation will apply:
          (i) if a Rating Agency has ceased to provide a rating of the 2014 Notes for any reason, that Rating Agency will be deemed to have rated the 2014 Notes at the lowest level contemplated by the table above;
          (ii) if only one of the three Rating Agencies ceases to provide a rating of the 2014 Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of that Rating Agency will be disregarded for purposes of all interest rate adjustments;
          (iii) if two of the three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the 2014 Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of only one of such two Rating Agencies will be disregarded;
          (iv) if all three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the 2014 Notes for any reason, the interest rate on the 2014 Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2014 Notes prior to any adjustment;
          (v) each interest rate adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating by any one Rating Agency will be made independently of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments; and
          (vi) in no event will (A) the per annum interest rate on the 2014 Notes be reduced to below the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2014 Notes prior to any adjustment or (B) the total increase in the interest rate on the 2014 Notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2014 Notes prior to any adjustment.
     Promptly after any change in the interest rate on the 2014 Notes as provided above, the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing that (i) the effective date the interest rate on
 
the 2014 Notes has changed in accordance with this Section A.(o); (ii) the amount of the related increase or decrease; and (iii) the new interest rate on the 2014 Notes.
     The interest rate on the 2014 Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the 2014 Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's, "A" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P and "A" (or its equivalent) by Fitch, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
     "Rating Agency" means each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P.
          (p) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person more than 180 days following the Company's or its Subsidiary's acquisition of such Property, with the intention of taking back a lease of such Property (a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the terms of such sale or transfer have been determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and arm's length and either:
          (i) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value of such Property at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
          (ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the 2014 Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
     The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.
     "Attributable Debt" in respect of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction means, at the time of determination, the present value discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the terms of the lease (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the obligations of the lessee under such lease for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease (including any period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the Company's option, be extended).
     "Funded Debt" means debt which matures more than one year from the date of creation, or which is extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor so that it may become payable more than one year from such date or which is classified, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet for the most recently ended fiscal quarter (or if incurred subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, would have been so classified) of the person for which the determination is being made. Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.
 
     "Senior Funded Debt" means all Funded Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries (except Funded Debt, the payment of which is subordinated to the payment of the 2014 Notes).
          (q) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on July 29, 2008, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
          (r) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:

          (s) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
          (t) The 2014 Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.
          (u) The 2014 Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
          (v) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
          (w) The 2014 Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
          (x) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the 2014 Notes.

     This Officers' Certificate may be executed in one or more counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and shall together constitute one and the same Officers' Certificate.

          (ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all 2018 Notes or portions of 2018 Notes properly tendered; and
          (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the 2018 Notes properly accepted together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes or portions of 2018 Notes being repurchased.
     The paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder of 2018 Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the 2018 Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any 2018 Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all 2018 Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any 2018 Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          (o) If the rating of the 2018 Notes from any one or more of the three Rating Agencies is decreased to a rating set forth in any of the immediately following tables, the interest rate on the 2018 Notes will increase from the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2018 Notes by an amount equal to the sum of the percentages set forth in the following tables opposite those ratings; provided, that only the two lowest ratings assigned to the 2018 Notes (or deemed assigned, as provided in the rules of interpretation set forth below) will be taken into account for purposes of any interest rate adjustment:
 
     If at any time the interest rate on the 2018 Notes has been adjusted upward and any of the Rating Agencies subsequently increases its rating of the 2018 Notes, the interest rate on the 2018 Notes will again be adjusted (and decreased, if appropriate) such that the interest rate on the 2018 Notes equals the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2018 Notes prior to any adjustment plus (if applicable) an amount equal to the sum of the percentages set forth opposite the ratings in the tables above with respect to the two lowest ratings assigned to the 2018 Notes (or deemed assigned) at that time, all calculated in accordance with the rules of interpretation set forth below.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
     For purposes of making adjustments to the interest rate payable on the 2018 Notes, the following rules of interpretation will apply:
          (i) if a Rating Agency has ceased to provide a rating of the 2018 Notes for any reason, that Rating Agency will be deemed to have rated the 2018 Notes at the lowest level contemplated by the table above;
          (ii) if only one of the three Rating Agencies ceases to provide a rating of the 2018 Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of that Rating Agency will be disregarded for purposes of all interest rate adjustments;
          (iii) if two of the three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the 2018 Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of only one of such two Rating Agencies will be disregarded;
          (iv) if all three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the 2018 Notes for any reason, the interest rate on the 2018 Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2018 Notes prior to any adjustment;
          (v) each interest rate adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating by any one Rating Agency will be made independently of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments; and
          (vi) in no event will (A) the per annum interest rate on the 2018 Notes be reduced to below the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2018 Notes prior to any adjustment or (B) the total increase in the interest rate on the 2018 Notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the 2018 Notes prior to any adjustment.
     Promptly after any change in the interest rate on the 2018 Notes as provided above, the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing that (i) the effective date the interest rate on
 
the 2018 Notes has changed in accordance with this Section A.(o); (ii) the amount of the related increase or decrease; and (iii) the new interest rate on the 2018 Notes.
     The interest rate on the 2018 Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the 2018 Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's, "A" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P and "A" (or its equivalent) by Fitch, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
     "Rating Agency" means each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P.
          (p) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person more than 180 days following the Company's or its Subsidiary's acquisition of such Property, with the intention of taking back a lease of such Property (a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the terms of such sale or transfer have been determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and arm's length and either:
          (i) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value of such Property at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
          (ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the 2018 Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
     The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.
     "Attributable Debt" in respect of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction means, at the time of determination, the present value discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the terms of the lease (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the obligations of the lessee under such lease for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease (including any period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the Company's option, be extended).
     "Funded Debt" means debt which matures more than one year from the date of creation, or which is extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor so that it may become payable more than one year from such date or which is classified, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet for the most recently ended fiscal quarter (or if incurred subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, would have been so classified) of the person for which the determination is being made. Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.
 
     "Senior Funded Debt" means all Funded Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries (except Funded Debt, the payment of which is subordinated to the payment of the 2018 Notes).
          (q) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on July 29, 2008, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
          (r) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xviii) other Liens on Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing debt having an aggregate principal amount (or deemed amount, in the case of Attributable Debt) not to exceed, as of any date of incurrence of such secured debt pursuant to this clause and after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the greater of (1) $500 million and (2) 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
          (s) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
          (t) The 2018 Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.
          (u) The 2018 Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
          (v) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
          (w) The 2018 Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
          (x) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the 2018 Notes.
     B. The undersigned hereby approve the sale of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes by the Company to the Underwriters, in accordance with and pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a net purchase price to the Company of 98.900% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from August 4, 2008, and with an initial price to the public of 99.550% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from August 4, 2008.
     The Indenture, as supplemented by this Officers' Certificate, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Officers' Certificate shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.
     This Officers' Certificate may be executed in one or more counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and shall together constitute one and the same Officers' Certificate.
 
     THIS OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto executed this Officers' Certificate as of the 4 day of August, 2008.

     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
     If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date.

     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authorized and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "6.500% Senior Notes due 2014" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
     The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
     The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted
 
to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and their respective successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day before the date of redemption.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
provided
however
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
 
satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
     THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
     All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and their respective successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day before the date of redemption.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 22, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended August 30, 2008, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)     Exhibits
99.1     Press Release dated September 22, 2008.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 19, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.2 billion for its fourth quarter (17 weeks) ended August 30, 2008, an increase of 10.4% from fiscal fourth quarter 2007 (16 weeks). Excluding sales from the additional week included in this year's quarter, sales were up 4.1%. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 0.6% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 12.2% over the same period last year to $243.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 20.1% to $3.88 per share from $3.23 per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the additional week, net income for the quarter increased 5.0% over the previous year's quarter to $227.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 12.4% to $3.63 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 50.1% last year). The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by category management efforts, partially offset by higher shrink expense and increased distribution expense relating to higher fuel costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.4% (versus 31.3% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to higher employee medical expense and fuel expense for our commercial fleet.
For the fiscal year ended August 30, 2008, sales were $6.5 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 0.4%. Operating profit increased 6.5% on an operating margin of 17.2%. For fiscal 2008, net income increased 7.7% to $642 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 17.8% to $10.04 from $8.53. Excluding results from the additional week, sales increased 3.7% from the prior year, and operating profit increased 4.0% on an operating margin of 17.1%. Net income, excluding the extra week, increased 5.1% to $626 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14.9% to $9.80.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock for $499 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $128 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 6.8 million shares of its common stock for $849 million, at an average price of $125 per share.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 7.1% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $509 thousand versus $500 thousand last year, an increase of 1.6%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $25 thousand from $34 thousand last year.
"I would like to thank our entire organization for the solid performance delivered this past quarter. We are pleased to report our eighth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth, particularly in light of the challenging macro environment. For the year, we reached many new milestones which included exceeding $6.5 billion in sales. We also improved our return on invested capital, achieving 24.0% at year end. While our same store sales performance accelerated slightly from last quarter, it did not meet our aspirations. We continue to believe we have the right plans in place and we will continue to focus intensely on executing our plans. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 60 new stores and replaced six stores in the U.S. and opened 18 stores in Mexico. As of August 30, 2008, the Company had 4,092 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 148 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of thi s additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 9, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 22, 2008, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)   Exhibits
       99.1       Press Release dated December 9, 2008.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1       Press Release dated December 9, 2008.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 8, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 22, 2008, an increase of 1.6 % from fiscal first quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 1.5% for the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter increased $1.2 million, or 0.5%, over the same period last year to $238.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 10.1% to $2.23 per share from $2.02 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.1% (versus 49.9% last year). The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by category management efforts. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.0% (versus 33.6% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs and self insurance expenses versus last year.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $272 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $122 per share. The Company has $337 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.6% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $513 thousand versus $507 thousand last year, an increase of 1.3%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $43 thousand from $50 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our ninth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. In this challenging macro economic environment, growing operating income is difficult, but through the dedication and commitment of our 57,000+ AutoZoners across North America, we were able to accomplish this goal. We were disappointed with our sales performance early in the quarter, as we were impacted by the disruption caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Beginning in October, our sales were more consistent with recent quarterly performance. Despite the challenges in the broader economy, we remain committed to our long range plans and believe the ultimate determinant of our success will be our strategies and our execution of those strategies. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 30 new stores and replaced two stores in the U.S. and opened two stores in Mexico. As of November 22, 2008, the Company had 4,122 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 150 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of thi s additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.

Goldsmith, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary dated as of August 31, 1999, and (b) Robert D. Olsen, Executive Vice President, Store Operations, Commercial and Mexico dated November 9, 2000 (collectively, the Employment Agreements), to bring the Employment Agreements into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Section 409A).
Prior to the amendments, the Employment Agreements provided, among other things, that if the Company terminated the agreements without cause, the executive would remain an employee of the Company on leave of absence during a defined Continuation Period and would continue to receive his then-current salary and other benefits of an employee, a prorated bonus for the fiscal year in which he was terminated, and his stock options would continue to vest and could be exercised in accordance with the respective stock option agreements until the end of the Continuation Period, after which further stock option exercises and vesting would be governed by the terms of the respective stock option agreements.
As amended, the Employment Agreements provide that the executives employment status will end if the Companys termination of the agreements without cause results in a separation from service as defined in Section 409A, and the executive will receive severance benefits which are substantially similar to those provided under the original Employment Agreements, but which will be delivered in a manner that is compliant with Section 409A.
The above summary of the amendments to the Employment Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual amended and restated Employment Agreements, which are included as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, of this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

If the Employee experiences a separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) () due to the Employees termination by AutoZone without Cause then AutoZone shall promptly pay or provide to the Employee:
Separation from Service

(ii) To the extent that the Employee has unvested stock options that would have otherwise vested during the Continuation Period had Employee not experienced a Separation from Service (the ), the vesting of such Subject Stock Options shall accelerate and such Subject Stock Options shall become fully vested on the Termination Date. The Subject Stock Options and all other stock options held by the Employee that vested on or before the Termination Date may be exercised in the manner set forth in the respective stock option agreements until the earlier of the 30 days following the end of the Continuation Period or the maximum term of the respective stock option agreement, without regard to any possible early expiration resulting from the Employees termination of employment. Notwithstanding, the Employees termination of employment pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered a Termination of Employment pursuant to any stock option agreement for any stock option that would vest during the Continuation Period to cause such stock option to terminate;
Subject Stock Options
(iii) Continuation of medical, dental and vision benefit coverage under a group health plan of AutoZone for the benefit of the Employee and/or the Employees dependents, for the period beginning on the Termination Date and equal to the sum of (1) the Continuation Period and (2) the period during which the Employee was entitled to elect COBRA coverage as of the Termination Date, initially pursuant to Employees COBRA election until the expiration of the maximum COBRA period applicable to Employee;
(iv) Pay to the Employee a lump-sum amount equal, as determined by AutoZone, to three times the total aggregate annual COBRA premium costs for group medical, dental and vision benefit coverage for the Employee and the Employees spouse and dependents, in each case, as in effect with respect to each such individual immediately prior to such Separation from Service, which lump-sum payment shall be made six (6) months after the Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment described in this Paragraph 8(a)(iv) shall be subject to withholding of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which AutoZone is required to withhold; and
(v) During the Continuation Period, Employee shall not earn any bonus payments. AutoZone shall pay Employee a prorated bonus for the fiscal year which includes the Termination Date calculated based on the period of time elapsed during such fiscal year until the Termination Date and the formula established by the Compensation Committee for officers for that fiscal year. Said bonus shall be paid when other officer bonuses are paid for that fiscal year, but in no event later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of such fiscal year.
AutoZone shall have no obligations other than those stated herein upon the termination of this Agreement and Employee hereby releases AutoZone from any and all obligations and claims except those as are specifically set forth herein. Each payment under this Paragraph 8(a) shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A (as defined below). To the extent that any reimbursement is received or to be received by Employee, such reimbursements shall be administered consistent with the following additional requirements as set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv): (1) Employees eligibility for benefits in one taxable year will not affect Employees eligibility for benefits in any other taxable year, (2) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be made on or before the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred, and (3) Employees right to benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
(b) WITH CAUSE. AutoZone shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Employees employment with AutoZone for Cause at any time. Upon such termination for Cause, Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation, salary, or bonus and shall immediately cease to receive any benefits (other than those as may be required pursuant to the AutoZone Pension Plan or by law) and any stock options shall be governed by the respective stock option agreements in effect between the Employee and AutoZone at that time. Cause shall mean the willful engagement by the Employee in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to AutoZone, monetarily or otherwise. For this purpose, no act or failure to act by the Employee shall be considered willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of AutoZone.

Competitor
The parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Non-Compete section have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time, scope, geographic area and other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances and are in exchange for the obligations undertaken by AutoZone pursuant to this Agreement.
Further, Employee agrees not to hire, for himself or any other entity, encourage anyone or entity to hire, or entice away from AutoZone any employee of AutoZone during the term of this non-compete obligation.
If at any time a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any portion of this Non-Compete section is unenforceable for any reason, then Employee shall forfeit his right to any further salary, bonus, stock option exercises, or benefits from AutoZone during any Continuation Period. This Paragraph 12 shall not apply to a termination by Employee pursuant to Paragraph 10.
 
(a) . To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with Department of Treasury regulations and other official guidance issued thereunder, ). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that AutoZone determines in good faith that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may not be either exempt from or compliant with Section 409A, AutoZone shall consult with the Employee and adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits payable hereunder, to preserve the economic benefits of such compensation and benefits, and/or (ii) to exempt the compensation and benefits payable hereunder from Section 409A or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; provided, however, that this Paragraph 16 does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of AutoZone to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify the Employee for any failure to do so.
General
Section 409A
 
(b) This Agreement shall be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code, and Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Agreement. The portion of any payment under this Agreement that is paid within the short-term deferral period within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be treated as a short term deferral and not aggregated with other plans or payments. Any other portion of the payment that does not meet the short term deferral requirement shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to satisfy the exception from Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) for involuntary separation pay and shall not be aggregated with any other payment. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Any amount that is paid as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be treated as a separate payment. Payment dates provided for in this Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate grace periods within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no compensation or benefits, including without limitation any severance payments or benefits payable under Paragraph 8 hereof, shall be paid to Employee during the 6-month period following Employees Separation from Service if AutoZone determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Employees death), AutoZone shall pay Employee a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Employee during such period.
This Paragraph 16(c) shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon a Separation from Service which shall qualify as involuntary severance under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executives annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs.

General
Section 409A
provided, however
(b) This Agreement shall be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code, and Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Agreement. The portion of any payment under this Agreement that is paid within the short-term deferral period within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be treated as a short term deferral and not aggregated with other plans or payments. Any other portion of the payment that does not meet the short term deferral requirement shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to satisfy the exception from Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) for involuntary separation pay and shall not be aggregated with any other payment. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Any amount that is paid as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be treated as a separate payment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no compensation or benefits, including without limitation any severance payments or benefits payable under Paragraph 8 hereof, shall be paid to Employee during the 6-month period following Employees Separation from Service if AutoZone determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Employees death), AutoZone shall pay Employee a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Employee during such period.
 
This Paragraph 16(c) shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon a Separation from Service which shall qualify as involuntary severance under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executives annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs.
17. Any waiver of any breach of this Agreement by AutoZone shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Employee. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of AutoZone.
Waiver.

Assignment.
19. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties related to the matters discussed herein. It may not be changed orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, extension, or discharge is sought.
Entire Agreement.
20. This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law rules. The parties agree that the only proper venue for any dispute under this Agreement shall be in the state or federal courts located in Shelby County, Tennessee.
Jurisdiction.
21. Paragraphs 8, 12, 13, 14 and 20 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement or Employees employment with AutoZone (including, without limitation termination pursuant to Paragraphs 8, 9, or 10).

On March 3, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 14, 2009, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d)    Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 3, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.4 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 14, 2009, an increase of 8.1% from fiscal second quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 6.0% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $9.2 million, or 8.6%, over the same period last year to $115.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 21.1% to $2.03 per share from $1.67 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.7% (versus 49.9% last year). Gross margin was negatively impacted by higher than prior year shrink expense of approximately 30 basis points offset in part by lower distribution costs as a percentage of sales due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.9% (versus 35.2% last year). The lower operating expense ratio primarily reflected positive leverage of store operating expenses of approximately 80 basis points due to higher sales volumes and lower promotion costs, offset in part by higher investments in hub store enhancements of approximately 20 basis points, higher medical costs, and an increase in legal costs associated with estimates for minor settlements.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.8 million shares of its common stock for $375 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $133 per share. Year-to-date the Company has purchased $647.2 million of stock, at an average price of $128 per share. The Company has $462 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $511 thousand versus $504 thousand last year, an increase of 1.4%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $50 thousand from $55 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our tenth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. During these challenging economic times, we believe our merchandise and service offerings provide a compelling shopping experience for both our do-it-yourself and professional customers. We remain committed to growing our business through a relentless focus on customer service, continual refinement of our product offerings and ongoing improvements to grow our commercial sales, all while managing our expenses appropriately. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 14, 2009, AutoZone opened 20 new stores and closed one store in the U.S. and opened eight stores in Mexico. As of February 14, 2009, the Company had 4,141 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 158 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 27, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended May 9, 2009, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)    Exhibits
        99.1    Press Release dated May 27, 2009.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 27, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.7 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 9, 2009, an increase of 9.3% from fiscal third quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 7.4% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $15.1 million, or 9.5%, over the same period last year to $173.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 25.9% to $3.13 per share from $2.49 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.2% (versus 50.2% last year). Gross margin benefited by approximately 15 basis points through leverage of distribution costs due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs, but was offset by the impact of promotional activities. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.8% (versus 32.2% last year). The lower operating expense ratio reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales volumes, offset in part by approximately 50 basis points from higher incentive compensation and investments to enhance our hub stores.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 450 thousand shares of its common stock for $65 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $145 per share. Year-to-date the Company has purchased $713 million of stock, at an average price of $130 per share. The Company has $396 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.4% over the same period last year. Inventory per store was $516 thousand versus $506 thousand last year, an increase of 2.0%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $33 thousand from $56 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our eleventh consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to excellence and for their diligence to ensure we meet or exceed our customers' expectations. While the current economic environment, combined with the reduction in fuel prices compared to last year, has clearly been beneficial to our industry's performance, we are very pleased with our organization's ability to capitalize on these favorable trends. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 9, 2009, AutoZone opened 32 new stores, closed one store, and relocated four stores in the U.S. and opened 10 stores in Mexico. As of May 9, 2009, the Company had 4,172 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 168 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation t ables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.

Prior to May 9, 2009, we classified short term debt obligations as long-term as we had the ability and intent to replace these short term obligations with long-term financing under our $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, expiring May 5, 2010. We expect to renegotiate our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter to extend beyond 12 months, at which time we will reclassify these obligations as long term.

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On July 2, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 5.750% per year, payable semi-annually.
     The Notes were sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") dated June 29, 2009 among the Company, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2008, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152592), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated June 29, 2009, filed with the Commission on June 30, 2009. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company entered into an Officers' Certificate (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
     The Company will pay interest on the Notes on January 15 and July 15 each year, beginning January 15, 2010. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
     The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Indenture. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate. The interest rate payable on the Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if the rating assigned to the Notes is downgraded (or subsequently upgraded), as set forth in the Officers' Certificate.
     The above description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, each of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, respectively.

Securities
     (b) . The Company is advised by the Representatives that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after this Agreement has become effective as in the Representatives' judgment is advisable. The Company is further advised by the Representatives that the Securities are to be offered to the public initially at 99.959% of the principal amount of the Securities (the "Public
Terms of Public Offering
 
Offering Price"), plus accrued interest, if any, from July 2, 2009 to the date of payment and delivery, and to certain dealers selected by the Representatives, at a price that represents a concession not in excess of 0.350% of the principal amount under the Public Offering Price, and that any Underwriter may allow, and such dealers may re-allow, a concession, not in excess of 0.125% of the principal amount of the Securities, to any Underwriter or to certain other dealers.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
     (b) . The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives and substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. To the extent the distribution of Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representatives with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act.
Filing of Amendments and Exchange Act Documents; Preparation of Final Term Sheet
     (c) . The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representatives, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.

Delivery of Registration Statement
 
     (d) . The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act.

If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement, to file a new registration statement, or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, (ii) use its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities), and (iii) furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
     (f) . The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not

     (g) . The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.

Restriction on Sale of Securities
     (j) . The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.

The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
          SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (b) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (e) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

Final Term Sheet dated June 29, 2009

Exhibit 4.1
     A. Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted on March 18, 2009 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Charlie Pleas, III, Senior Vice President and Controller, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
          (a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "5.750% Senior Notes due 2015" (the "Notes").
          (b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.959% of the principal amount thereof.
          (c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
          (d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on January 15, 2015, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
          (e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.750% per annum (unless such rate is adjusted pursuant to clause (o) hereof) from July 2, 2009, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on January 15, 2010, until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. January 1 and July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
          (f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
          (g) The Notes will be redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of
 
redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and a primary treasury dealer selected by Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and their respective successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the date of redemption to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, such notice of redemption need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
          (h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
          (i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in
 
definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The initial Depository for such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company.
          (j) The Notes shall be denominated in Dollars and the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes shall be in Dollars.
          (k) The Notes shall be defeasible as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.
          (l) The Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory sinking fund.
          (m) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in Section 4.2 of the Indenture and clause (A)(g) of this Officers' Certificate, Holders of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth in the Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to the Holders of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the Notes and described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflicts.
     "Capital Stock" means the capital stock of every class whether now or hereafter authorized, regardless of whether such capital stock shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage with respect to the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends and in the distribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of such corporation.

than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any Person, or any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other Person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control under clause (2) above if (i) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii)(A) the direct or indirect Holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the Holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
     "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
     "Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (A) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (B) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of a proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).

     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by at least two of the three Rating Agencies on any day during the period (which period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing 60 days prior to the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.

          (n) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall be required, to the extent lawful:
          (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
          (ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
          (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
     The paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Note, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          (o) If the rating of the Notes from any one or more of the three Rating Agencies is decreased to a rating set forth in any of the immediately following tables, the interest rate on the Notes will increase from the interest rate otherwise payable on the Notes by an amount equal to the sum of the percentages set forth in the following tables opposite those ratings; provided, that only the two lowest ratings assigned to the Notes (or deemed assigned, as provided in the rules of interpretation set forth below) will be taken into account for purposes of any interest rate adjustment:
 
     If at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and any of the Rating Agencies subsequently increases its rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes will again be adjusted (and decreased, if appropriate) such that the interest rate on the Notes equals the interest rate otherwise payable on the Notes prior to any adjustment plus (if applicable) an amount equal to the sum of the percentages set forth opposite the ratings in the tables above with respect to the two lowest ratings assigned to the Notes (or deemed assigned) at that time, all calculated in accordance with the rules of interpretation set forth below.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first Business Day after the rating change has occurred requiring an adjustment in the interest rate. If any Rating Agency changes its rating of the Notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last such change to occur will control in the event of a conflict. An "interest period" is the period from and including an Interest Payment Date (or the original issuance date of the Notes, if earlier) to but excluding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
     For purposes of making adjustments to the interest rate payable on the Notes, the following rules of interpretation will apply:
          (i) if a Rating Agency has ceased to provide a rating of the Notes for any reason, that Rating Agency will be deemed to have rated the Notes at the lowest level contemplated by the table above;
          (ii) if only one of the three Rating Agencies ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of that Rating Agency will be disregarded for purposes of all interest rate adjustments;
          (iii) if two of the three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the Notes for any reason, the deemed rating of only one of such two Rating Agencies will be disregarded;
          (iv) if all three Rating Agencies cease to provide a rating of the Notes for any reason, the interest rate on the Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the Notes prior to any adjustment;
 
          (v) each interest rate adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating by any one Rating Agency will be made independently of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments; and
          (vi) in no event will (A) the per annum interest rate on the Notes be reduced to below the interest rate otherwise payable on the Notes prior to any adjustment or (B) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate otherwise payable on the Notes prior to any adjustment.
     Promptly after any change in the interest rate on the Notes as provided above, the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing that (i) the effective date the interest rate on the Notes has changed in accordance with this Section A.(o); (ii) the amount of the related increase or decrease; and (iii) the new interest rate on the Notes.
     The interest rate on the Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's, "A" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P and "A" (or its equivalent) by Fitch, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
     "Rating Agency" means each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P.
          (p) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person more than 180 days following the Company's or its Subsidiary's acquisition of such Property, with the intention of taking back a lease of such Property (a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the terms of such sale or transfer have been determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and arm's length and either:
          (i) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value of such Property at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
          (ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
     The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.
     "Attributable Debt" in respect of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction means, at the time of determination, the present value discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the terms of the lease (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the obligations of the lessee under such lease for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease (including any period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the Company's option, be extended).
 
     "Funded Debt" means debt which matures more than one year from the date of creation, or which is extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor so that it may become payable more than one year from such date or which is classified, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet for the most recently ended fiscal quarter (or if incurred subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, would have been so classified) of the person for which the determination is being made. Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.
     "Senior Funded Debt" means all Funded Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries (except Funded Debt, the payment of which is subordinated to the payment of the Notes).
          (q) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on June 29, 2009, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
          (r) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xviii) other Liens on Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing debt having an aggregate principal amount (or deemed amount, in the case of Attributable Debt) not to exceed, as of any date of incurrence of such secured debt pursuant to this clause and after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the greater of (1) $500 million and (2) 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
          (s) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
          (t) The Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.
          (u) The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
          (v) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
          (w) The Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
          (x) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.
 
     B. The undersigned hereby approve the sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes by the Company to the Underwriters listed in Schedule I to that certain Underwriting Agreement dated June 29, 2009, and in accordance with and pursuant to the terms thereof at a net purchase price to the Company of 99.359% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from July 2, 2009, and with an initial price to the public of 99.959% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from July 2, 2009.
     The Indenture, as supplemented by this Officers' Certificate, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Officers' Certificate shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.
     This Officers' Certificate may be executed in one or more counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and shall together constitute one and the same Officers' Certificate.
     THIS OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto executed this Officers' Certificate as of the 2 day of July, 2009.

Original Issue Date: July 2, 2009 Interest Payment Dates: January 15 and July 15 Maturity Date: January 15, 2015 Interest Rate: 5.750%
     AUTOZONE, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million dollars (the "Principal Amount") on the Maturity Date shown above, except as provided below, and to pay interest thereon at the rate per annum shown above. (Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on January 15, 2010. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be
 
the January 1 or the July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
     If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated July 2, 2009 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "5.750% Senior Notes due 2015" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
     The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
     In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Interest Rate set forth above may be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the rating of the Notes and the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
 
     The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and a primary treasury dealer selected by Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and their respective successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, such notice of redemption need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give
 
the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of
provided
however
 
this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
     THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
     All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     Unless the certificate of authentication has been executed by manual signature of the Trustee, this Note shall not be valid.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed manually or in facsimile.

Item 1.01. Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.
     The information set forth under Item 2.03 below is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
     AutoZone has other commercial relationships with certain parties to the Revolving Credit Agreement described in Item 2.03 below. From time to time, several of the lenders or their affiliates furnish general financing and banking services to AutoZone.
Item 1.02. Termination Of A Material Definitive Agreement.
     The information set forth under Item 2.03 below is incorporated into this Item 1.02 by reference.
     AutoZone has other commercial relationships with certain parties to the Revolving Credit Agreement described in Item 2.03 below. From time to time, several of the lenders or their affiliates furnish general financing and banking services to AutoZone.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On July 9, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") took the following action:
     The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the Four-Year Credit Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Prior Credit Facilities." The Prior Credit Facilities provided for aggregate credit of up to $1 billion, subject to increase at the election of AutoZone to an amount not to exceed $1.3 billion subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The principal amount of the
 
Five-Year Credit Facility was $700 million and the principal amount of the Four-Year Credit Facility was $300 million. The Prior Credit Facilities provided for up to $50 million in swingline loans and up to $200 million for letters of credit. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Facilities bore interest at fluctuating rates which, at AutoZone's election, were tied to Bank of America's prime lending rate or a Eurodollar rate. The Prior Credit Facilities were subject to customary covenants and conditions, including affirmative, negative and financial covenants. There was no prepayment or other penalty payable upon termination of the Prior Credit Facilities.
     The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans in the principal amount of up to $800 million, which amount may be increased to $1 billion at the election of AutoZone upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement terminates by its terms, and all amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement shall be due and payable, on July 15, 2012, but AutoZone may, on or after July 9, 2011, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request an extension of the termination date to July 15, 2013, in which event the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement may, at their individual options, elect to extend the termination date. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a $50 million sublimit for Swingline Loans and a $200 million aggregate sublimit for letters of credit.
     Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be base rate loans, Eurodollar loans, or a combination of both, at AutoZone's election. Base rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (A) the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus / of 1%, the Bank of America prime rate as publicly announced from time to time (the "Base Rate"), and the Eurodollar Rate plus 1%, plus (B) the Applicable Margin as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Eurodollar loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement plus the Applicable Margin. Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans shall equal the composite credit default swap spread for the three (3) year point on AutoZone's "trading convention credit default swap curve," calculated on a 30-day moving average basis, as obtained from time to time by the Administrative Agent from Markit Group Limited or its successor. The Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans shall equal the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans less 1% per annum (but not less than zero). The Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans (including the Applicable Margin as used to determine the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans prior to subtracting the 1% per annum) shall be subject to a floor and a ceiling based on AutoZone's senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt rating as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and/or Fitch, Inc.

     Certain revolving credit loans ("Swingline Loans") will be made available by Bank of America as Swingline Lender on a same-day basis in minimum amounts of $5 million, up to the $50 million Swingline Loan sublimit. Bank of America has the discretion to make or not make Swingline Loans. Any Swingline Loan must be repaid by AutoZone in full upon the earliest of (a) the maturity date of the Swingline Loan as agreed upon by the Swingline Lender and AutoZone (which shall be no more than seven (7) business days following the date of the Swingline advance), (b) the Termination Date of the Revolving Credit Facility (including any extension), and (c) the demand of the Swingline Lender. Swingline Loans that are base rate loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Swingline Loans that are
 
Quoted Rate Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the fixed percentage rate per annum offered by the Swingline Lender and accepted by AutoZone with respect to a particular Swingline Loan.
     A portion of the available credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement, but not to exceed $200 million, will be available for the issuance of letters of credit. Letters of credit will be issued by SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, or another lender acceptable to AutoZone and the Administrative Agent.
     AutoZone may prepay loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, provided that if prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan or a Quoted Rate Swingline Loan does not occur on the last day of an interest period or if AutoZone does not provide proper notice of intent to prepay (three (3) business days notice in the case of Eurodollar Loans and one (1) business day notice in the case of Base Rate Loans), then AutoZone will indemnify the lenders against lost spread due to improper notice or failure to pay on the last business day of an interest period. If a change of control occurs, each lender has the right to require AutoZone to prepay such lender's outstanding portion of loans and cash collateralize such lender's letter of credit obligations, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment. Each lender must determine whether to require such prepayment during the 20-day period following notice from the Administrative Agent.
     The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for transactions of this type. The financial covenants include covenants that AutoZone will not permit the ratio of its "Consolidated Adjusted Debt" to "Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR" to be greater than 3.10 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and will maintain a minimum ratio of "Consolidated EBITDAR" to "Consolidated Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rents" of 2.50 to 1.00. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable.

Item 1.02. Termination Of A Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 27, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") prepaid the outstanding obligations under its Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 among AutoZone, the several lenders from time to time parties thereto, Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent and Wachovia Bank, National Association as Syndication Agent, as amended by that First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of May 5, 2006, and as further amended by that Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 3, 2007 (collectively, the "Term Loan Agreement").
The Term Loan Agreement, in the principal amount of $300 million, was scheduled to expire in December 2009. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bore interest at fluctuating rates which, at AutoZone's election, were tied to Bank of America's prime lending rate or a Eurodollar rate. The Term Loan Agreement was subject to customary covenants and conditions, including affirmative, negative and financial covenants. No prepayment or early termination penalties were incurred.
Also on August 27, 2009, AutoZone terminated the interest rate swap agreement it entered on December 29, 2004, to effectively fix the interest rate of the borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement.
AutoZone has other commercial relationships with certain parties to the Term Loan Agreement. From time to time, several of the lenders or their affiliates furnish general financing and banking services to AutoZone.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 23, 2009 the Registrant issued a press release, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Exhibit 99.1.       Press release dated September 23, 2009
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 23, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.2 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 29, 2009, an increase of 1.0% from fiscal fourth quarter 2008 (17 weeks). Excluding sales from the additional week included in the prior year's quarter, sales were up 7.1%, and domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 5.4% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter decreased 3.1% from the same period last year to $236.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 14.2% to $4.43 per share from $3.88 per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the additional week in last year's fourth quarter results, comparable net income for the quarter increased 3.6% over the previous year's quarter, while diluted earnings per share increased 22.0%.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 50.3% last year). While gross margin was positively impacted through continued leverage of distribution costs due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs, it was offset by a shift in merchandise sales mix to lower margin products. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.6% (versus 31.4% last year). Excluding the impact from last year's additional week, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat with last year. Leverage from increased sales was largely offset by our continued investments in our enhanced hub stores and an acceleration of our store maintenance program. Additionally, included in operating expenses this quarter was a $3.6 million interest rate swap termination amount (16 bps) related to the prepayment of AutoZone's $300 million bank loan due in December 2009.
For the fiscal year ended August 29, 2009, sales were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 4.4%. Operating profit increased 4.6% on an operating margin of 17.3%. For fiscal 2009, net income increased 2.4% to $657 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 16.8% to $11.73 from $10.04. Excluding results from last year's additional week, sales increased 6.6% from the prior year, and operating profit increased 7.2%. Excluding last year's extra week, net income increased 5.0% and diluted earnings per share increased 19.7%.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $587 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $154 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 9.3 million shares of its common stock for $1.3 billion, at an average price of $140 per share.
The Company's inventory increased 2.7% over the same period last year. However, inventory per store was $500 thousand versus $507 thousand last year, a decrease of 1.4%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $20 thousand from $25 thousand last year. The Company believes the continued refinement of its hub and satellite store network heading into the new fiscal year will continue to help mitigate inventory growth while adding more late model parts coverage.
"We are very pleased with our comparable performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009. Our plan has remained generally consistent, and we have focused our efforts on enhancing the customer experience. In fiscal 2009, we again expanded our parts assortment, significantly increased the number of markets supported by our enhanced Hub store model, expanded our Commercial sales force, increased formalized training, and leveraged new technologies all primarily focused on customer service improvements. As our sales performance improved, we elected to accelerate the expansion of several of these initiatives to better position us to continue to grow our sales for the future. In fiscal 2009, we experienced market share gains in each of our four businesses. I'd like to thank all our AutoZoners across North America for their dedication and passionate commitment to our customers and our organization. Finally, I'd like to highlight that our return on invested capital increased again ending the year at 24.4 %. This performance highlights our commitment to a disciplined approach of increasing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 58 new stores, closed one store, and replaced three stores in the U.S. and opened 20 stores in Mexico. As of August 29, 2009, the Company had 4,229 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 188 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GA AP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Olsen, Executive Vice President, dated November 9, 2000 as amended December 29, 2008 (the "Employment Agreement"), amending the Employment Agreement as described herein.
Pursuant to the Amendment, Mr. Olsen will serve as AutoZone's Corporate Development Officer at a base salary of $365,000, subject to increase by AutoZone's Compensation Committee, devoting an average of 32 hours per week to AutoZone business.

Additionally, one of the benefits that Mr. Olsen would receive under such circumstances is a lump-sum amount equal to the total aggregate annual COBRA premium costs for group medical, dental and vision benefit coverage for Mr. Olsen and his spouse and dependents, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to such Separation from Service. Prior to the Amendment, the lump sum payment was to be two times such amount. The Amendment also provides that Mr. Olsen's agreement not to compete against AutoZone will extend for one year.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 8, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 21, 2009, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)   Exhibits
       99.1 Press Release dated December 8, 2009.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1   Press Release dated December 8, 2009

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 8, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.6 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 21, 2009, an increase of 7.5% from the first quarter of fiscal 2009 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 5.6% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $11.9 million, or 9.1%, over the same period last year to $143.3 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 26.4% to $2.82 per share from $2.23 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 50.1% last year). Gross margin increased by 20 basis points primarily due to leverage of distribution costs from lower fuel charges and improved efficiencies. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.9% (versus 34.0% last year). Operating expense leverage from increased sales volumes was offset by ongoing investments in our hub stores and an increase in pension expense due to the recognition of actuarial losses primarily from lower than expected investment performance in fiscal 2009.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock for $204 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $144 per share. The Company has $105 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 3.5% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $508 thousand versus $512 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $17 thousand from $43 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report a 26.4% increase in diluted earnings per share, which is our 13th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth. I would like to thank all AutoZoners across North America for their dedication and commitment to providing the type of customer service and trustworthy advice our customers have come to expect from AutoZone. This past quarter, both our Retail and Commercial businesses reported strong sales growth. We remain committed to our plan of continually improving our parts coverage, hiring, retaining and training the best automotive parts professionals, and growing our Commercial business. Additionally, we reported a 24.9% trailing four quarter return on invested capital ratio this past quarter, as we remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 21, 2009, AutoZone opened 38 new stores, closed two stores, and relocated one store in the U.S. and opened 5 stores in Mexico. As of November 21, 2009, the Company had 4,265 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 193 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, and public sector accounts. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a conference call this morning, Tuesday, December 8, 2009, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss its first quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com, by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-1211 through Tuesday, December 15, 2009 at 11:59 p.m. (EST).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comp arable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2009, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
     At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") on December 16, 2009, the stockholders of the Company approved the AutoZone, Inc. 2010 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan ("Plan"), intended to qualify as a performance-based compensation plan under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's key employees, as designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), who are or may become "covered employees" under Section 162(m) are eligible to participate in the Plan, and this includes the Company's named executive officers. Pursuant to the Plan, the Committee establishes objective performance goals at the beginning of each performance period (which has historically been the Company's fiscal year). After the end of each performance period, the Committee must certify the attainment of goals, if any, and direct the amount of incentive to be paid to each participant in cash. The Committee , in its discretion, may reduce or eliminate any bonus to be paid to a participant, even if a goal was attained. No participant may receive more than $4 million in any fiscal year as a bonus under the Plan.
     The above summary of the Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is attached as Exhibit A to the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2009 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On December 16, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the Company's common stock in connection with its ongoing share repurchase program. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 2, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 13, 2010, an increase of 4.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2009 (12 weeks).  Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 1.0% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $7.5 million, or 6.4%, over the same period last year to $123.3 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 21.2% to $2.46 per share from $2.03 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.0% (versus 49.7% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin of 36 basis points was positively impacted by a favorable shrink expense comparison of 17 basis points, a shift in mix of sales to higher margin product, and lower product acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.7% (versus 34.9% last year). The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was a result of tighter expense management, partially offset by 25 basis points of expense from the continued investment in our hub store initiative. Additionally, operating expenses for the quarter were negatively impacted by higher pension expense (20 basis points), partially offset by a favorable credit card class action settlement (17 basis points). 
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 565 thousand shares of its common stock for $88 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $155 per share. The Company has $517 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 3.3% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $504 thousand versus $509 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $26 thousand from $50 thousand last year. 
"We are pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth.  I would like to thank all AutoZoners for their commitment to delivering superior customer service, which we believe remains a competitive advantage. We continued our focus on improving parts coverage, hiring, retaining and training the best automotive parts professionals, and growing our Commercial business.  Additionally, we reported a 25.2% trailing four-quarter return on invested capital ratio this past quarter, as we remained committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 13, 2010, AutoZone opened 24 new stores in the U.S. and 9 new stores in Mexico. As of February 13, 2010, the Company had 4,289 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 202 stores in Mexico.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 25, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.8 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 8, 2010, an increase of 9.9% from the third quarter of fiscal 2009 (12 weeks).

For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.7% (versus 50.2% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin benefited from higher merchandise margins and leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales.  The merchandise margin improvement of 23 basis points was attributable to both a shift in mix to higher margin product and lower product acquisition costs.  Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.1% (versus 31.8% last year).  The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by 17 basis points of expense from the continued investment in our hub store initiative and 16 basis points from higher pension expense.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock for $266 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $172 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $251 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 2.1% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $506 thousand versus $516 thousand last year.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.4 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 28, 2010, an increase of 9.5% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 (16 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 6.7% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $32.8 million, or 13.9%, over the same period last year to $268.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 27.7% to $5.66 per share from $4.43 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.5% (versus 50.3% for last year's quarter).  The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and operating efficiencies (26 basis points).  Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.2% (versus 31.6% last year).  The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by increased legal costs (18 basis points), higher pension expense (16 basis points), and our continued investment in our hub store initiative (14 basis points).
For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010, sales were $7.4 billion, an increase of 8.0% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 5.4%. Operating profit increased 12.2% on an operating margin of 17.9%. For fiscal 2010, net income increased 12.4% to $738 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 27.6% to $14.97 from $11.73.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.8 million shares of its common stock for $565 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $199 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its common stock for $1.1 billion, at an average price of $176 per share. At the fiscal year end, the Company had $185 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 4.4% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $498 thousand versus $500 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, improved on a per store basis to a negative $28 thousand from a positive $20 thousand last year. The Company achieved a quarter ending accounts payable to inventory ratio of 106%, up from 96% last year.
"Our performance during the fourth quarter represents a strong conclusion to a very good year for AutoZone.  For the year, we set several new all-time records for our company: EBIT margin 17.9%, accounts payable to inventory ratio of 106%, operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion, and ROIC of 27.6%.  While the macro environment for our industry was certainly favorable, our team's commitment to our culture, constant refinements to our offerings, and high level of execution led to our second consecutive year of strong financial performance.  I would like to thank and congratulate our 60,000+ AutoZoners across North America for their impressive performance," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Jim Shea, Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Marketing, and Supply Chain will be retiring at the end of October 2010. "I would like to thank Jim for his many contributions to our organization over the last six years. While we will certainly miss Jim and his contributions, he has developed strong leaders who are well prepared to lead this organization to continued success well into the future," said Rhodes.

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On November 15, 2010, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.000% Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.000% per year, payable semi-annually.
     The Notes were sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") dated November 8, 2010 among the Company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2008, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152592), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated November 8, 2010, filed with the Commission on November 9, 2010. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company entered into an Officers' Certificate (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
     The Company will pay interest on the Notes on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning May 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2020. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
     The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Officer's Certificate. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate.
     The above description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, each of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, respectively.
 
ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
     The information set forth under Item 1.01 above with respect to the Notes is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
     (b) . The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

Termination of Underwriting Agreement
 
          SECTION 6. .
Indemnification
     (a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
 
contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
          SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company shall be deemed to be made as of the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Time only.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
          SECTION 9. .
Termination
     (a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum
Underwriting Agreement
 
or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
     (b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
          SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 36-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
          SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (b) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (e) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

Exhibit 4.1
EXECUTION VERSION
     A.Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted on March 16, 2010 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Brian L. Campbell, Vice President and Treasurer, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
          (a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "4.000% Senior Notes due 2020" (the "Notes").
          (b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.560% of the principal amount thereof.
          (c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
          (d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on November 15, 2020, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
          (e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 4.000% per annum from November 15, 2010, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on May 15, 2011, until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. May 1 and November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
          (f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
          (g) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of
 
redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
          (h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
          (i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The initial Depository for such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company.
          (j) The Notes shall be denominated in Dollars and the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes shall be in Dollars.
          (k) The Notes shall be defeasible as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.
          (l) The Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory sinking fund.
          (m) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in Section 4.2 of the Indenture and clause (A)(g) of this Officers' Certificate, Holders of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth in the Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").

The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflicts.

In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          (o) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person more than 180 days following the Company's or its Subsidiary's acquisition of such Property, with the intention of taking back a lease of such Property (a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the terms of such sale or transfer have been determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and arm's length and either:

prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
               (ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
     The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.

     "Funded Debt" means debt which matures more than one year from the date of creation, or which is extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor so that it may become payable more than one year from such date or which is classified, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet for the most recently ended fiscal quarter (or if incurred subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, would have been so classified) of the person for which the determination is being made. Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.

          (p) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on November 8, 2010, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
          (q) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xviii) other Liens on Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing debt having an aggregate principal amount (or deemed amount, in the case of Attributable Debt) not to exceed, as of any date of incurrence of such secured debt pursuant to this clause and after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the greater of (1) $500 million and (2) 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
          (r) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
          (s) The Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.
          (t) The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
          (u) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
          (v) The Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
          (w) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.
     B. The undersigned hereby approve the sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes by the Company to the Underwriters listed in Schedule I to that certain Underwriting Agreement dated November 8, 2010, and in accordance with and pursuant to the terms thereof at a net purchase price to the Company of 98.910% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from November 15, 2010, and with an initial price to the public of 99.560% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from November 15, 2010.
     The Indenture, as supplemented by this Officers' Certificate, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Officers' Certificate shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.
     This Officers' Certificate may be executed in one or more counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and shall together constitute one and the same Officers' Certificate.
     THIS OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto executed this Officers' Certificate as of the 15 day of November, 2010.

Original Issue Date: November 15, 2010 Interest Payment Dates: May 15 and November 15 Maturity Date: November 15, 2020 Interest Rate: 4.000%
     AUTOZONE, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) (the "Principal Amount") on the Maturity Date shown above, except as provided below, and to pay interest thereon at the rate per annum shown above. (Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on May 15, 2011. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above.
 
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or the November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
     If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated November 15, 2010 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "4.000% Senior Notes due 2020" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
     The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
 
     In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
     The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
 
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot
provided
however
 
be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer,
 
employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
     THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.

such interest, which shall be the May 1 or the November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated November 15, 2010 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "4.000% Senior Notes due 2020" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
     The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
     In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
 
     The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City
 
the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
provided
however
 
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company.

ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 7, 2010, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 20, 2010, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)     Exhibits
99.1     Press Release dated December 7, 2010.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1     Press Release dated December 7, 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 7, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.8 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 20, 2010, an increase of 12.7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 9.5% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $28.8 million, or 20.1%, over the same period last year to $172.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 33.7% to $3.77 per share from $2.82 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.7% (versus 50.3% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased penetration of Duralast product offerings and lower product acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 33.9% last year).  The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs (35 basis points), higher legal expenses (27 bps), and continued investments in our hub store initiative (18 basis points).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $300 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $231 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $386 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 4.4% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $508 thousand consistent with last year.  
"We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance.  This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth in earnings per share and our seventeenth consecutive quarter of double digit growth.  While the macro environment for our industry remains favorable, our results are a direct result of the strong commitment to excellence of our 60,000+ AutoZoners across North America.  Their commitment to our culture and to our customers is our key point of differentiation.  Additionally, our return on invested capital on a trailing four-quarter basis reached another new all-time high at 28.6%.  We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital appropriately," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
During the quarter ended November 20, 2010, AutoZone opened 15 new stores and replaced four stores in the U.S. and opened 3 new stores in Mexico. As of November 20, 2010, the Company had 4,404 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 241 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, and public sector accounts. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information, and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com, and as part of our commercial sales program, through www.autozonepro.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
AutoZone will host a conference call this morning, Tuesday, December 7, 2010, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss its first quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-1211 through Tuesday, December 14, 2010 at 11:59 p.m. (EST).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regula tions. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 28, 2010, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business.

Item 5.02.
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
.
. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") on December 15, 2010, AutoZone's stockholders approved the AutoZone, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan ("Plan"). The Plan previously had been approved by AutoZone's Board of Directors (the "Board") on October 17, 2010, subject to stockholder approval, and became effective immediately upon such stockholder approval. The Plan will allow AutoZone to provide equity-based compensation to non-employee directors and employees for their service to AutoZone or its subsidiaries or affiliates.
AutoZone, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan
The Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") or the Board, where applicable, to grant stock options (including incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, deferred stock, stock payments, performance share awards and other incentive awards. The Plan also authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant awards payable in the form of common stock that are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") Section 162(m).
The aggregate number of shares of common stock available for equity grants pursuant to the Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 2,886,756, which is equal to the aggregate number of shares available for issuance on December 15, 2010 under the AutoZone, Inc. 2006 Stock Option Plan, the AutoZone, Inc. First Amended and Restated 2003 Director Compensation Plan and the AutoZone, Inc. First Amended and Restated 2003 Director Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Prior Plans") and (ii) any shares subject to awards outstanding under the Prior Plans as of December 15, 2010 which, on or after December 15, 2010, are forfeited or otherwise terminate or expire for any reason without the issuance of such shares. The number of shares authorized for grant as incentive stock options is 2,886,756. As of December 15, 2010, no further awards will be granted for issuance pursuant to the Prior Plans, as well as pursuant to the AutoZone, Inc. Third Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan, the AutoZone, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 1998 Director Compensation Plan and the AutoZone, Inc. Fourth Amended and Restated 1998 Director Stock Option Plan; however any outstanding awards under any of those plans will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any one participant pursuant to the Plan during any calendar year is 200,000.
 
The aggregate number of shares of AutoZone common stock available for equity grants pursuant to the Plan will be reduced by two shares for every share delivered in settlement of an award other than (i) a stock option, (ii) a stock appreciation right or (iii) any other award for which the holder pays the intrinsic value existing as of the date of grant (such awards, "Full Value Awards"), and each other award will be treated as using one share for each share subject to such award. To the extent that any award other than a Full Value Award is forfeited, expires or is settled in cash without the delivery of shares to the holder, then any shares subject to the award will again be available for the grant of an award pursuant to the Plan; if such forfeited, expired or cash-settled award is a Full Value Award, then the number of shares available under the Plan will be increased by two shares for each share subject to the award that is forfeited, expired or cash-settled.
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, or such other committee of members of the Board as the Board may designate from time to time, except the Board shall conduct the general administration of the Plan with respect to awards granted to non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee may, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members or to one or more officers of AutoZone. However, the Compensation Committee may not make any delegation of its authority with regard to the granting of awards to (i) individuals subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) certain employees with respect to awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code or (iii) officers or directors of AutoZone to whom authority to grant or amend awards has been delegated pursuant to the Plan.
The Plan also contains provisions with respect to payment of purchase prices, vesting and expiration of awards, treatment of awards upon a change of control of AutoZone, adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and mergers, transferability of awards and tax withholding requirements. The Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board at any time. Outstanding grants may be amended by the Compensation Committee or the Board (subject to the provisions of the Plan); provided, that such amendment does not impair the rights of the participant holding such grant without his or her consent, except to the extent the amendment is made to cause the Plan or grant to comply with applicable laws. If it is not terminated sooner, the Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date on which the Plan was adopted by the Board, except with respect to then-outstanding grants.
The above summary of the Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is attached as Exhibit A to AutoZone's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference.
. On December 15, 2010, the Compensation Committee of AutoZone's Board of Directors approved a Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement ("Agreement") between AutoZone and William C. Rhodes, III, AutoZone's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, awarding Mr. Rhodes a grant of restricted stock units (the "Restricted Stock Units") with respect to 25,000 shares of AutoZone's common stock pursuant to the Plan.

(ii) In the event that neither the Share Value Performance Condition nor the EPS Performance Condition is met on or before October 1, 2015, eighty percent (80%) of the Restricted Stock Units shall be earned if the Share Value Performance Condition is satisfied during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) October 1, 2016 or the EPS Performance Condition is satisfied during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) August 27, 2016.
Any Restricted Stock Units that become earned shall vest immediately upon the earliest to occur of the following dates on or after the date on which they have been earned: (i) October 1, 2015, (ii) October 1, 2016 or (iii) the date of Mr. Rhodes' termination of employment with AutoZone by reason of a termination by AutoZone without Cause or due to the Mr. Rhodes' death or Disability (each, as defined in the Agreement).
The vested Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares of AutoZone common stock. Unless Mr. Rhodes elects to defer the payment of the shares of AutoZone common stock with respect to the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, all of the Restricted Stock Units that become vested will be paid in shares of AutoZone common stock as soon as practicable at the earliest to occur of the following dates on or after the date on which they become vested: (i) October 1, 2015, (ii) October 1, 2016 or (iii) the date of Mr. Rhodes' qualifying termination of employment by the Company without Cause or due to his death or Disability.
Any Restricted Stock Units which have not been earned as of the date on which Mr. Rhodes' employment with AutoZone terminates for any reason shall not become vested.
The above summary of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K.

Section 1.2  Consideration to Company
In consideration for the grant of Restricted Stock Units provided for in this Agreement, the Executive agrees to render faithful and efficient services to the Company or to any Subsidiary.

(i) One hundred percent (100%) of the Restricted Stock Units shall be earned either (A) on the date on which the Company's Common Stock achieves a Fair Market Value equal to or greater than $461.12 per share for five (5) consecutive trading days (the "Share Value Performance Condition") at any time during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) October 1, 2015 or (B) the Company achieves a Diluted Earnings Per Share equal to or greater than $29.94 (the "EPS Performance Condition") on the last day of any fiscal year during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) August 29, 2015; or
(ii) In the event that neither the Share Value Performance Condition nor the EPS Performance Condition is met on or before October 1, 2015, eighty percent (80%) of the Restricted Stock Units shall be earned if the Share Value Performance Condition is satisfied during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) October 1, 2016 or the EPS Performance Condition is satisfied during the period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on (and including) August 27, 2016.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Cause" shall mean the Executive's willful engagement in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; provided, however, no act or failure to act will be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company and (ii) "Disability" shall mean a determination by the Company that the Executive is "totally disabled," as that term is defined in the Company's long term disability plan as in effect from time.
2.3  Payment of Vested Restricted Stock Units
(a) Unless the Executive has elected to defer the payment of shares of Common Stock with respect to the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), all of the Executive's Restricted Stock Units which are then vested pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 hereof shall be paid in shares of Common Stock as soon as practicable after the earliest to occur of the following dates on or after the date on which they are vested: (i) October 1, 2015, (ii) October 1, 2016 or (iii) the date of the Executive's termination of employment by the Company without Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, provided that such termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) (a "Separation from Service").
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Restricted Stock Unit shall be paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof during the six (6)-month period following the Executive's Separation from Service if the Company determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any of the Executive's Restricted Stock Units is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such six (6)-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of the Executive's death), such Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in shares of Common Stock.
(c) All payments made in shares of Common Stock shall be made by the Company in the form of whole shares of Common Stock, and any fractional share shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to the value of such fractional share determined based on the Fair Market Value as of the date immediately prior to such payment.

2.4  Restricted Stock Units Not Transferable
During the lifetime of the Executive, the Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares of Common Stock have lapsed. The Restricted Stock Units and any interest or right therein shall not be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Executive or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence.
2.5  Tax Withholding
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to require payment by the Executive of any sums required by applicable law to be withheld with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock Units or the issuance of shares of Common Stock, as applicable. Such payment shall be made by deduction from other compensation payable to the Executive or, in the sole discretion of the Executive, may include:
(i) Cash or check;
(ii) Surrender of shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under the Restricted Stock Units) held for such period of time as may be required by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences and having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld by statute; or
(iii) Through the delivery of a notice that the Executive has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to shares of Common Stock then issuable under the Restricted Stock Units, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of its withholding obligations; provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale).
The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any new certificate representing shares of Common Stock to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative or enter such share of Common Stock in book entry form unless and until the Executive or the Executive's legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state and local taxes applicable to the taxable income of the Executive resulting from the grant of the Restricted Stock Units or the issuance of shares of Common Stock.
 
2.6  Adjustments Upon Specified Events
Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Common Stock contemplated by Section 13.2 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such Common Stock), the Administrator shall make such adjustments the Administrator deems appropriate in the number of Restricted Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Restricted Stock Units. The Executive acknowledges that the Restricted Stock Units are subject to amendment, modification and termination in certain events as provided in this Agreement and Section 13.2 of the Plan.
3.1  Administration
The Administrator shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret, amend or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith shall be final and binding upon the Executive, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee or the Board shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan, this Agreement or the Restricted Stock Units.
3.2  Binding Agreement
Subject to the limitation on the transferability of the Restricted Stock Units contained herein, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

Shares of Common Stock which are paid in settlement of Restricted Stock Units may be either previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares of shares purchased on the open market. The shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be held in book entry form and no certificates shall be issued therefor; , , that certificates may be issued for shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement at the request of the holder and in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Company, as amended or supplemented from time to time.

provided
however
(a) The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed;
(b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or of any other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable;

In the event that the Company delays a payment in settlement of Restricted Stock Units because it reasonably determines that the issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of Restricted Stock Units will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law, such payment shall be made at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably determines that the making of such payment will not cause such violation, as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(ii). The Company shall not delay any payment if such delay will result in a violation of Section 409A of the Code.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On March 1, 2011, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 12, 2011, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d)     Exhibits
99.1     Release dated March 1, 2011.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1     Press Release dated March 1, 2011

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 1, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.7 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 12, 2011, an increase of 10.3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 7.1% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $24.7 million, or 20.0%, over the same period last year to $148.1 million, while diluted earnings increased 35.8% to $3.34 per share from $2.46 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.9% (versus 50.0% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher margins on merchandise gross (45 bps) and lower shrink expense (39 bps). The increased merchandise gross margins continued to benefit this quarter from increased penetration of Duralast product sales and lower acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.6% (versus 34.7% last year).  The decrease in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily the result of leverage on store operating expenses due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs (39 bps), increased investments in our hub store initiative (23 bps), higher advertising expenditures (22 bps), and an unfavorable comparison to last year's second quarter credit card class action settlement (17 bps). 
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock for $394 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $257 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $491 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 7.0% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. 
"We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth in earnings per share and our eighteenth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. We remain committed to executing our 2011 operating theme of "1TEAM ." We continued our focus on improving parts coverage, hiring, retaining, and training the best automotive parts professionals, and growing our Commercial business. Additionally, our return on invested capital on a trailing four-quarter basis reached another new all-time high at 29.3%. We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Going the Extra Mile
During the quarter ended February 12, 2011, AutoZone opened 21 new stores in the U.S. and opened 8 new stores in Mexico. As of February 12, 2011, the Company had 4,425 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 249 stores in Mexico.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additio nal information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regula tions. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 28, 2010, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 24, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.0 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 7, 2011, an increase of 8.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 5.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $24.6 million, or 12.1%, over the same period last year to $227.4 million, while diluted earnings increased 28.5% to $5.29 per share from $4.12 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.2% (versus 50.7% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower shrink expense (35 bps) and higher merchandise margins (23 bps). The increased merchandise margins continued to benefit this quarter from increased penetration of Duralast product sales. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.4% (versus 31.1% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily the result of increased investments in our hub store initiative (18 bps) and higher fuel costs related to delivering products to Commercial customers (8 bps).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $339 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $267 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $152 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 8.9% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. Inventory per store was $527 thousand versus $506 thousand last year, an increase of 4.1%.
"We are very pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth in earnings per share and our nineteenth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Our results are the direct reflection of the dedication and commitment of our 60,000+ AutoZoners, who strive everyday to meet or exceed the needs of our customers. Additionally, our consistent, disciplined approach to enhancing our offerings through our ongoing initiatives is resonating with our customers, resulting in continued growth in market share. This quarter we achieved two significant milestones. We exceeded $1 billion in sales in our Commercial business on a trailing four quarter basis and we set another new all-time record for return on invested capital at 30.2%. We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 7, 2011, AutoZone opened 43 new stores, closed one store, replaced one store in the U.S. and opened 12 new stores in Mexico. As of May 7, 2011, the Company had 4,467 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 261 stores in Mexico.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On September 13, 2011, AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of September 13, 2011 (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") among AutoZone as Borrower, the several Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent and Swingline Lender ("Bank of America"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent ("JPMorgan"), arranged by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as Joint Lead Arrangers and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., U.S. Bank National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital as Joint Book Runners. The Revolving Credit Agreement amends AutoZone's Credit Agreement dated as of July 9, 2009 among AutoZone, the several lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America as Syndication Agent and Swingline Lender and JPMorgan as Syndication Agent, by, among other things, increasing the committed credit amount from $800 million to $1 billion, reducing facility fees and applicable margins on Base Rate and Eurodollar loans, and extending the maturity date to September 13, 2016.
The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans in the principal amount of up to $1 billion, which amount may be increased to $1.25 billion at the election of AutoZone upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement terminates by its terms, and all amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement shall be due and payable, on September 13, 2016, but AutoZone may, on or after September 13, 2013, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request an extension of the termination date to September 13, 2017, in which event the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement may, at their individual options, elect to extend the termination date. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a $75 million sublimit for Swingline Loans and a $200 million aggregate sublimit for letters of credit.
Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be base rate loans, Eurodollar loans, or a combination of both, at AutoZone's election. Base rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (A) the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus / of 1%, the Bank of America prime rate as publicly announced from time to time, and the Eurodollar Rate plus 1% (the "Base Rate"), plus (B) the Applicable Margin as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Eurodollar loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement plus the Applicable Margin. Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans shall be between zero and 47.5 basis points based on AutoZone's senior unsecured (non-credit enhanced) long term debt rating as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and/or Fitch, Inc. (the "AutoZone Unsecured Debt Rating"). Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans shall be between 77.5 basis points and 147.5 basis points based on the AutoZone Unsecured Debt Rating. In addition, Facility Fees under the Revolving Credit Agreement were reduced and now vary from 10 to 27.5 basis points based on the AutoZone Unsecured Debt Rating.

Certain revolving credit loans ("Swingline Loans") will be made available by Bank of America as Swingline Lender on a same-day basis in minimum amounts of $5 million, up to the $75 million Swingline Loan sublimit. Bank of America has the discretion to make or not make Swingline Loans. Any Swingline Loan must be repaid by AutoZone in full upon the earliest of (a) the maturity date of the Swingline Loan as agreed upon by the Swingline Lender and AutoZone (which shall be no more than seven (7) business days following the date of the Swingline advance), (b) the Termination Date of the Revolving Credit Facility (including any extension), and (c) the demand of the Swingline Lender. Swingline Loans that are base rate loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Swingline Loans that are Quoted Rate Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the fixed percentage rate per annum offered by the Swingline Lender and accepted by AutoZone with respect to a particular Swingline Loan.
A portion of the available credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement, but not to exceed $200 million, will be available for the issuance of letters of credit. Letters of credit will be issued by SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, or another lender acceptable to AutoZone and the Administrative Agent.
AutoZone may prepay loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, provided that if prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan or a Quoted Rate Swingline Loan does not occur on the last day of an interest period or if AutoZone does not provide proper notice of intent to prepay (three (3) business days notice in the case of Eurodollar Loans and one (1) business day notice in the case of Base Rate Loans), then AutoZone will indemnify the lenders against lost spread due to improper notice or failure to pay on the last business day of an interest period. If a change of control occurs, each lender has the right to require AutoZone to prepay such lender's outstanding portion of loans and cash collateralize such lender's letter of credit obligations, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment. Each lender must determine whether to require such prepayment during the 20-day period following notice from the Administrative Agent.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for transactions of this type. The financial covenants include covenants that AutoZone will not permit the ratio of its "Consolidated Adjusted Debt" to "Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR" to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and will maintain a minimum ratio of "Consolidated EBITDAR" to "Consolidated Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rents" of 2.50 to 1.00. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable.
As of the date of the Amendment and Restatement of the Revolving Credit Facility, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.6 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 27, 2011, an increase of 8.1% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 (16 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 4.5% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $32.5 million, or 12.1%, over the same period last year to $301.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 26.9% to $7.18 per share from $5.66 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.2% (versus 50.5% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower shrink expense (47 bps) and higher merchandise margins. Retail price increases on commodity based products drove the higher merchandise margins, which were partially offset by increased penetration of Commercial sales. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.4% (versus 31.2% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was the result of higher self insurance costs (38 bps) and higher fuel costs primarily related to commercial deliveries (16 bps), partially offset by leverage due to higher sales volumes.
For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2011, sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 9.6% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 6.3%. Operating profit increased 13.3% on an operating margin of 18.5%. For fiscal 2011, net income increased 15.0% to $849 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 30.0% to $19.47 from $14.97. Driven by improved earnings and declining working capital, return on invested capital reached 31.3%, while cash flow before share repurchases was $1.024 billion.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock for $433 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $289 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 5.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $262 per share. At the fiscal year end, the Company had $219 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 7.0% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per store was $512 thousand versus $498 thousand last year and $527 thousand last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, improved on a per store basis to a negative $60 thousand from a negative $28 thousand last year.
"Our fourth quarter performance was a strong conclusion to a record breaking year for AutoZone.  At the beginning of the year, we challenged the organization to build on the robust performance we had experienced over the last two years.  Our AutoZoners, through their passion, dedication and never ending commitment to meet or exceed our customers' expectations, delivered.  For fiscal 2011, we delivered 30% growth in earnings per share.  We also achieved several all-time company records; exceeded $8 billion in sales, surpassed $1 billion in commercial sales, grew fiscal year EBIT margin to 18.5% and exceeded 30% return on invested capital ending the year at 31.3%.  This financial success is a direct result of the tremendous contributions of our more than 60,000 dedicated AutoZoners, and I would like to congratulate them on this exceptional performance," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
During the quarter ended August 27, 2011, AutoZone opened 68 new stores, replaced five stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened 18 new stores in Mexico.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified; provided, however, that unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or law, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, either with or without cause, from the Board of Directors at any meeting of stockholders by the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of the Corporation's stock.
Section 2. Vacancies on the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or otherwise, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of directors and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the voting power of the Corporation's stock may summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
Section 3. The property and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-Laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

Section 7. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum, shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall constitute a quorum.
Section 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.
Section 9. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 10. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in
 
 
 
the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power in reference to amending the Articles of Incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors, fixthe designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the By-Laws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution, By-Laws, or the Articles of Incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt Articles of Merger.
 
Section 11. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.
Section 12. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 13. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys'
 
 
 
fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he either is not liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person is liable pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
(b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. Indemnification shall not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.
(c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he must be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.
(d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b), unless ordered by a court shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination shall be made (1) by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation's stock, (2) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding, (3) if a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the act, suit or proceeding so order, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) if a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
 
 
 
(e) Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 13. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to the other paragraphs of this Section 13, (i) does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to paragraph (b) or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to paragraph (e), may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action; and (ii) continues for a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section 13 is not paid in full within ninety (90) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
(g) The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of a majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors, the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 13.
(h) The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation to enter into a contract with any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than those provided for in this Section 13.
 
(i) For the purposes of this Section 13, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent Corporation
 
 
 
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section with respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence had continued.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 6, 2011, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 19, 2011, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d) Exhibits
99.1 Press Release dated December 6, 2011.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 6, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.9 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 19, 2011, an increase of 7.4% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 4.6% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $19.0 million, or 11.1%, over the same period last year to $191.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 24.0% to $4.68 per share from $3.77 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.1% (versus 50.7% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower distribution costs on higher sales (23 bps), lower shrink expense (18 bps) and slightly higher merchandise margins. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.4% (versus 33.6% last year). The improvement in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was due to lower incentive compensation (33 bps), favorable legal expense (32 bps) and leverage from higher sales volumes.  This leverage was partially offset by higher self insurance costs (51 bps).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 954 thousand shares of its common stock for $310 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $325 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $659 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 7.2% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and continued strategic investments in parts assortment. Inventory per store was $524 thousand versus $508 thousand last year, an increase of 3.0%.
"After three years of impressive financial performance, we are pleased to begin fiscal 2012 with strong quarterly results.  This past quarter marked our twelfth consecutive quarter of 20% growth in earnings per share and our twenty-first consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Our 4.6% same store sales and 22.6% growth in Commercial sales are both testaments to our organization's efforts to continually improve and further validation of our strategies. We continue to execute on our '1Team operating theme for 2012. Our financial success continues to be the direct result of the tremendous contributions of our more than 65,000 dedicated AutoZoners, and I am convinced it is their dedication to helping our customers that differentiates us from our competition and drives our successes. We remain focused on our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Driving our Future'

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 28, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.8 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 11, 2012, an increase of 8.6% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 (12 weeks).

For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.3% (versus 50.9% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense (35 bps). Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.7% (versus 34.6% last year). The primary contributor to the increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was higher self insurance costs (59 bps), partially offset by leverage of other operating expenses due to higher sales volumes.

The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 27, 2011, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results.

SECTION 1. .
Representations and Warranties
(a) . The Company represents and warrants to the Representatives and to each Underwriter, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Time (as defined below) (in each case, a "Representation Date"), as follows:
Representations and Warranties by the Company
(i) . The Company is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 405").
Status as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer
At the time of filing the Registration Statement, at the earliest time thereafter that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Rule 405.
(ii) . The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, that became effective under the 1933 Act upon filing with the Commission and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of
Compliance with Registration Requirements
 
the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form. In addition, the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "1939 Act").
At the respective times the Registration Statement and each amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission (the "Annual Report on Form 10-K")) became effective, at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations and at each Representation Date, the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act (the "1939 Act Regulations") and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. At the date of the Prospectus and at the Closing Time, neither the Prospectus nor any amendments and supplements thereto included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Each preliminary prospectus (including the prospectus or prospectuses filed as part of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act) and the Prospectus, complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of Securities will, at the time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
As of the Applicable Time (as defined below), neither (x) the Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus(es) (as defined below) issued at or prior to the Applicable Time and the Statutory Prospectus (as defined below), all considered together (collectively, the "General Disclosure Package"), nor (y) any individual Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus (as defined below), when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
As of the time of the filing of the Final Term Sheet (as defined in Section 3(b)), the General Disclosure Package, when considered together with the Final Term Sheet, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

"Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule III hereto.
"Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not an Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus.
"Statutory Prospectus" as of any time means the prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the base prospectus that is included in the Registration Statement immediately prior to that time, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any preliminary or other prospectus deemed to be a part thereof.
Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the public offer and sale of the Securities or until any earlier date that the issuer notified or notifies the Representatives as described in Section 3(e), did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any preliminary or other prospectus deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified.
The representations and warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
(iii) . The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Time and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Securities, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities other than a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Representatives and included in Schedule III hereto.

Issuer Free Writing Prospectus

The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective assets, properties or operations is the subject which are not described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
(b) . The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

If at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws

Termination of Underwriting Agreement
 
SECTION 6. .
Indemnification
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
(b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company shall be deemed to be made as of the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Time only.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
SECTION 9. .
Termination
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or
Underwriting Agreement
 
crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 36-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
(a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On April 24, 2012, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.700% Notes due 2022 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 3.700% per year, payable semi-annually.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 17, 2012, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-180768), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated April 17, 2012, filed with the Commission on April 18, 2012. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company entered into an Officers' Certificate dated April 24, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning October 15, 2012. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2022. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Officer's Certificate. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate.
The above description of the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, each of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
 
 
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
(d) Exhibits. The following exhibits are furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 4.1
A. Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted by unanimous written consent on April 4, 2012 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Brian L. Campbell, Vice President and Treasurer, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
(a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "3.700% Senior Notes due 2022" (the "Notes").
(b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.984% of the principal amount thereof.
(c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
(d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on April 15, 2022, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
(e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 3.700% per annum from April 24, 2012, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on October 15, 2012 until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. The April 1 and October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
(f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
(g) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before January 15, 2022, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any
 
portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
If the Notes are redeemed on or after January 15, 2022, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before January 15, 2022 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a Primary Treasury Dealer (defined herein) selected by U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and a Primary Treasury Dealer, selected by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and their successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
 
(h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
(i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.

(i) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value of such Property at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
(ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.

Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.

(p) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on April 17, 2012, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
(q) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xviii) other Liens on Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing debt having an aggregate principal amount (or deemed amount, in the case of Attributable Debt) not to exceed, as of any date of incurrence of such secured debt pursuant to this clause and after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the greater of (1) $500 million and (2) 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
(r) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
(s) The Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.

(u) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
(v) The Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.

AUTOZONE, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) (the "Principal Amount") on the Maturity Date shown above, except as provided below, and to pay interest thereon at the rate per annum shown above. (Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on October 15, 2012. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the April 1 or the October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated April 24, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "3.700% Senior Notes due 2022" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before January 15, 2022, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
If the Notes are redeemed on or after January 15, 2022, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before January 15, 2022 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a Primary Treasury Dealer (defined herein) selected by U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and their successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
provided
however
may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
All terms used but not defined in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated April 24, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "3.700% Senior Notes due 2022" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before January 15, 2022, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
If the Notes are redeemed on or after January 15, 2022, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before January 15, 2022 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a Primary Treasury Dealer (defined herein) selected by U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and their successors and any other primary U.S. government
securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 22, 2012, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended May 5, 2012, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d) Exhibits
99.1 Press Release dated May 22, 2012.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 22, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.1 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 5, 2012, an increase of 6.7% from the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 3.9% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $21.2 million, or 9.3%, over the same period last year to $248.6 million, while diluted earnings increased 18.6% to $6.28 per share from $5.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.6% (versus 51.2% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales (25 bps) and lower shrink expense. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat to last year at 31.4%. During the quarter, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation (31 bps), which was partially offset by higher self insurance costs (23 bps).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $400 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $380 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $836 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 5.5% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. However, inventory per store was $536 thousand versus $527 thousand last year, an increase of 1.6%.
"We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance.  This quarter marks our twenty third consecutive quarter of double digit growth in earnings per share.  We remain committed to executing our 2012 operating theme of "1TEAM; ." We continued our focus on improving parts coverage; hiring, retaining, and training the best automotive parts professionals; and growing our Commercial business. This quarter we opened 121 new Commercial programs. I would like to thank all AutoZoners for their commitment to delivering superior customer service, which we believe remains a competitive advantage.  Additionally, our return on invested capital on a trailing four-quarter basis reached another new all-time high at 32.7%.  We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Driving our Future
During the quarter ended May 5, 2012, AutoZone opened 33 new stores and relocated three stores in the U.S. and opened 10 new stores in Mexico. As of May 5, 2012, the Company had 4,613 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 297 stores in Mexico for a total store count of 4,910.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions.

99.1 Press Release dated September 19, 2012.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1 Press Release dated September 19, 2012

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 19, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.8 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 25, 2012, an increase of 4.6% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 (16 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 2.1% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $22.3 million, or 7.4%, over the same period last year to $323.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 17.8% to $8.46 per share from $7.18 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.8% (versus 51.2% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was attributable to an improvement in merchandise margins (55 bps) primarily from lower acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.6% (versus 31.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was negatively impacted by higher store payroll (45 bps) and higher self-insurance costs (39 bps), partially offset by lower incentive compensation.
For the fiscal year ended August 25, 2012, sales were $8.6 billion, an increase of 6.6% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 3.9%. Operating profit increased 9.0% on an operating margin of 18.9%. For fiscal 2012, net income increased 9.6% to $930 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 20.6% to $23.48 from $19.47. Driven by improved earnings and a declining equity base, return on invested capital reached 33.0%, while full year cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $950 million.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $480 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $374 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $1.4 billion, at an average price of $359 per share. At the fiscal year end, the Company had $356 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 6.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per store was $525 thousand versus $512 thousand last year and $536 thousand last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, was flat, relative to last year, on a per store basis, at negative $60 thousand per store.
"I would like to thank our entire organization for the solid performance delivered this past quarter. We are pleased to report our twenty-fourth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. For the year, we reached many new milestones which included opening our 5,000 store in Alaska. We also improved our return on invested capital, achieving 33.0% at year end. While our same store sales performance was below our expectations for the quarter, we are confident we are well positioned to again deliver strong results for our new fiscal year. We remain committed to delivering exceptional customer service while growing our Retail, Commercial, and international store business models. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
th
During the quarter ended August 25, 2012, AutoZone opened 72 new stores, relocated 2 stores in the U.S. and opened 24 new stores in Mexico. As of August 25, 2012, the Company had 4,685 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 321 stores in Mexico for a total count of 5,006.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

To the extent the distribution of Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representatives with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act.
Filing of Amendments and Exchange Act Documents; Preparation of Final Term Sheet
(c) . The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representatives, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters. The Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
Delivery of Registration Statement
(d) . The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
Delivery of Prospectuses
 
(e) . The Company will comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement, to file a new registration statement, or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, (ii) use its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities), and (iii) furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
(f) . The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of this Agreement.
Blue Sky Qualifications
 
(g) . The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.

(j) . The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
Reporting Requirements
(k) . The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action reasonably necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.

(m) . If at any time when Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action reasonably necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
Notice of Inability to Use Automatic Shelf Registration Statement Form
(n) . The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the 1933 Act Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the 1933 Act Regulations.

Termination of Underwriting Agreement
SECTION 6. .
Indemnification
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or
 
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
 
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the
Contribution
 
aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the
 
Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company shall be deemed to be made as of the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Time only.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery

The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
Underwriting Agreement
 
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On November 13, 2012, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% Notes due 2023 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 2.875% per year, payable semi-annually.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 17, 2012, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-180768), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated November 1, 2012, filed with the Commission on November 2, 2012. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company executed an Officers' Certificate dated November 13, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2013. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2023. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Officers' Certificate. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate.
The above description of the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
(d) Exhibits. The following exhibits are furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 4.1
A. Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted at a meeting held on September 27, 2012 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Brian L. Campbell, Vice President and Treasurer of the Company, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
(a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "2.875% Senior Notes due 2023" (the "Notes").
(b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.672% of the principal amount thereof.
(c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $300,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
(d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on January 15, 2023, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
(e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 2.875% per annum from November 13, 2012, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on July 15, 2013 until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. The January 1 and July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
(f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
(g) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before October 15, 2022, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
 
If the Notes are redeemed on or after October 15, 2022, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before October 15, 2022 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Barclays Capital, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors and a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
(h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
(i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The initial Depository for such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company.
(j) The Notes shall be denominated in Dollars and the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes shall be in Dollars.
(k) The Notes shall be defeasible as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.
(l) The Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory sinking fund.
(m) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in Section 4.2 of the Indenture and clause (A)(g) of this Officers' Certificate, Holders of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth in the Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to the Holders of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the applicable notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the Notes and described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflicts.
"Capital Stock" of a corporation means the capital stock of every class whether now or hereafter authorized, regardless of whether such capital stock shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage with respect to the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends and in the distribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of such corporation.

any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any Person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any Person, or any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other Person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control under clause (2) above if (i) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii)(A) the direct or indirect Holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the Holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (A) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (B) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of a proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Inc., and its successors.
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.

"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by at least two of the three Rating Agencies on any day during the period (which period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing 60 days prior to the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Corporation, Inc., and its successors.
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified Person that is a corporation as of any date, the Capital Stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the Board of Directors of such Person.

(i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
The paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Note, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
(o) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person more than 180 days following the Company's or its Subsidiary's acquisition of such Property, with the intention of taking back a lease of such Property (a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the terms of such sale or transfer have been determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and arm's length and either:
(i) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value of such Property at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or
 
(ii) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, at the effective date of the sale or transfer, to incur debt secured by a Lien on such Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
The foregoing restriction in the paragraph above shall not apply to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (i) for a term of not more than three years including renewals; or (ii) between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries, provided that the lessor is the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary.
"Attributable Debt" in respect of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction means, at the time of determination, the present value discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the terms of the lease (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the obligations of the lessee under such lease for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease (including any period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the Company's option, be extended).
"Funded Debt" means debt which matures more than one year from the date of creation, or which is extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor so that it may become payable more than one year from such date or which is classified, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet for the most recently ended fiscal quarter (or if incurred subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, would have been so classified) of the person for which the determination is being made. Funded Debt does not include (1) obligations created pursuant to leases, (2) any debt or portion thereof maturing by its terms within one year from the time of any computation of the amount of outstanding Funded Debt unless such debt shall be extendable or renewable at the sole option of the obligor in such manner that it may become payable more than one year from such time, or (3) any debt for which money in the amount necessary for the payment or redemption of such debt is deposited in trust either at or before the maturity date thereof.
"Senior Funded Debt" means all Funded Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries (except Funded Debt, the payment of which is subordinated to the payment of the Notes).
(p) Clause (xiii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in Section 1.1 of the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xiii) Liens existing on November 1, 2012, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
(q) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:
(xviii) other Liens on Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing debt having an aggregate principal amount (or deemed amount, in the case of Attributable Debt) not to exceed, as of any date of incurrence of such secured debt pursuant to this clause and after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the greater of (1) $500 million and (2) 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
(r) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."
(s) The Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of the covenants in Article V of the Indenture.
(t) The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
(u) There shall be no Events of Default other than those provided in Section 7.1 of the Indenture and the failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of clauses A.(m) or (n) hereof.
(v) The Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
(w) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.
B. The undersigned hereby approve the sale of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes by the Company to the Underwriters listed in Schedule I to that certain Underwriting Agreement dated November 1, 2012, and in accordance with and pursuant to the terms thereof at a net purchase price to the Company of 99.022% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from November 13, 2012, and with an initial price to the public of 99.672% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any from November 13, 2012.
The Indenture, as supplemented by this Officers' Certificate, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Officers' Certificate shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.
This Officers' Certificate may be executed in one or more counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and shall together constitute one and the same Officers' Certificate.
THIS OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto executed this Officers' Certificate as of the 13

(Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.)

Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the January 1 or the July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated November 13, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "2.875% Senior Notes due 2023" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before October 15, 2022, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
If the Notes are redeemed on or after October 15, 2022, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before October 15, 2022 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Barclays Capital, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors and a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
provided
however
may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 4, 2012, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended November 17, 2012, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02:
(d) Exhibits
99.1 Press Release dated December 4, 2012.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1 Press Release dated December 4, 2012

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 4, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.0 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 17, 2012, an increase of 3.5% from the first quarter of fiscal 2012 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 0.2% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $12.3 million, or 6.4%, over the same period last year to $203.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.7% to $5.41 per share from $4.68 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.8% (versus 51.1% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to an improvement in merchandise margins (53 bps) driven by lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 33.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was negatively impacted by higher store payroll (34 bps), partially offset by lower advertising expense.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 855 thousand shares of its common stock for $317 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $371 per share. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had $788 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. Driven by improved earnings and a declining equity base, return on capital reached 33.0% at quarter end.
The Company's inventory increased 6.8% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per store was $537 thousand versus $524 thousand last year and $525 thousand last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, was flat, relative to last year, on a per store basis, at negative $64 thousand per store.
Additionally, AutoZone announces this morning that it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the assets and select liabilities of AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialized automotive products. 
"I would like to thank our entire organization for the solid performance delivered this past quarter. We are pleased to report our twenty-fifth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. While this past quarter's sales results were lower than planned, they were not surprising to us. Regional sales discrepancies continued to challenge our results, however we began to see improvements in our more challenged regions late in the quarter. We believe the initiatives we have in place are correct for delivering solid financial results, as we remain excited about our opportunities for the remainder of fiscal 2013. Our financial success will continue to be driven by the tremendous contributions of our more than 70,000 dedicated AutoZoners, and it is their dedication that will continue to differentiate us from our competition. Also, we look forward to formally welcoming the AutoAnything team to AutoZone. The company's culture and leadership is an outstanding fit with our Company as we look forward to growing our e-Commerce initiatives for many years to come. I want to reiterate we remain committed to delivering exceptional, 'WOW!' customer service while growing through our Retail, Commercial, International, ALLDATA, and e-Commerce initiatives. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 17, 2012, AutoZone opened 19 new stores, and closed one store in the U.S., opened 4 new stores in Mexico, and opened our first store in Brazil. As of November 17, 2012, the Company had 4,703 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S., 325 stores in Mexico, and one store in Brazil for a total count of 5,029.
AutoZone is the leading retailer, and a leading distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products.  Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, and public sector accounts, including select stores in Mexico. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com and www.alldatadiy.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
.
AutoZone will host a conference call this morning, Tuesday, December 4, 2012, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss its first quarter results. Investors may listen to the conference call live and review supporting slides on the AutoZone corporate website, www.autozoneinc.com by clicking "Investor Relations," "Conference Calls." The call will also be available by dialing (210) 839-8923. A replay of the call and slides will be available on AutoZone's website. In addition, a replay of the call will be available by dialing (203) 369-1211 through Tuesday, December 11, 2012 at 11:59 p.m. (EST).
This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 25, 2012, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
. On December 11, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company" or "AutoZone") approved the Third Amendment to the AutoZone, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Third Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Amendment of Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
The Third Amendment permits future compensation deferral elections up to 25% of base salary for a year and up to 75% of the amount of a bonus payable with respect to the year. Subject to the overall 75% limit on bonus deferrals, bonus deferral elections may also provide for (i) deferral of a percentage of the amount of the bonus that exceeds a specified dollar amount, or (ii) deferral of a percentage of the amount of the bonus in excess of the participant's target bonus amount for the year. With respect to compensation deferrals for future years (i.e., beginning with plan year 2013 deferrals), an election for installment payments will be limited to a maximum of a five (5) year installment payment period.
The Third Amendment also added certain cashout rules, including a discretionary cashout (as determined by the Administrative Committee) of balances that do not exceed the annual pre-tax contribution limit applicable to 401(k) plans, which applies with respect to all Plan benefits that are subject to Code Section 409A; and mandatory cashouts that apply only with respect to account balances attributable to 2013 and later plan years' deferrals and contributions. Under these Plan terms, installment distributions would be accelerated and cashed out as follows: (i) accounts less than $25,000 payable at the end of a deferral period; (ii) accounts less than $50,000 payable upon retirement; and (iii) accounts less than $100,000 at a participant's death.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
 
: The stockholders elected eight directors, each of whom will hold office until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2013 and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

Section 4.1 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
4.1.
    Deferrals by Participants
A Participant may file an Executive Deferred Compensation Agreement pursuant to which such Participant elects to make Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals with respect to Compensation earned during a Plan Year.
(a) A Participant's Executive Deferred Compensation Agreement for a Plan Year must be submitted to the Company within the time period prescribed by the Administrative Committee, and in any event before the first day of such Plan Year. If a Participant initially becomes an eligible employee (determined in accordance with Code Section 409A) and does not make an initial Base Salary Deferral or Bonus Deferral election within such time period, the Participant may file an Executive Deferred Compensation Agreement making a prospective Base Salary Deferral election (but not a Bonus Deferral election) either before or within 30 days after the date on which his participation becomes effective. A Participant may modify his Executive Deferred Compensation Agreement for a Plan Year at any time prior to the applicable deadline specified in this subsection, subject to any restrictions or procedures determined by the Administrative Committee.
(b) For each Plan Year, a Participant may elect to defer up to twenty-five percent (25%) of his Base Salary as a Base Salary Deferral and up to seventy-five percent (75%) of his Bonus Compensation as a Bonus Deferral. Subject to such limitation, a Bonus Deferral election may provide for deferral of a portion of a Participant's Bonus Compensation for a Plan Year described as a percentage of such Bonus Compensation only to the extent that such Bonus Compensation exceeds either: (i) a specified dollar amount of the Participant's Bonus Compensation, or (ii) the target amount of his Bonus Compensation for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Participant election shall be further subject to any maximum or minimum percentage or dollar amount limitations and to any other rules prescribed by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion.
(c) Base Salary Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals will be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the day of the month in which such Compensation otherwise would have been paid to the Participant in cash, provided that the Participant is an Employee on the payment date.
Section 8.3(a) shall be deleted and replaced with the following:
(a) In the event of distribution after the expiration of the Deferral Period, (i) for amounts in an Account attributable to Base Salary Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals, and matching credits pursuant to Section 4.2, with respect to Plan Years commencing prior to January 1, 2013, distribution may be made in a lump sum or in installment payments for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, and (ii) for amounts in an Account attributable to Base Salary Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals, and matching credits pursuant to Section 4.2, with respect to Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2013, distribution may be made in a lump sum or in installment payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years;
A new Section 8.9 shall be added at the end of Article VIII, to read as follows:
 
(a) Except as provided in subsection (d) below, if at any time a Participant's Non-Grandfathered Benefit does not exceed the applicable dollar amount under Code Section 402(g)(1)(B), the Administrative Committee may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay the Participant's entire Non-Grandfathered Benefit in an immediate single-sum payment; provided that such lump sum payment must result in the termination and liquidation of the entirety of the Participant's interest under the Plan attributable to his Non-Grandfathered Benefit, as well as the Participant's interest in all plans, agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements with respect to which deferrals of compensation are treated as having been deferred under a single nonqualified deferred compensation plan under Treas. Reg. 1.409A1(c)(2) and the total amount so paid under the Plan and the Participant's entire interest in any and all such other plans is not greater than the applicable dollar amount under Code Section 402(g)(1)(B).
(b) Any exercise of the Administrative Committee's discretion pursuant to subsection (a) shall be evidenced in writing no later than the date of the distribution.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in a Participant's Executive Deferred Compensation Agreement to the contrary, with respect to amounts in a Participant's Account attributable to Base Salary Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals, and matching credits pursuant to Section 4.2, with respect to Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2013, (i) if such amount in the Participant's Account is less than $25,000 at the end of a Deferral Period, other than a Deferral Period which the Participant elected to end on his Retirement Date, when distribution in installments would otherwise commence, (ii) if such amount in the Participant's Account is less than $50,000 at the end of a Deferral Period which a Participant elected to end on his Retirement Date, when distribution in installments would otherwise commence, or (iii) if such amount in the Participant's Account is less than $100,000 at the time of the Participant's death, when distribution in installments would otherwise continue, such amounts instead shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment when such installments otherwise would have commenced or continued.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent provided by Code Section 409A, with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Executive on the date of his Termination of Employment, no payment under this Section made on account of such Participant's Termination of Employment shall be made within 6 months after the date of the Participant's Termination of Employment.
All capitalized terms used in this Third Amendment shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan unless otherwise indicated herein.

On February 26, 2013, AutoZone, Inc. issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 9, 2013, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
99.1 Press Release dated February 26, 2013

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 26, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.9 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 9, 2013, an increase of 2.8% from the second quarter of fiscal 2012 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 1.8% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $9.3 million, or 5.6%, over the same period last year to $176.2 million, while diluted earnings increased 15.1% to $4.78 per share from $4.15 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.9% (versus 51.3% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.7% (versus 34.7% last year). Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased slightly due to the lower sales growth rates, partially offset by lower incentive compensation (47 bps).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 513 thousand shares of its common stock for $185 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $361 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $603 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 7.0% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable per store was a negative $54 thousand versus negative $51 thousand last year.
"While we are pleased to report our twenty-sixth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth, we were not pleased with our same store sales results for the quarter.  Historically, we have seen our sales increase significantly during the final two weeks of our second quarter.  However, this year our total domestic auto parts same store sales for the last two weeks declined by eight percent.  Our belief is the approximate two week delay in processing of income tax returns this year was the key contributor to this decline in sales.  Our expectation is sales in the upcoming quarter should recover to more normalized sales volumes.  Excluding the last two weeks, our sales were generally consistent with last quarter," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "I would like to thank and congratulate our entire team of 70,000+ AutoZoners for their intense dedication and hard work which delivered strong earnings per share and return on invested capital performance in the second quarter.  As we enter our key spring and summer selling season, we are optimistic about our future.  We believe we have the right initiatives in place to meet and exceed our customer's expectations.  We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital."
During the quarter ended February 9, 2013, AutoZone opened 32 new stores in the U.S. and opened nine new stores in Mexico. As of February 9, 2013, the Company had 4,735 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S., 334 stores in Mexico, and one store in Brazil for a total store count of 5,070.
AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy" and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: credit market conditions; the impact of recessionary conditions; competition; product demand; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Certain of these risks are discussed in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1A under Part 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 25, 2012, and these Risk Factors should be read carefully. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the "Risk Factors" could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.

Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results.

(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or
 
Table of Contents
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
Table of Contents
it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. .
Contribution
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the
 
Table of Contents
aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the
 
Table of Contents
Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
SECTION 8. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company shall be deemed to be made as of the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Time only.
SECTION 9. .
Termination
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.

(a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On April 29, 2013, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes due 2023 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 3.125% per year, payable semi-annually.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 17, 2012, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-180768), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated April 18, 2013, filed with the Commission on April 19, 2013. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company executed an Officers' Certificate dated April 29, 2013 (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2014. The Notes will mature on July 15, 2023. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Officer's Certificate. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate.
The above description of the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.

(a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "3.125% Senior Notes due 2023" (the "Notes").
(b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.447% of the principal amount thereof.
(c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
(d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on July 15, 2023, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
(e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 3.125% per annum from April 29, 2013, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on January 15, 2014 until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. The January 1 and July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
(f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
(g) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before April 15, 2023, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any
 
portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before April 15, 2023 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.

(h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
(i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities.

(Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on January 15, 2014. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above.

Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated April 29, 2013 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "3.125% Senior Notes due 2023" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before April 15, 2023, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
If the Notes are redeemed on or after April 15, 2023, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before April 15, 2023 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital, Inc. and their respective successors and a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected.

(NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.2 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 4, 2013, an increase of 4.5% from the third quarter of fiscal 2012 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.1% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $17.0 million, or 6.8%, over the same period last year to $265.6 million, while diluted earnings increased 15.8% to $7.27 per share from $6.28 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.8% (versus 51.6% for last year's quarter). The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by lower acquisition costs, partially offset by the inclusion of AutoAnything (39 bps). Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.1% (versus 31.4% last year). The improvement in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to net gains on disposal of certain assets (18 bps) and lower incentive compensation.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 833 thousand shares of its common stock for $325 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $390 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $278 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 6.3% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable per store was a negative $63 thousand versus negative $48 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our twenty-seventh consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. Our organization executed our game plan and delivered another quarter of solid performance. While sales results for the quarter finished below our expectations, we were pleased to see noticeable improvements in our performance during the final four weeks of the quarter, specifically in our more recently challenged Northeastern and Midwestern markets," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "I would like to again thank and congratulate our entire team of 70,000+ AutoZoners for their efforts to deliver strong earnings per share and return on invested capital results in the third quarter.  We believe our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory assortment and accelerate its deployment will have meaningful impacts on results for upcoming quarters.  We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital."
