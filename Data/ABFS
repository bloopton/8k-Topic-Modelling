Each Revolving Borrowing shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing given, not later than (i) 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the third Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Advance or (ii) 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the Business Day of the proposed Borrowing, in the case of a Base Rate Advance, by the Borrower to the Agent, and on the day of its receipt of a timely Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall transmit a copy of such notice to each Bank by telecopier; provided, however, that the Agent and each of the Banks hereby waive the requirement in clause (i) of this Section 2.2(a) that the Borrower provide three Business Days advance written notice of the date of the initial Borrowing. Each Swingline Advance shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing given by the Borrower to each of the Agent and Wells Fargo not later than 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day of the proposed Borrowing. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be in writing or by telecopier specifying the requested (A) date of such Borrowing, (B) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (C) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (D) if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Interest Period for each such Advance. In the case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.6(b). Each Bank shall (1) in the case of all Revolving Borrowings other than Borrowings made on the same day as the day the Notice of Borrowing is received, before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the date of such Borrowing and (2) in the case of Revolving Borrowings made on the same day as the date of the Notice of Borrowing or Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time), make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.2, or such other location as the Agent -24-
may specify by notice to the Banks, in same day funds, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and, except in the case of Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower or, in the case of Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, to Wells Fargo, in each case at the Borrower's or Wells Fargo's (as applicable) account designated in its respective written notice to the Agent. (b) Conversions and Continuations. In order to elect to Convert or continue Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Borrowing under this Section, the Borrower shall deliver an irrevocable Notice of Conversion or Continuation to the Agent at the Agent's office no later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) (i) on the Business Day of the proposed conversion date in the case of a Conversion of such Advances to Base Rate Advances and (ii) at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed Conversion or continuation date in the case of a Conversion to, or a continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each such Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be in writing or by telecopier, specifying (A) the requested Conversion or continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (B) the Borrowing amount and Type of the Advances to be Converted or continued, (C) whether a Conversion or continuation is requested and, if a Conversion, into what Type of Advances, and (D) in the case of a Conversion to, or a Continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Advances, the requested Interest Period. Revolving Advances may only be Converted or continued as Revolving Advances. Swingline Advances may not be Converted or continued. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation under this Section 2.2(b), the Agent shall provide each Bank with a copy thereof and, in the case of a Conversion to or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Advances, notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.6(b). For purposes other than the conditions set forth in Section 3.2, the portion of Revolving Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Borrowing that are Converted to Revolving Advances of another Type shall constitute a new Revolving Borrowing. (c) Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) above: (i) each Borrowing (other than a Borrowing of Swingline Advances) shall be in an aggregate amount not less than (A) $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $500,000, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or (B) $500,000 or greater multiples of $100,000, in the case of Base Rate Advances, and shall consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by the Banks ratably according to their respective Commitments; (ii) at no time shall there be more than five Interest Periods applicable to outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances; (iii) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing to be made if (A) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or (B) a Default has occurred and is continuing; -25-
(iv) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing to be Converted or continued if (A) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (v) (A) if any Bank shall, at any time prior to the making of any requested Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Advance of such Bank, but otherwise shall be considered part of the same Borrowing and interest on such Base Rate Advance shall be due and payable at the same time that interest on the Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising the remainder of such Borrowing shall be due and payable; and (B) such Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this clause (v) and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank; (vi) if the Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any requested Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance; (vii) if the Majority Banks shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Borrowing, notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks of making or funding their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be, for such Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance; and (viii) if the Borrower shall fail to select the duration or continuation of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1 and Section 2.2(a) or 2.2(b) above, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks and such Advances will be made available to the Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as Base Rate Advances or, if an existing Advance, Converted into Base Rate Advances. -26-
(d) Notices Irrevocable. Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any loss or out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any condition precedent for Borrowing set forth in Article III not being satisfied or waived by the Agent and the Majority Banks for any reason, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund the Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (e) Agent Reliance. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank before the date of any Revolving Borrowing or Mandatory Revolving Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to immediately repay to the Agent on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable on such day to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate for such day. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount and interest as provided above, such corresponding amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement even though not made on the same day as the other Advances comprising such Borrowing. (f) Bank Obligations Several. The failure of any Bank to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing. No Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Advance to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing. (g) Notes. The indebtedness of the Borrower to each Bank resulting from Revolving Advances owing to such Bank shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note of the Borrower payable to the order of such Bank in substantially the form of Exhibit H, appropriately completed. The indebtedness of the Borrower to Wells Fargo resulting from Swingline Advances owing to Wells Fargo shall be evidenced by the Swingline Note of the Borrower payable to the order of Wells Fargo in substantially the form of Exhibit I, appropriately completed. -27-
Section 2.3 Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Banks, a facility fee on the average daily aggregate amount of the Commitments, irrespective of the Borrower's usage of such Commitments, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for the period from the Effective Date until the Maturity Date, which fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Banks, a fee in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin calculated on the average daily maximum amount available from time to time to be drawn under such outstanding Letters of Credit, which fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date. In addition to the fees referred to in the preceding sentence, the Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account amendment, transfer and negotiation fees, in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding and issued by such Issuing Bank, which fees shall be due and payable in such amounts, at such times and otherwise in accordance with such Issuing Bank's then current policy. (c) Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent and/or Wells Fargo, for its benefit, the fees set forth in the Agent's Fee Letter. Section 2.4 Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Voluntary Reduction. The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the Commitments; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $1,000,000. Subject to Section 2.17, any termination or reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be permanent, with no obligation of the Banks to reinstate such Commitments and the facility fees provided for in Section 2.3(a) shall thereafter be computed on the basis of the Commitments, as so reduced. (b) Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) a change in control is reported by the Borrower in response to either Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of voting Capital Stock of the Borrower (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such Capital Stock) representing the Control Percentage or more of the combined voting power of the Borrower's then outstanding Capital Stock, -28-
then, in such event the Majority Banks may, at their sole option upon written notice to the Borrower (a "Termination Notice"), declare the obligation of each Bank to make Advances and the obligation of each Issuing Bank to issue, increase or extend Letters of Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate and the Commitments shall reduce to zero. Section 2.5 Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Advances. The Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each Revolving Advance on the Maturity Date. (b) Swingline Advances. The Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Advance on the earlier of the Maturity Date or the date which is three Business Days after the date such Swingline Advance was made. Section 2.6 Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: (a) Base Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times, to the lesser of (i) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Maximum Rate, payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the date such Base Rate Advance is payable in full, provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (A) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount becomes due plus two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate. (b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance, to the lesser of (i) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Maximum Rate, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance is payable in full; provided, however, in the case of an Interest Period greater than three months, accrued interest shall also be payable on the date that is three months after the first day of such Interest Period; and provided, further, that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (A) the greater of (1) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus two percent (2%) and (2) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due plus two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate. (c) Swingline Advances. If such Advance is a Swingline Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times, to the lesser of (i) the rate agreed to pursuant to the the letter agreement between the Borrower and Wells Fargo dated May 15, 2002 and (ii) the Maximum -29-
Rate, payable in arrears on the earlier of the Maturity Date of this Agreement or the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and, if a Default has then occurred and is continuing, on the date such Swingline Advance is payable in full, provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (1) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount becomes due plus two percent (2%) and (2) the Maximum Rate. (d) Usury Recapture. In the event that, but for limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, the rate of interest otherwise chargeable under this Agreement at any time is greater than the Maximum Rate, then the unpaid principal amount of the Advances shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the Advances equals the amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued on the Advances if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had at all times been in effect. In the event, upon payment in full of the Advances, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement on the Advances is less than the total amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had, at all times, been in effect, then the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Agent for the account of the Banks an amount equal to the difference between (i) the lesser of (A) the amount of interest which would have been charged on the Advances if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect and (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the Advances if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had at all times been in effect and (ii) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement on the Advances. In the event the Banks ever receive, collect or apply as interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Advances, and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Borrower. (e) Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) at all times during which an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, interest shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding principal amount of each Advance, and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, interest shall accrue on any other amount of the Obligations which is not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), in each case payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate, which interest at such rate shall accrue from the initial date of the giving of notice by the Agent to the Borrower of the occurrence of such Event of Default (as to clause (i) preceding) or from the date such amount of the Obligations became due until the date such amount is paid in full (as to clause (ii) preceding). -30-
Section 2.7 Prepayments. (a) Right to Prepay. The Borrower shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Advance except as provided in this Section 2.7. (b) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may elect to prepay any of the Advances, after giving notice thereof to the Agent (i) by 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day of prepayment of any Swingline Advance, and (ii) by 11:00 a.m. (Dallas Texas time) at least three Business Days' prior to the day of prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advances and at least one Business Day prior to the day of prepayment of any Base Rate Advances. Such notice must state the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of such prepayment, whether such prepayment should be applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances or Swingline Advances, and if applicable, the relevant Interest Period for the Advances to be prepaid. If any such notice is given, the Borrower shall prepay Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount specified in such notice, and shall also pay accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date; provided, however, that each partial prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $500,000. (c) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) Change of Control. On the fifth Business Day following the Borrower's receipt of a Termination Notice pursuant to Section 2.4(b) hereof, the Borrower shall be required to prepay all outstanding Advances and all other unpaid Obligations in full and to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure. (ii) Borrowing Base Deficiency. On each Borrowing Base Determination Date, the Borrower shall be required to prepay the Advances in an aggregate amount equal to the positive remainder, if any, of (A) the aggregate amount of all outstanding Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure on such date minus (B) the Borrowing Base, as determined on such Borrowing Base Determination Date (or, upon payment in full of all outstanding Advances, to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the amount by which the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base). (iii) Reduction of Commitments. In the event the Commitments are reduced in accordance with Section 2.4(a), the Borrower shall prepay the Advances to the extent the aggregate amount of all outstanding Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments after giving effect to such reduction (or, upon payment in full of all outstanding Advances, to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the amount by which the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the Commitments as so reduced). -31-
(iv) Accrued Interest. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date. (v) Avoidance of Breakage Costs. In the event that the amount of any mandatory prepayment of Advances under this Section 2.7(c) exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Advances which consist of Base Rate Advances (the amount of such excess being the "Excess Amount"), the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of making such prepayment in full, to prepay such outstanding Advances which are Base Rate Advances and to deposit an amount equal to the Excess Amount with the Agent in the Cash Collateral Account maintained by and in the sole dominion and control of the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks. Any amount so deposited shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the Obligations and applied to the prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Advances at the end of the current Interest Period(s) applicable thereto. On any day on which amounts collected in the Cash Collateral Account remain on deposit in or to the credit of the Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to the payment made on such day pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), and the Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent a written request or a telephonic request (which shall be promptly confirmed in writing) prior to 10:00 am (Dallas, Texas time) that such remaining collected amounts be invested in cash equivalents specified in such request, the Agent shall invest such funds, to the extent the Agent is reasonably able to do so, in such cash equivalents as are acceptable to, and with no risk to, the Agent on an overnight basis or with maturities such that amounts will be available to pay the Obligations secured thereby as they become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise; provided, however, that any loss resulting from such investments shall be charged to and be immediately payable by the Borrower on demand by the Agent. (d) Ratable Payments. Each payment of any Advance pursuant to this Section 2.7 or any other provision of this Agreement shall be made in a manner such that all Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing are paid in whole or ratably in part. (e) Effect of Notice. All notices given pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Borrower. Section 2.8 Breakage Costs. If (a) any payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance as a result of any payment pursuant to Section 2.7 or the acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Article VII or otherwise, (b) any Conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance pursuant to Section 2.12 or otherwise, or (c) the Borrower fails to make a principal or interest payment with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance on the date such payment is due and payable, the Borrower shall, within 10 days of any written demand sent by any Bank to the Borrower through the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of breakage costs) required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses or out-of-pocket costs or expenses -32-
which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or nonpayment, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or maintain such Advance. Section 2.9 Increased Costs. (a) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If, after the date hereof, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to time, within 30 days of written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of increased costs) sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost; provided, however, that, before making any such demand, each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. In determining such increased costs, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(a) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(a), shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such increased cost, (B) detailing the calculation of such cost, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(a) for any increased costs. (b) Capital Adequacy. If any Bank or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) implemented or effective after the date of this Agreement affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or such Issuing Bank and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend or such Issuing Bank's commitment to issue Letters of Credit or any Bank's commitment to risk participate in Letters of Credit and other commitments of this type, then, upon 30 days prior written notice by such Bank or such Issuing Bank (with a copy of any such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of -33-
such Bank or to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by such Bank or such Issuing Bank, additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of increased costs) sufficient to compensate such Bank or such Issuing Bank, in light of such circumstances, (i) with respect to such Bank, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend under this Agreement or its commitment to risk participate in Letters of Credit and (ii) with respect to such Issuing Bank, to the extent that such Issuing Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit. In determining such additional amounts, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(b) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(b), shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such additional amounts, (B) detailing the calculation of such additional amounts, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such additional amounts to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) for any additional amounts. (c) Letters of Credit. If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, any Issuing Bank or any Bank or (ii) impose on such Issuing Bank or any Bank any other condition regarding the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letters of Credit or any Letter of Credit Obligations, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to such Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit, or increase the cost to such Bank of its risk participation in any Letter of Credit (which increase in cost shall be determined by such Issuing Bank's or such Bank's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such event), then, within 30 days of written demand by such Issuing Bank or such Bank (with a copy sent to the Agent), as the case may be, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by such Issuing Bank or such Bank, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Bank for such increased cost. Each Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the booking of its Letters of Credit or risk participations if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this Section 2.9(c) and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Issuing Bank or such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be. In determining such increased costs, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution -34-
methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(c) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(c), shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such increased cost, (B) detailing the calculation of such cost, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(c) for any increased costs. Section 2.10 Payments and Computations. (a) Payment Procedures. Except if otherwise set forth herein, the Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the location referred to in the Notes (or such other location as the Agent shall designate in writing to the Borrower) in same day funds without set-off, counterclaims or other deduction. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable solely to the Agent, the Issuing Banks or a specific Bank pursuant to Section 2.1(b), 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.6(c), 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 2.12 or 2.13(c) but after taking into account payments effected pursuant to Section 9.4) to the Banks in accordance with each Bank's Pro Rata Share for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank or any Issuing Bank to such Bank or such Issuing Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Computations. All computations of interest or fees based on the Base Rate, the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Non-Business Day Payments. Whenever any payment shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) Agent Reliance. Unless the Agent shall have received written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks that the Borrower will -35-
not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for such day. (e) Application of Payments. Unless otherwise specified in Section 2.7 hereof, whenever any payment received by the Agent under this Agreement is insufficient to pay in full all amounts then due and payable under this Agreement and the Notes, such payment shall be distributed and applied by the Agent and the Banks in the following order: first, to the payment of fees and expenses due and payable to the Agent or Wells Fargo under and in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document; second, to the payment of all expenses due and payable under Section 2.11(c), ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate amount of such payments owed to each such Bank; third, to the payment of fees due and payable to the Issuing Banks pursuant to Section 2.3(b); fourth, to the payment of all other fees due and payable under Section 2.3 ratably among the Banks in accordance with their applicable Commitments; and fifth, to the payment of the interest accrued on and the principal amount of all of the Advances, Reimbursement Obligations and other Obligations, regardless of whether any such amount is then due and payable, ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate accrued interest plus the aggregate principal amount owed to such Bank. Section 2.11 Taxes. (a) No Deduction for Certain Taxes. Any and all payments by the Borrower shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.10, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank, each Issuing Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision of such jurisdiction (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes") and, in the case of each Bank and each Issuing Bank, Taxes by the jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision of such jurisdiction. If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.11), such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; provided, however, that if the Borrower's obligation to deduct or withhold Taxes is caused solely by such Bank's, such Issuing Bank's or the Agent's failure to provide the forms described in Section 2.11(e) and such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent could have provided such forms, no such increase shall be required; (ii) the -36-
Borrower shall make such deductions; and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Notes, or the other Credit Documents (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) Indemnification. In addition, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank, each Issuing Bank and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.11) paid by such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Each payment required to be made by the Borrower in respect of this indemnification shall be made to the Agent for the benefit of any party claiming such indemnification within 30 days from the date the Borrower receives written demand detailing the calculation of such amounts therefor from the Agent on behalf of such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent. If any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Agent receives a refund in respect of any taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section 2.11(c), such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the Borrower such refund. (d) Evidence of Tax Payments. The Borrower will pay prior to delinquency all Taxes payable in respect of any payment. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.2, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment of such Taxes. (e) Foreign Bank Withholding Exemption. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or a state thereof (a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on the date of this Agreement or upon the effectiveness of any Assignment and Acceptance (i) two duly completed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c)of the Code, with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto, appropriately completed, and a form W-8BEN, or other equivalent successor form, as appropriate, certifying in each case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes and (ii) any other governmental forms which are necessary or required under an applicable tax treaty or otherwise by law to reduce or eliminate any withholding tax, which have been reasonably requested by the Borrower. Each Bank which delivers to the Borrower and the Agent a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or other equivalent successor form, as appropriate, further undertakes to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further copies of such form, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or -37-
becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower and the Agent certifying in the case of a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes. If an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any delivery required by the preceding sentence would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent any Bank from duly completing and delivering any such letter or form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of U.S. federal income tax, such Bank shall not be required to deliver such forms. The Borrower shall withhold tax at the rate and in the manner required by the laws of the U.S. with respect to payments made to a Bank failing to timely provide the requisite Internal Revenue Service forms. Section 2.12 Illegality. If any Bank shall notify the Agent and the Borrower that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank then outstanding hereunder, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall, if demanded by such Bank in its notice, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time), (a) if not prohibited by law or regulation to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the last day of the Interest Period for each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Bank or (b) if prohibited by law or regulation to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the second Business Day following its receipt of such notice from such Bank, Convert all Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank then outstanding to Base Rate Advances and pay accrued interest on the principal amount Converted to the date of such Conversion and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such Conversion being made on such date. Each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this Section 2.12 and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 2.13 Letters of Credit. (a) Issuance. From time to time from the date of this Agreement until three months before the Maturity Date, at the request of the Borrower, each Issuing Bank shall, on any Business Day and on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, issue, increase, decrease, amend or extend the expiration date of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower (for its own benefit or for the benefit of any of its Subsidiaries). No Letter of Credit will be issued, increased or extended (i) if such issuance, increase or extension would cause the Letter of Credit Exposure to exceed the lesser of (A) $100,000,000 or (B) an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the aggregate Commitments minus (2) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Advances and Swingline Advances at such time; (ii) unless such Letter of Credit has an -38-
Expiration Date not later than the earlier of (A) one year after the date of issuance thereof or (b) five days before the Maturity Date; (iii) unless such Letter of Credit is in form and substance acceptable to the respective Issuing Bank in its sole discretion; (iv) unless such Letter of Credit is a standby letter of credit not supporting the repayment of indebtedness for borrowed money of any Person, other than a Letter of Credit issued in substitution of any letter of credit outstanding on the Effective Date and listed on Schedule 1.1(b); (v) unless the Borrower has delivered to the respective Issuing Bank a completed and executed letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form, which shall contain terms no more restrictive than the terms of this Agreement; and (vi) unless such Letter of Credit is governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 ("UCP") or any successor to the UCP. If the terms of any letter of credit application referred to in the foregoing clause (v) conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. (b) Participations. With respect to each letter of credit described on Schedule 1.1(b), the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks agree that such letters of credit shall constitute Letters of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement and each Bank agrees that it has a participation in the related Letter of Credit Exposure equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share on the Effective Date. On the date of the issuance or increase of any Letter of Credit on or after the Effective Date, each Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold to each other Bank and each other Bank shall have been deemed to have purchased from such Issuing Bank a participation in the Letter of Credit Exposure related to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share at such date and such sale and purchase shall otherwise be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each such participant Bank by telex, telephone or telecopy of each Letter of Credit of such Issuing Bank issued, increased or decreased, and the actual dollar amount of such Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit. Each Bank's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section 2.13(b) and to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank for such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed in full by the Borrower shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any of the circumstances described in Section 2.13(d) below, (ii) the occurrence and continuance of a Default, (iii) an adverse change in the financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or (iv) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, except for any such circumstance, happening or event constituting or arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank. (c) Reimbursement. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay on demand to each Issuing Bank in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank an amount equal to any amount paid by such Issuing Bank under or in respect of such Letter of Credit. In the event any Issuing Bank makes a payment pursuant to a request for draw presented under a Letter of Credit and such payment is not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower upon demand, such Issuing Bank shall give notice of such payment to the Agent and the Banks, and each Bank shall promptly reimburse such Issuing Bank for such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such payment, and such reimbursement shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to -39-
constitute a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower from such Bank. If such reimbursement is not made by any Bank to any Issuing Bank on the same day on which such Issuing Bank shall have made payment on any such draw, such Bank shall pay interest thereon to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes, empowers and directs the Agent and the Banks to record and otherwise treat each payment under a Letter of Credit not immediately reimbursed by the Borrower as a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances to the Borrower. (d) Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, notwithstanding the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit Documents; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Letter of Credit Documents; (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower or any Bank or any other Person may have at any time against any beneficiary or transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the respective Issuing Bank or any other Person or entity, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or in any Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect to the extent the respective Issuing Bank would not be liable therefor pursuant to the following Section 2.13(e); (v) payment by the respective Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 2.13(d) shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any remedies of the Borrower in connection with the Letters of Credit. (e) Liability of Issuing Banks. The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of -40-
such Letter of Credit. No Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (i) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the relevant Letter of Credit; or (iv) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit (including such Issuing Bank's own negligence), except that the Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to, and shall promptly pay to, the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by (A) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (B) such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificate strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, any Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. Section 2.14 Determination of Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base shall be determined by the Agent, as follows: (a) Monthly. On the 25th day of each calendar month the Agent shall determine the Borrowing Base upon receipt of a Borrowing Base Certificate dated as of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month. (b) Property Adjustments. Following (i) any sale by the Borrower or any Guarantor of any Property included in the Borrowing Base with a sales value in excess of $25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end, (ii) any loss or casualty not covered by insurance resulting in destruction of any Property included in the Borrowing Base if the loss or casualty exceeds $25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end, or (iii) any permitted purchase by the Borrower or any Guarantor of any Property which can be included in the Borrowing Base with a purchase price in excess of $25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end (each of such events hereinafter called an "Adjustment Event"), the Borrower shall (in -41-
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above) or may (in the case of clause (iii) above) give the Agent notice of such Adjustment Event within five Business Days of the closing of such Adjustment Event, and the Agent may in its sole reasonable discretion (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above) or shall (in the case of clause (iii) above) further adjust the appropriate Borrowing Base components set forth in the most recent month end Borrowing Base Certificate delivered by the Borrower to the Banks to reflect the Adjustment Events occurring since the date of such Borrowing Base Certificate. (c) Notice of Borrowing Base Change. Promptly following any date the Borrowing Base is redetermined in accordance with this Section 2.14, the Agent shall give notice to the Banks and the Borrower of the new Borrowing Base. Section 2.15 Bank Replacement. (a) Right to Replace. The Borrower shall have the right to replace each Bank affected by a condition under clause (v) of Section 2.2(c), Section 2.9 or Section 2.12 for more than 90 days or each Bank which fails to consent to any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.18 (each such Bank, an "Affected Bank") in accordance with the procedures in this Section 2.15 and provided that no reduction of the total Commitments occurs as a result thereof. (b) First Right of Refusal; Replacement. (i) Upon the occurrence of any condition permitting the replacement of a Bank, each Bank which is not an Affected Bank shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to increase its respective Commitment by an amount not to exceed the amount of the Commitments of the Affected Banks, which election shall be made by written notice from each such Bank to the Agent and the Borrower given within 30 days after the date such condition occurs specifying the amount of such proposed increase in such Bank's Commitment. (ii) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election is in excess of the Commitments of the Affected Banks, (A) the Commitments of the Affected Banks shall be allocated pro rata among such Banks based on the respective amounts of the proposed increases to Commitments elected by each of such Banks, and (B) the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts as so allocated so that, after giving effect to such termination and increases, the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks will be the same as prior to such termination. (iii) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election equals the Commitments of the Affected Banks, the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts of their proposed increases so that, after giving effect to such termination and increases, the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks will be the same as prior to such termination. -42-
(iv) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election is less than the Commitments of the Affected Banks, (A) the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts of their proposed increases, and (B) the Borrower shall add additional Banks which are Eligible Assignees to this Agreement to replace such Affected Banks, which additional Banks would have aggregate Commitments no greater than those of the Affected Banks minus the amounts thereof assumed by the other Banks pursuant to such increases. (c) Procedure. Any assumptions of Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be made by the purchasing Bank or Eligible Assignee and the selling Bank entering into an Assignment and Assumption and by following the procedures in Section 9.6 for adding a Bank. In connection with the increase of the Commitments of any Bank pursuant to the foregoing Section 2.15(b), each Bank with an increased Commitment shall purchase from the Affected Banks at par such Bank's ratable share of the outstanding Advances of the Affected Banks and assume such Bank's ratable share of the Affected Banks' Letter of Credit Exposure. Section 2.16 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) on account of its Advances or its share of Letter of Credit Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments on account of the Advances or Letter of Credit Obligations obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall notify the Agent and forthwith purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Advances made by them or Letter of Credit Obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be rescinded and such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of the participation sold by such Bank to the purchasing Bank as a result of such excess payment to (b) the total amount of such excess payment) of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Bank's required repayment to the purchasing Bank to (ii) the total amount of all such required repayments to the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless and until rescinded as provided above, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 2.17 Increase of Commitments. By delivery of an effective Increase Notice to the Agent (which the Agent shall promptly distribute to the Banks), the Borrower may request an increase of the aggregate amount of the Commitments; provided that (a) the aggregate amount of the Commitments both before and after giving effect to such requested increase shall not exceed $275,000,000, (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom and (c) the Borrower shall cause to be delivered to the Agent a commitment (or -43-
commitments) from (i) at least one Bank that commits to lending to the Borrower more than its then current Commitment (such Bank to be referred to herein as an "Existing Bank" and such amount of its commitment above its then current Commitment to be referred to herein as a "Commitment Supplement") and/or (ii) any other Person (including an Affiliate of a Bank) that meets the requirements (other than the approval requirement) of clause (a) or (b) of the definition of "Eligible Assignee" (as defined in Article I hereof) and that commits to lending to the Borrower and becoming a Bank under this Agreement (such Person to be referred to herein as a "New Bank" and the amount of its commitment to be referred to herein as a "New Commitment") (each Existing Bank and each New Bank to be referred to herein collectively as the "Supplementing Banks"). Upon receipt of notice from the Agent to the Banks and the Borrower that the Supplementing Banks have agreed to commit to increase the Commitments by an aggregate amount equal to the Increase Amount (as defined below) and execution and delivery by the Borrower, the Agent and the Supplementing Banks of an Increased Commitment Agreement evidencing such agreement, then (A) the then current aggregate Commitments shall be increased by the Increase Amount, (B) the then current Commitment of each Existing Bank shall be increased by such Existing Bank's Commitment Supplement and (C) each of the New Banks will be added as a Bank under this Agreement and each such New Bank's Commitment shall be such New Bank's New Commitment. On the effective date of the Increased Commitment Agreement, the Borrower shall request a Revolving Advance hereunder, which Revolving Advance shall be made by (and only by) the Supplementing Banks in the appropriate amounts as provided below. The proceeds of such Revolving Advance shall be utilized by the Borrower to repay the Banks that did not agree to increase their Commitments, such Revolving Advance and repayment to be in amounts sufficient so that, after giving effect to the Increased Commitment Agreement, the Revolving Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure shall be held by the Banks according to their Pro Rata Share of the Commitments as increased in accordance with the Increased Commitment Agreement. Section 2.18 Extensions of the Maturity Date. In the manner set forth in this Section 2.18, the Borrower may request that the Maturity Date may be extended (i) up to two times, in each case, for a period of one year measured from the Maturity Date then in effect or (ii) once for a period no longer than two years measured from the Maturity Date in effect as of the Effective Date. If the Borrower wishes to request such an extension of the Maturity Date, it shall give written notice to that effect to the Agent not less than 60 days prior to the date that is one year prior to the Maturity Date then in effect. If the Agent approves of the requested extension of the Maturity Date, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of receipt of such request and of the new requested Maturity Date. Each Bank shall endeavor to respond to such request, whether affirmatively or negatively (such determination in the sole discretion of such Bank), by notice to the Borrower and the Agent within 21 days of receipt of such request. If (but only if) all Banks approve of the requested extension of the Maturity Date, the Maturity Date for all purposes of this Agreement shall be the extended Maturity Date specified in the notice from the Agent to the Banks that was approved by all Banks, and the Agent shall give written notice of such extended Maturity Date to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and the Banks. Section 2.19 Agreements regarding Subsidiaries. (a) Domestic Subsidiaries. The Borrower agrees that it shall cause each Domestic Subsidiary to guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations pursuant -44-
to the Guaranty to be executed by such Subsidiary prior to or substantially concurrent with the Borrower's execution of this Agreement. Contemporaneously with the creation or acquisition of any Domestic Subsidiary after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall (i) cause such Domestic Subsidiary to guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations by executing and delivering to the Agent an Accession Agreement, (ii) deliver a certificate covering the same matters described in clause (iii) of Section 3.1(a) with respect to such Domestic Subsidiary and (iii) deliver an opinion of Borrower's counsel with respect thereto covering the matters previously opined on with regard to each Guarantor. (b) Foreign Subsidiaries. The Borrower agrees that it shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary that owns any Capital Stock of a Foreign Subsidiary to, pledge two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of each class of Capital Stock of each Foreign Subsidiary (or, in the event that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries own, in the aggregate, less than two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of such Capital Stock, all of such issued and outstanding shares owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries) to the Agent as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, each of which pledges shall be pursuant to a pledge and security agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (the "Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements"); provided, however, that neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pledge the Capital Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, contribute less than 12.5% of the EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined as of the most recent Calculation Day based on the Calculation Period then ended; provided, further, however, that if, for any subsequent Calculation Period, EBITDA of the Foreign Stock Subsidiaries whose Capital Stock is not pledged pursuant to this Section 2.19(b) equals 12.5% or more of the EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall promptly (and in any event within ten Business Days after such determination is initially made) execute additional Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements which pledge the Capital Stock of additional Foreign Subsidiaries such that the EBITDA of the Foreign Stock Subsidiaries whose Capital Stock is not pledged is less than 12.5% of the EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Each of such pledges shall constitute a perfected, first priority Lien in all such Capital Stock of each Foreign Subsidiary. In addition to the foregoing and in connection with the Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements, the Borrower and its applicable Subsidiaries shall deliver to the Agent the original certificates evidencing all of the Capital Stock so pledged, together with stock powers appropriately executed in blank or other instruments of transfer in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent. ARTICLE III CONDITIONS OF LENDING Section 3.1 Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of this Agreement.

The Borrower will not permit its ratio, calculated as of each Calculation Day, commencing June 30, 2002 and continuing thereafter through and including the Maturity Date, for the Calculation Period then ended, of (a) Adjusted EBITDA for such Calculation Period to (b) the positive remainder of (i) Consolidated Interest Expense for such Calculation Period minus (ii) interest income for such Calculation Period, to be less than 4.5 to 1.0. Section 6.12 Net Worth. The Borrower will not permit its Consolidated Net Worth, as of each Calculation Day, commencing June 30, 2002 and continuing thereafter through and including the Maturity Date, to be less than an amount equal to the sum of (a) $272,000,000, plus (b) 50% of the Cumulative Net Income (as defined below), plus (c) 50% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of equity by the Borrower after the Closing Date. For purposes of determining the Borrower's compliance with this Section 6.12, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of cash then previously paid during the period from the Closing Date to the earlier to occur of such -62-
Calculation Day or the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date by the Borrower to its shareholders for repurchases or redemptions of its Capital Stock, which payments have reduced the Borrower's Consolidated Net Worth by the amount of such payments, permitted in accordance with Section 6.5 or (ii) $25,000,000, shall be added as an adjustment to the Borrower's Consolidated Net Worth. For purposes of this Section 6.12, the following terms shall have the following meanings: "Cumulative Net Income" means the cumulative Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the period from April 1, 2002 through the applicable Calculation Day (the "subject period"), exclusive of (i) any Net Losses (as defined below) during any completed fiscal quarter during such subject period and (ii) positive Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during any completed fiscal quarter during the Recovery Period not to exceed, in the aggregate, the aggregate amount of the Net Losses excluded pursuant to clause (i) preceding.

"Recovery Period" means, with respect to each fiscal quarter during the subject period in which there were Net Losses, the period of up to four consecutive fiscal quarters which occur during the subject period and which immediately succeed the fiscal quarter during which such Net Losses occurred. In the case that there have been two or more different fiscal quarters in which there have been Net Losses during the subject period (resulting in two or more different Recovery Periods) and positive Consolidated Net Income has occurred within each Recovery Period, the positive Consolidated Net Income shall be first applied to recovering the Net Losses that occurred first. Section 6.13 Maximum Leverage Ratio. The Borrower will not permit its Leverage Ratio, calculated as of each Calculation Day, commencing June 30, 2002 and continuing thereafter through and including the Maturity Date, for the Calculation Period then ended, to be greater than 2.75 to 1.00. Section 6.14 Capital Expenditures. The Borrower may make or permit any of its Subsidiaries to make or commit to make any Capital Expenditure; provided, however, if the Borrower's Senior Debt is not rated either BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody's (or, if either such rating agency shall cease to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower and the rating of the rating agency that continues to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower falls below the applicable rating specified in this sentence), then Capital Expenditures of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may not exceed $100,000,000, net of any Net Cash Proceeds received from the sale of any capital asset during such period if such sale is permitted pursuant to Section 6.4, in an aggregate amount during any fiscal year during which such circumstance has occurred.

may be incurred thereunder, if (A) the execution, delivery and performance of such Additional Permitted Indebtedness Document conflicts with, or constitutes a violation of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or (B) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries conflicts with, or constitutes a violation of, such Additional Permitted Indebtedness Document; (v) except for Capital Leases, the due date for the payment or prepayment of all principal of the Additional Permitted Indebtedness shall be at least 60 days after the Maturity Date (exclusive of the effect of any acceleration of the maturity thereof upon the occurrence of an event of default thereunder); (vi) all Additional Permitted Indebtedness must be pari passu or subordinate in right of payment to the Obligations; and (vii) the aggregate principal amount of Additional Permitted Indebtedness that constitutes purchase money Indebtedness or Capital Leases shall not exceed $30,000,000 at any time outstanding. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, if the Borrower's Senior Debt is not rated either BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody's (or, if either such rating agency shall cease to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower and the rating of the rating agency that continues to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower falls below the applicable rating specified in this sentence), then the Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any Additional Permitted Indebtedness without the prior written consent of the Majority Banks; and (e) extensions, renewals and refinancing of any of the Indebtedness specified in Sections 6.15(a), 6.15(b), 6.15(c) and/or 6.15(d) so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness is not thereby increased. Section 6.16 Acquisition Expenditures.

statements, including, but not limited to, the balance sheet and the related statements of income, of the Person to be acquired that have been prepared as of a date or for a period ended (as applicable) within the 12 month period prior to such Acquisition Expenditure or series of related Acquisition Expenditures or, to the extent that such audited financial statements are not otherwise available, the Borrower shall either cause such audited financial statements to be prepared or cause the EBITDA of the Person to be acquired to be calculated and confirmed by independent certified public accountants and deliver such calculation and confirmation to the Agent; and (c) at the time of such Acquisition Expenditure, the Borrower's Senior Debt is rated BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody's. Notwithstanding this clause (c) preceding, if the Borrower's Senior Debt is not rated either BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody's (or, if either such rating agency shall cease to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower and the rating of the rating agency that continues to rate the corporate debt obligations of the Borrower falls below the applicable rating specified in this sentence), then the Borrower may make an Acquisition Expenditure if (and only if) such Acquisition Expenditure is identified on Schedule 6.16 and is not in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate.

The Borrower hereby pledges, and grants to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks a Lien and security interest in, all funds held in the Cash Collateral Account from time to time and all proceeds thereof, as security for the payment of the Obligations, including without limitation all Letter of Credit Obligations owing to any Issuing Bank or any other Bank due and to become due from the Borrower to any Issuing Bank or any other Bank under this Agreement in connection with the Letters of Credit. (b) Application against Letter of Credit Obligations. The Agent may, at any time or from time to time, apply funds then held in the Cash Collateral Account to the payment of any Letter of Credit Obligations owing to any Issuing Bank, in such order as the Agent may elect, as shall have become or shall become due and payable by the Borrower to any Issuing Bank under this Agreement in connection with the Letters of Credit. (c) Duty of Care. The Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any such funds. Section 7.5 Non-exclusivity of Remedies. No remedy conferred upon the Agent or the Banks is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each remedy shall be cumulative of all other remedies existing by contract, at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Section 7.6 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the granting of the consent, if any, specified by Section 7.2 to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances or any other amount or Obligation payable hereunder or under the other Credit Documents due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2 or the automatic acceleration of the Advances or any such other amounts or Obligations pursuant to Section 7.3, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, the Note held by such Bank and the other Credit Documents, irrespective of whether or -69-
not such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement, such Note or such other Credit Documents, and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees to promptly notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Bank under this Section 7.6 are in addition to any other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have. ARTICLE VIII AGENCY AND ISSUING BANK PROVISIONS Section 8.1 Authorization and Action. Each Bank hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as administrative agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents on behalf of such Bank and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and of the other Credit Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Credit Document (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Banks, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Banks and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or applicable law. Section 8.2 Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken (including the Agent's own negligence) by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Bank and shall not be responsible to any Bank for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Credit Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document on the part of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries; (e) shall not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. -70-
Section 8.3 The Agent and Its Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent. The term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if the Agent were not an agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks. Section 8.4 Bank Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.5 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Section 8.5 Indemnification. The Banks severally agree to indemnify the Agent and each Issuing Bank (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), according to their respective Pro Rata Shares from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or such Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any other Credit Document (including the Agent's or such Issuing Bank's own negligence), provided that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's and such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. Section 8.6 Successor Agent and Issuing Banks. The Agent or any Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Banks upon receipt of written notice from the Majority Banks to such effect. Upon receipt of notice of any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent or Issuing Bank with, if an Event of Default has not occurred and is not continuing, the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent or Issuing Bank shall have been so appointed, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's or Issuing Bank's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, then the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank may, on behalf of the Banks and the Borrower, appoint a successor Agent or Issuing Bank, which shall be a commercial bank meeting the financial -71-
requirements of an Eligible Assignee and, in the case of an Issuing Bank, a Bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent or Issuing Bank by a successor Agent or Issuing Bank, such successor Agent or Issuing Bank shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, and the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, except that the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain an Issuing Bank with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and outstanding on the effective date of its resignation or removal and the provisions affecting such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit shall inure to the benefit of the retiring Issuing Bank until the termination of all such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Agent's or Issuing Bank's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent or Issuing Bank, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent or Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Section 8.7 Co-Syndication Agents. The Co-Syndication Agents shall not have any duties, obligations or liabilities in their capacities as Co-Syndication Agents. Section 8.8 Documentation Agent. The Documentation Agent shall not have any duties, obligations or liabilities in its capacities as Documentation Agent. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS Section 9.1 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document, nor consent to any departure by the Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Banks (or, if specifically provided for in any Credit Document, the Agent with the consent of the Majority Banks) and the Borrower, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment shall increase the Commitment of any Bank without the written consent of such Bank, and no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, do any of the following: (a) increase the aggregate Commitments of the Banks, except as permitted by Section 2.17, (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts or Obligations payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document, (c) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts or Obligations payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document, (d) amend Section 2.16 or this Section 9.1, (e) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, other than the release of any Guarantor's obligations under the Guaranty in accordance with Section 6.8, or (f) amend the definition of "Majority Banks"; and provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent or any Issuing Bank in addition to the Banks required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, and (ii) no waiver or consent to departure from any of the conditions specified in Section 3.1 or 3.2 shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Majority Banks and the Agent. -72-

Section 9.3 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Bank, the Agent or any Issuing Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.4 Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment and enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, (a) the fees set forth in the Agent's Fee Letter, and (b) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any, of the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Bank (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of the Agent, such Issuing Bank and each Bank) in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents after a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (c) to the extent not included in the foregoing, the costs of any Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or continuation statement, and any related Uniform Commercial Code search conducted subsequent to such recordation. Section 9.5 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent, and when the Agent shall have, as to each Bank, received a counterpart hereof executed by such Bank, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement or any interest in this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Bank. -73-

Any Bank may assign to one or more banks or other entities all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it, the Notes held by it and the participation interest in the Letter of Credit Obligations held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and shall involve a ratable assignment of such Bank's Commitment and such Bank's Revolving Advances, (ii) the amount of the resulting Commitment and Revolving Advances of the assigning Bank (unless it is assigning all its Commitment) and the assignee Bank pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with the Revolving Note subject to such assignment, and (v) each Eligible Assignee (other than the Eligible Assignee of the Agent or an Eligible Assignee which is an Affiliate of the assigning Bank) shall pay to the Agent a $3,000 administrative fee. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least three Business Days after the execution thereof unless otherwise agreed by the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance and the Agent, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto for all purposes and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder and (B) such Bank thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Bank may assign, as collateral or otherwise, any of its rights under the Credit Documents to any Federal Reserve Bank. (b) Term of Assignments.

(c) The Register. The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Bank from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Procedures.

Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for such Note or Notes, a new Revolving Note payable to the order of such Eligible Assignee in amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, and if the assigning Bank has retained any Commitment hereunder, a new Revolving Note payable to the order of such Bank in an amount equal to, respectively, the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the attached Exhibit H. (e) Participations. Each Bank may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it, its participation interest in the Letter of Credit Obligations and the Revolving Note held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes -75-

The Borrower hereby agrees that participants shall have the same rights under Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11(c) and 9.7 hereof as the Bank to the extent of their respective participations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the receipt of notice by the Borrower of the sale of a participation by any Bank to one or more banks or other entities (other than an Affiliate of such Bank) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (each such bank or other entity, a "Proposed Participant"), the Borrower shall have the right, but not the obligation, to select additional banks to replace such Proposed Participant on the same terms and conditions as the Proposed Participant upon prompt written notice from the Borrower to the Agent and the Bank selling such participation. The Borrower shall have ten days from the date of its receipt of notice of the proposed sale of such participation to the Proposed Participant to select replacement banks to replace such Proposed Participant. If the Borrower does not select any replacement banks or does not elect to select any replacement banks the applicable Bank may sell such participation to the Proposed Participant. (f) Confidentiality. Each Bank may furnish any information concerning the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants); provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries received by it from such Bank. Such Bank shall promptly deliver a signed copy of any such confidentiality agreement to the Borrower. Section 9.7 Indemnification. The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, the Banks (including any lender which was a Bank hereunder prior to any full assignment of its Commitment), the Issuing Banks and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and discharge, release and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from (a) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower of the proceeds of any Advance, (b) any breach by the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any Guarantor of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (c) any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (including any threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, or (d) any Environmental Claim or requirement of Environmental Laws concerning or relating to the present or previously-owned or operated properties, or the operations or business, of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Bank and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand, for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding; and EXPRESSLY INCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE INCURRED BY REASON OF THE -76-
PERSON BEING INDEMNIFIED'S OWN NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSES INCURRED BY REASON OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PERSON TO BE INDEMNIFIED. Section 9.8 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Section 9.9 Survival of Representations, Etc. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or made in writing by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Credit Documents, the making of the Advances and any investigation made by or on behalf of the Banks, none of which investigations shall diminish any Bank's right to rely on such representations and warranties. All obligations of the Borrower provided for in Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11(c) and 9.7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations. Section 9.10 Severability. In case one or more provisions of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. Section 9.11 Commercial Loans. The Borrower represents and warrants that the Advances are and shall be "Commercial Loans" as such term is used in Chapter 306 of the Texas Finance Code. In the event that applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, the ceiling shall be the indicated (weekly) ceiling and shall be used when appropriate in determining the Maximum Rate. Section 9.12 Usury Not Intended. It is the intent of the Borrower and each Bank in the execution and performance of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury laws, including conflicts of law concepts, governing the Advances of each Bank including such applicable laws of the State of Texas and the U.S. from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Banks and the Borrower stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate and that for purposes hereof "interest" shall include the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under such laws that are contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement; and in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts taken, reserved, charged, received or paid on the Advances include amounts which, by applicable law, are deemed interest which would exceed the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a mistake and each Bank receiving same shall credit the same on the principal of its Advances (or if such Advances shall have been paid in full, refund said excess to the Borrower). In the event that the maturity of the Advances is accelerated by reason of any election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that -77-
constitutes interest may never include more than the Maximum Rate and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the applicable Advances (or, if the applicable Advances shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrower). The provisions of this Section 9.12 shall control over all other provisions of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents which may be in apparent conflict herewith. Section 9.13 Governing Law. This Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas. Section 9.14 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Texas state or federal court sitting in Dallas, Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court. The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any right it may have to the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Borrower hereby agrees that service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to the Borrower at its address specified in Section 9.2. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 9.14 shall affect the rights of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrower or its Property in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Section 9.15 Banks not in Control. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in the Credit Documents shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Banks the right or power to exercise control over the affairs and/or management of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Guarantor, the power of the Banks being limited to the right to exercise the rights and remedies provided in the Credit Documents; provided, however, that if any Bank becomes the owner of any stock, or other equity interest in, any Person whether through foreclosure or otherwise, such Bank shall be entitled (subject to requirements of law) to exercise such legal rights as it may have by being owner of such stock, or other equity interest in, such Person. Section 9.16 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections, clauses and paragraphs of the Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Section 9.17 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. -78-
Section 9.18 Binding Arbitration. (a) Arbitration. The Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks agree, upon demand, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise arising out of or relating to in any way (i) this Agreement or the Credit Documents and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination; or (ii) requests for additional credit. (b) Governing Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in Texas selected by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"); (ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA's commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA's optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to, as applicable, as the "Rules"). If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any Person who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other Person shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other Person in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any Person that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar applicable state law. (c) No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any Person to (i) foreclose against real or personal property collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any Person to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 9.18(c). (d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of Texas with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The -79-
arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator's discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Texas and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Person, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other Person contests such action for judicial relief. (e) Discovery. In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date and within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the such Person's presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available. (f) Class Proceedings and Consolidations. The resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by a separate arbitration proceeding and such dispute shall not be consolidated with other disputes or included in any class proceeding. (g) Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding. (h) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators, the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other Person that is a party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a Person required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the Credit Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Credit Documents or any relationship between or among the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks. -80-

INTRODUCTION A. This Agreement is given in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2002 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented, renewed, extended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among Arkansas Best Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), Wells Fargo Bank Texas, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), Fleet National Bank and SunTrust Bank, as Co-Syndication Agents, Wachovia Corporation, as Documentation Agent, and the lenders parties thereto. B. The Borrower is the principal financing entity for all capital requirements of its Subsidiaries, and from time to time the Borrower has made and will continue to make capital contributions and advances to its Subsidiaries, including each of the parties hereto (such parties herein called individually a "Guarantor" and collectively the "Guarantors"). Each Guarantor is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Borrower and will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. C. Under the Credit Agreement, it is a condition to the making of the Advances by the Banks and the issuance of the Letters of Credit by the Issuing Bank that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Agreement. Therefore, in order to induce the Banks to make the Advances and the Issuing Bank to issue the Letters of Credit, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: Section 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. Section 2. Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all indebtedness, liabilities and/or obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, the Notes and any other Credit Document, whether for principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise (such indebtedness, liabilities and/or obligations being hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Agent or any Bank in enforcing any rights under this Agreement. Each Guarantor agrees that its guaranty obligation under this Agreement is a guarantee of payment, not of collection, and that such Guarantor is primarily liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 1
Section 3. Limit of Liability. Each Guarantor shall be liable under this Agreement with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations only for amounts aggregating up to the largest amount that would not render its guaranty obligation hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law. Section 4. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or the Banks with respect thereto. The liability of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Credit Agreement or any Credit Document; (c) any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other agreement or guaranty, for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (d) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a Guarantor. Section 5. Continuation and Reinstatement, Etc. Each Guarantor agrees that, to the extent that the Borrower makes payments to the Agent or any Bank and such payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or otherwise required to be repaid, then to the extent of such repayment the Guaranteed Obligations shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date such initial payment occurred. The Guarantor shall defend and indemnify the Agent and each Bank from and against any claim or loss under this Section 5 (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in the defense of any such action or suit. Section 6. Certain Waivers. 6.01. Notice. Each Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, notice of acceleration, notice of intent to accelerate and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Agreement. 6.02. Other Remedies. Each Guarantor hereby waives any requirement that the Agent or any Bank exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person, including any action required by Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 2
6.03. Waiver of Subrogation. (a) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, until payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations and termination of all Commitments, any claim or other rights which it may acquire against the Borrower that arise from such Guarantor's obligations under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation (including, without limitation, any statutory rights of subrogation under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 509, or otherwise), reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Bank against the Borrower which the Agent or any Bank now has or acquires. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in full and all of the Commitments terminated, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks, and shall promptly be paid to the Agent for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as the Agent may elect. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that the waiver set forth in this Section 6.03(a) is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. (b) Each Guarantor further agrees that it will not enter into any agreement providing, directly or indirectly, for any contribution, reimbursement, repayment or indemnity by the Borrower or any other Person on account of any payment by such Guarantor to the Agent or the Banks under this Agreement. Section 7. Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as follows: 7.01. Corporate Authority. Such Guarantor is a corporation or a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, which is set forth on Schedule 4.1 to the Credit Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement are within such Guarantor's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene or violate (a) such Guarantor's charter or bylaws or (b) any law or material contractual restriction affecting such Guarantor or its Property. 7.02. Government Approval. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement. 7.03. Binding Obligations. This Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Section 8. Covenants. Each Guarantor will comply with all covenant provisions of Article V and Article VI of the Credit Agreement to the extent such provisions are applicable to a Subsidiary of the Borrower. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 3
Section 9. Contribution. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, each of the Guarantors will benefit, directly and indirectly, from the Obligations and in consideration thereof desire to enter into a contribution agreement among themselves as set forth in this Section 9 to allocate such benefits among themselves and to provide a fair and equitable arrangement to make contributions in the event any payment is made by any Guarantor hereunder to the Agent or the Banks (such payment being referred to herein as a "Contribution"). The Guarantors hereby agree as follows: 9.01. Calculation of Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Guarantors in the event any Contribution is made by a Guarantor (a "Funding Guarantor"), such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from certain other Guarantors for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in discharging any of the Obligations, in the manner and to the extent set forth in this Section 9.01. The amount of any Contribution under this Agreement shall be equal to the payment made by the Funding Guarantor to the Agent or any other beneficiary pursuant to this Agreement and shall be determined as of the date on which such payment is made. 9.02. Benefit Amount Defined. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Benefit Amount" of any Guarantor as of any date of determination shall be the net value of the benefits to such Guarantor and all of its Subsidiaries (including any Subsidiaries which may be Guarantors) from extensions of credit made by the Banks to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement; provided, that in determining the contribution liability of any Guarantor which is a Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent corporation or of any Guarantor to its direct or indirect Subsidiary, the Benefit Amount of such Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries, if any, shall be subtracted in determining the Benefit Amount of the parent corporation. Such benefits shall include benefits of funds constituting proceeds of Advances made to the Borrower by the Banks which are in turn advanced or contributed by the Borrower to such Guarantor or its Subsidiaries and benefits of Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement on behalf of, or the proceeds of which are advanced or contributed or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Benefits"). In the case of any proceeds of Advances or Benefits advanced or contributed to a Person of which any of the equity interests are owned directly or indirectly by a Guarantor (an "Owned Entity"), the Benefit Amount of a Guarantor with respect thereto shall be that portion of the net value of the benefits attributable to Advances or Benefits equal to the direct or indirect percentage ownership of such Guarantor in its Owned Entity. 9.03. Contribution Obligation. Each Guarantor shall be liable to a Funding Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of (a) (i) the ratio of the Benefit Amount of such Guarantor to the total amount of Obligations, multiplied by (ii) the amount of Obligations paid by such Funding Guarantor and (b) 95% of the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities) determined as of the date on which the payment made by a Funding Guarantor is deemed made for purposes of this Agreement (giving effect to all payments made by other Funding Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions). Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 4
9.04. Allocation. In the event that at any time there exists more than one Funding Guarantor with respect to any Contribution (in any such case, the "Applicable Contribution"), then payment from other Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among such Funding Guarantors in proportion to the total amount of the Contribution made for or on account of the Borrower by each such Funding Guarantor pursuant to the Applicable Contribution. In the event that at any time any Guarantor pays an amount under this Agreement in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to clause (a) of Section 9.03, that Guarantor shall be deemed to be a Funding Guarantor to the extent of such excess and shall be entitled to contribution from the other Guarantors in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.04. 9.05. Subsidiary Payment. The amount of contribution payable under this Section 9.05 by any Guarantor shall be reduced by the amount of any contribution paid hereunder by a Subsidiary of such Guarantor. 9.06. Equitable Allocation. If as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization or other corporate change in the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or as a result of any amendment, waiver or modification of the terms and conditions of other Sections of this Agreement or the Obligations, or for any other reason, the contributions under this Section 9.06 become inequitable as among the Guarantors, the Guarantors shall promptly modify and amend this Section 9.06 to provide for an equitable allocation of contributions. Any of the foregoing modifications and amendments shall be in writing and signed by all Guarantors. 9.07. Asset of Party to Which Contribution is Owing. The Guarantors acknowledge that the right to contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the Guarantor to which such contribution is owing. 9.08. Subordination. No payments payable by a Guarantor pursuant to the terms of this Section 9 shall be paid until all amounts then due and payable by the Borrower to any Bank, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Documents, are paid in full in cash. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall affect the indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of any Guarantor to the Agent or any Bank under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Documents. Section 10. Miscellaneous. 10.01. Addresses for Notices. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing, including telegraphic communication, and delivered or teletransmitted to the Agent, as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and to each Guarantor, at the address set forth beside such Guarantor's name on Annex 1 hereto or in the Accession Agreement executed by such Guarantor, or to such other address as shall be designated by any Guarantor or the Agent in written notice to the other parties. All such notices and other communications shall be effective when delivered or teletransmitted to the above addresses. 10.02. Amendments, Etc. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Agent, the Majority Banks and the Borrower, and no amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Guarantor and the Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks; provided, however, that any amendment Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 5
or waiver releasing any Guarantor from any liability hereunder shall be signed by all the Banks; provided, further, however, that any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Subsidiary of the Borrower hereafter is required in a accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or otherwise agrees to become a guarantor of the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Documents, then such Subsidiary may become a party to this Agreement by executing an Accession Agreement ("Accession Agreement") in the form attached hereto as Annex 2, and each Guarantor and the Agent hereby agrees that, upon such Subsidiary's execution of such Accession Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been amended to make such Person a Guarantor hereunder for all purposes and a party hereto and no signature is required on behalf of the other Guarantors or the Agent to make such an amendment to this Agreement effective. 10.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Agent or any Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 10.04. Right of Set-Off. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent and the Banks are hereby authorized at any time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and other indebtedness owing by the Agent or the Banks to the account of any Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of such Guarantor under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or the Banks shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. The Agent and the Banks agree promptly to notify each Guarantor affected by any such set-off after any such set-off and application made by the Agent or the Banks provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Agent and the Banks under this Section 10.04 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Agent and the Banks may have. 10.05. Continuing Guaranty; Transfer of Interest. This Agreement shall create a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full and termination of the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors, and assigns, and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent, the Banks and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause, when any Bank assigns or otherwise transfers any interest held by it under the Credit Agreement or other Credit Document to any other Person pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement or other Credit Document, that other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits held by such Bank under this Agreement. Subject to Section 5, upon the payment in full and termination of the Guaranteed Obligations, the guaranties granted hereby shall terminate and all rights hereunder shall revert to each Guarantor to the extent such rights have not been applied pursuant to the terms hereof. Subject to Section 5, upon any such termination, the Agent will, at each Guarantor's expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor shall reasonably request and take any other actions reasonably requested to evidence or effect such termination.

10.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Texas state or federal court sitting in Dallas, Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any right it may have to the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to such Guarantor at its address specified below. Each Guarantor agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 10.06 shall affect the rights of any Bank or the Agent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by the law or affect the right of any Bank or the Agent to bring any action or proceeding against any Guarantor or its Property in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 10.07. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY OR TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. 10.08. Binding Arbitration. (a) Arbitration. The Guarantors and the Agent agree, upon demand, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise arising out of or relating to in any way this Agreement or the Credit Documents and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination. (b) Governing Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in Texas selected by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"); (ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA's commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA's optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to, as applicable, as the "Rules"). If there is any Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 7
inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any Person who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other Person shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other Person in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any Person that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar applicable state law. (c) No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any Person to (i) foreclose against real or personal property collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any Person to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 10.08(c) . (d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of Texas with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator's discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Texas and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Person, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other Person contests such action for judicial relief. (e) Discovery. In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date and within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 8
Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the such Person's presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available. (f) Class Proceedings and Consolidations. The resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by a separate arbitration proceeding and such dispute shall not be consolidated with other disputes or included in any class proceeding. (g) Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding. (h) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators, the Guarantors and the Agent shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other Person that is a party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a Person required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the Guarantors and the Agent potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to this Agreement or the Credit Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Credit Documents or any relationship between or among the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and/or the Banks. 10.09 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO SECTION 26.02 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LOAN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT EXCEEDS $50,000 IN VALUE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNLESS THE LOAN AGREEMENT IS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTY TO BE BOUND OR THAT PARTY'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.

In connection with this Agreement, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 9
(a) The payment of any and all principal of and interest on the Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined below) shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment and enforcement to the prior payment and enforcement in full of all Guaranteed Obligations as provided in this Section 10.10. The Subordinated Indebtedness shall not be payable, and no payment of principal, interest or other amounts on account thereof, and no property or guaranty of any nature to secure, guarantee or pay the Subordinated Indebtedness shall be made or given, directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any Debtor (hereafter defined) or received, accepted, retained or applied by any Guarantor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been irrevocably paid and performed in full. If any sums shall be paid to any Guarantor or any Affiliate of a Guarantor by any Debtor or any other Person on account of the Subordinated Indebtedness when such payment is not permitted hereunder, such sums shall be held in trust by such Guarantor or such Affiliate of a Guarantor for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks and shall forthwith be delivered to the Agent without affecting the liability of such Guarantor or such Affiliate of a Guarantor under this Agreement and may be applied by the Agent against the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Upon the request of the Agent, each Guarantor shall execute, deliver and endorse to the Agent such documentation as the Agent may request to perfect, preserve and enforce its rights hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement and with respect to each Guarantor, the term "Subordinated Indebtedness" means all indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower other than such Guarantor (the Borrower and such Subsidiaries of the Borrower hereinafter called the "Debtors") to such Guarantor, whether such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations now exist or are hereafter incurred or arise, or are primary, absolute, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed, contingent, liquidated, unliquidated, secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, joint, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of whether such indebtedness, liabilities or obligations are evidenced by a note, contract, open account or otherwise, and irrespective of the Person or Persons in whose favor such indebtedness, obligations or liabilities may, at their inception, have been, or may hereafter be created, or the manner in which they have been or may hereafter be acquired by such Guarantor; (b) Any and all Liens (including any judgment Liens) upon any Debtor's property or assets securing payment of any Subordinated Indebtedness (the "Subordinated Liens") shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any and all Liens, if any exist, upon any Debtor's assets securing payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, regardless of whether such Subordinated Liens presently exist or are hereafter created or when such Subordinated Liens were created, perfected, filed or recorded. Each Guarantor shall not exercise or enforce any creditors' rights or remedies that it may have against any Debtor or foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise institute any action or proceeding (whether judicial or otherwise, including, without limitation, the commencement of, or joinder in, any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, receivership or other debtor relief law) to enforce any Subordinated Lien on any property or assets of any Debtor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been irrevocably paid and performed in full; (c) In the event of any receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, rearrangement, debtor's relief or other insolvency proceeding involving any Debtor as debtor, the Agent shall have the right to prove and vote any claim under the Subordinated Indebtedness and to receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian all dividends, distributions and Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 10
payments made in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness until the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid and performed in full. The Agent may apply any such dividends, distributions and payments against the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the Credit Agreement; (d) All promissory notes, accounts receivable, ledgers, records or any other evidence of Subordinated Indebtedness, and all mortgages, deeds of trust, security agreements, assignments and other security documents evidencing the Subordinated Liens, shall contain a specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness and Liens evidenced thereby are subordinated under the terms of this Agreement; and (e) The terms and provisions of this Section 10.10 are given by each Guarantor as additional rights, remedies and benefits to any and all other subordination agreements heretofore, concurrently herewith or hereafter executed by such Guarantor to or in favor of the Agent or any Bank, and nothing in this Agreement shall ever be deemed to in any way negate or replace any other such previous, concurrent or subsequent subordination agreements.

EXHIBIT K FORM OF BORROWER'S/GUARANTORS' COUNSEL OPINION May 15, 2002 To Each of the Banks Party to the Credit Agreement and Wells Fargo Bank Texas, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks Ladies and Gentlemen: I have acted as counsel to Arkansas Best Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and the Guarantors in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, the lending institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), Fleet National Bank and SunTrust Bank, as Co-Syndication Agents, Wachovia Corporation, as Documentation Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank Texas, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Agent"). I have been requested to render this opinion pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iv) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. For purposes of this opinion, the Borrower and the Guarantors are collectively referred to as the "Loan Parties". In connection with this opinion, I have examined and relied upon the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate documents and records of the Loan Parties and have received such information from officers and representatives of the Loan Parties as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable me to express the opinions expressed below. I have also relied on certificates of officers of the Loan Parties and certificates of public officials as to certain factual matters. For purposes of this opinion, I have also examined each of the Credit Documents. In rendering my opinion, I have assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures, (b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, (c) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, and (d) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents referred to herein by the parties thereto other than the Loan Parties.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth below, and as may be disclosed in the Credit Documents, I am of the opinion that: 1. Each of the Loan Parties is a corporation duly incorporated or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdictions of its incorporation or organization (as applicable). 2. Each of the Loan Parties has the requisite power to own or hold under lease its assets and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. 3. Each of the Loan Parties is duly qualified as a foreign entity and is authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of any of the Loan Parties. 4. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending or threatened against or affecting any of the Loan Parties or the rights of any of the Loan Parties which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, operations or business of any of the Loan Parties or the ability of any of the Loan Parties to perform its respective obligations under the Credit Documents. 5. None of (a) the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents, (b) the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, or (c) compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will (i) violate or result in a breach of, or require any consent under, the certificate or articles, as the case may be, of incorporation or organization or bylaws or other constitutional document of any of the Loan Parties, or any law or regulation applicable to any of the Loan Parties, or any of their respective properties, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or Governmental Authority or agency known to us after due inquiry, (ii) violate or result in a breach of or a default under any material agreement, document or instrument to which any of the Loan Parties is a party or by which any of the Loan Parties or their respective properties are bound, known to us after due inquiry (a "Material Contract"), or (iii) except for the Liens permitted by the Agreement, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the revenues or assets of any of the Loan Parties pursuant to the terms of any such Material Contract. 6. Each of the Loan Parties has all necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Loan Parties of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and the obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action. 7. Each of the Credit Documents to which any Loan Party is a party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Loan Party and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Loan Party enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, except that the enforceability thereof may be limited (a) by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 8. No authorizations, approvals or consents of, or filings or registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency are necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by any of the Loan Parties of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, except for authorizations, consents and approvals that have already been obtained and filings which have already been made. 9. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). 10. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 11. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary of a holding company" or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "public utility" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. The opinions expressed herein are as of the date hereof only, and I assume no obligation to update or supplement such opinions to reflect any fact or circumstance that may hereafter come to my attention or any change in law that may occur or become effective. The foregoing opinion is, with your concurrence, predicated upon and qualified in its entirety by the following: I am a member of the Bar of the State of Arkansas, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction, other than the Federal Laws of the United States of America, the Laws of the State of Arkansas, and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Insofar as the foregoing opinion
involves agreements that purport to be governed by Texas or other states' laws, I have assumed that such law is the same as the Law of the State of Arkansas. This opinion is solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon by any person other than you and your counsel and any of your assignees and participants. Very truly yours, Richard F. Cooper

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ITS SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (Fort Smith, Arkansas, August 13, 2002) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (NASDAQ/NMS - - "ABFS") ("the Company") announced today that it had reached a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of all outstanding issues relating to the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1990 through 1994. As a result of the settlement, the Company will reduce reserves for interest by approximately $5.2 million to reflect the reduction in the Company's liability for future cash payments of interest. The primary issue raised by the IRS related to the timing of the deductibility of contributions made to multiemployer pension plans by ABF Freight System, Inc.(R), the Company's principal operating subsidiary. The effect of this change will be recorded in the third quarter of 2002 and will result in an increase in the Company's net income per diluted common share of approximately $0.12 cents. The tax assessments were previously proposed by the IRS for the years involved. Reserves for the proposed assessments were recorded in prior years as information became available regarding the IRS position on the issues involved. Substantially all interest and taxes relating to the years involved were paid in 2001 as an advance payment to stop the continuing accrual of interest. The net current cash impact of the settlement will not be significant. Contact: Mr. David E. Loeffler, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Telephone: (479) 785-6157 Mr. David Humphrey, Director of Investor Relations Telephone: (479) 785-6200 END OF RELEASE

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ABF(R) PRESIDENT AND CEO DAVID E. STUBBLEFIELD TO RETIRE IN 2003; ROBERT A. DAVIDSON NAMED HIS SUCCESSOR (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 16, 2002) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced that David E. Stubblefield, current President and Chief Executive Officer of its largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System Inc.(R), will be retiring on January 31, 2003. Robert A. Davidson will become ABF's President and Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2003. Mr. Stubblefield joined ABF(R) in 1959 as a local sales representative in the Little Rock, Arkansas freight facility. During his career Mr. Stubblefield worked in ABF's Transportation Department, was ABF's Director of Research and Planning, headed Data-Tronics Corporation which is Arkansas Best's information technology subsidiary, was the Treasurer of Arkansas Best and its various subsidiary companies, and served for fifteen years as the Senior Vice President of Marketing for ABF. Since 1995, Mr. Stubblefield has served as ABF's President and Chief Executive Officer. "In the late 50s my father, Robert A. Young, Jr., hired David Stubblefield as a freight salesman for ABF after a chance meeting while giving him a ride to the wedding of a mutual friend," said Robert A. Young, III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "Thus began a 43-year career with ABF that saw Dave positively affect all of the key areas of our company. David Stubblefield has truly helped shape ABF into the successful company that it is today. Dave's influence and knowledge allowed ABF to effectively integrate numerous acquisitions throughout its history, including two companies that were larger than ABF at the time. When deregulation of the LTL industry in the early 80s dictated a new competitive philosophy to insure survival, David Stubblefield guided important changes in ABF's sales and pricing initiatives. As a result, ABF is one of only six of the fifty largest LTL carriers in 1980 to remain in business today. After becoming ABF's President and Chief Executive Officer, David Stubblefield led the company through the successful integration of its last major acquisition in late 1995 and 1996 and helped ABF achieve record profits in recent years," said Mr. Young. "As I look at ABF today and consider Dave's positive influence and his vision in guiding our company, I am so thankful that my father offered that ride to him so many years ago. Now at age 65, with Dave stepping down to devote his full attention to his wife Suzanne, their two children and ten grandchildren, we thank him for his service to our company and wish him good health and many blessings." "It is an honor to follow David Stubblefield and to have the opportunity to build upon his remarkable tenure at ABF," said Robert Davidson. "His people-centered management style has fostered enthusiastic, empowered employees at every level of our company. The management team developed by Dave is widely known as the most capable in the industry, and his high ethical standards have shown us the true measure of success. Dave's legacy leaves ABF positioned for continued success, and we are truly thankful to have served with him." Robert Davidson is currently ABF's Vice President of Marketing and Pricing. He has been employed in the corporation for thirty years, beginning his career with Arkansas Best in 1972 in the Economic Analysis Department. In 1982, he became ABF's Vice President of Pricing and subsequently added the title of Vice President of Marketing in 1997. Mr. Davidson, who is 54 years old, holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Arkansas.
"I am pleased to have Bob Davidson leading ABF Freight System into the future," said Mr. Young. "During the last twenty years, his development and implementation of ABF's account pricing principles have helped make ABF the most profitable long-haul, LTL carrier in the United States. Under Bob's guidance since 1997, ABF's Marketing Department has successfully positioned ABF as the most flexible, customer-oriented carrier in the LTL industry, offering unmatched value to the shipping public. In addition, Bob has overseen the introduction of numerous new services at ABF and the development of abf.com which has been consistently recognized for its innovation by numerous independent organizations," said Mr. Young. "I am confident that ABF will reach new levels of excellence under Bob's leadership." "Bob Davidson has reported directly to me for twenty-three of his thirty years at ABF," said David Stubblefield. "Bob is fully prepared for this challenge and I have complete confidence in his ability to lead the company. I have been planning for retirement with the expectation that ABF will achieve even greater success in the future."

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION REPORTS 4TH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2002 RESULTS, ABF(R)'S 4TH QUARTER OPERATING RATIO IS 92.2% (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 21, 2003) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced fourth quarter 2002 net income of $14.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, compared to fourth quarter 2001 net income of $9.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share. The fourth quarter figures for 2001 included a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) resulting from the resolution of certain tax contingencies originating in prior years. For the full year of 2002, the company reported income, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change, of $40.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share (net income of $16.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share after the accounting change) versus 2001 net income of $41.4 million, or $1.66 per diluted common share. "Arkansas Best's solid performance during 2002 validated its position as the company with the strongest financial position in the long-haul, LTL industry," said Robert A. Young, III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "ABF(R) continued to produce good results with a fourth quarter operating ratio of 92.2%. Clipper was profitable during the quarter while improving its operating ratio by three percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter," said Mr. Young. ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. ABF's fourth quarter 2002 revenue was $344.9 million compared to $302.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. ABF's operating income during the current quarter was $27.1 million compared to $16.5 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter-billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $22.56, an increase of 5.9% over the fourth quarter 2001 figure of $21.30. "The closure of CF has strengthened overall pricing stability in our industry," said Mr. Young. "ABF's ability to secure 1
customer rate increases has improved. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the average percent of rate increase obtained on deferred pricing agreements was better than that for any quarter since the third quarter of 2000 and was almost a full percentage point better than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2001." "In an environment where a major competitor goes out of business, ABF's profitability and strong financial position have been advantages in the marketplace," said Mr. Young. "We've seen that value is even more important to our customers, and they are displaying a greater appreciation of financial stability in their transportation partners." Fourth quarter 2002 LTL tonnage per day increased 6.5% when compared to the 2001 fourth quarter. "During the first eight months of 2002, prior to the closure of CF, ABF's LTL pounds per day was 7% below the same eight-month period in 2001. During the four-month period from September through December of 2002, following CF's closure, ABF's LTL pounds per day was 6% above the same four-month period in 2001. Comparing these two time periods results in an increase in tonnage trends of 13%," said Mr. Young. "It has been difficult to distinguish the exact amount of business ABF has obtained directly from the CF closure," said Mr. Young. "Additional factors, including the economic environment and the settlement of the longshoremen's west coast labor dispute, also impacted ABF's fourth quarter tonnage levels. When business levels increase with customers ABF had prior to CF's closure, it is impossible to know which factor caused the change. Some of the additional freight that can be identified as coming from CF is not as profitable as ABF's average business. However, this business has contributed positively to ABF's margins because of the operating leverage that was available throughout the ABF network. As usual, pricing on accounts identified with less-than-acceptable margins is currently being addressed. During the fourth quarter, ABF had better success in securing price increases and retaining this business." LTL shipments per day in two-day transit time lanes increased 6.7% compared to an increase of 12.3% in ABF's longer haul business. "The majority of freight that ABF received as a result of the CF closure was in the 'three-day and beyond' service lanes," said Mr. Young. As seen throughout 2002, fourth quarter productivity of ABF's dock employees, city drivers and yard personnel improved over the same period in 2001. For the full year of 2002, ABF's revenue was $1.28 billion, essentially the same as in 2001. ABF's 2002 operating ratio was 94.6% versus a 93.8% in 2001. ABF's 2002 operating income was 2
$68.8 million versus $79.4 million during 2001. Total tonnage per day in 2002 decreased 4.2% compared to 2001. LTL tonnage per day during 2002 decreased 2.8% from 2001 levels and truckload tonnage per day experienced a decline of 9.6% versus 2001. "During 2002, ABF's total insurance costs, including those for workers' compensation and bodily injury/property damage (BI/PD), increased by over $13 million versus 2001. This was related to various factors including the effects of the terrorist attacks on our nation, increased costs in the re-insurance market and continually rising healthcare costs," said Mr. Young. "These additional expenses added over one percentage point to ABF's 2002 operating ratio. Without this cost increase, ABF's 2002 operating ratio would have been better than its operating ratio in 2001." ABF's 2003 costs for workers' compensation and BI/PD premiums and claims should remain consistent with 2002, assuming similar claims experience and considering cost differences that occur because of changes in business levels. However, for 2003, Arkansas Best has increased its BI/PD self-insured retention layer from $500,000 to $1,000,000 per claim. "ABF continues to reduce its transit time standards in order to more effectively handle customer shipments in a timely manner," said Mr. Young. "Additional operational changes implemented in ABF's network during December allowed transit times to decrease in over 15% of ABF's service lanes. Generally, ABF's long-haul lanes were improved. These most recent changes, combined with previously announced improvements in many of ABF's short-haul lanes, resulted in service standard improvements in approximately 62% of ABF's terminal-to-terminal lanes since April 1999." "In December, ABF was named by Selling Power magazine as one of the top three companies to sell for in the service sector of the United States economy. ABF was also named in the top five of the best 50 companies to sell for overall. Through training and the use of technology, including ABF's award-winning Web tools, ABF's sales force provides personal, direct attention to our customers' individual needs," said Mr. Young. "The effectiveness of our sales force is a huge reason why many customers choose ABF." "As previously announced, on January 31 ABF will say goodbye to its President and Chief Executive Officer, David Stubblefield, after 43 years of service," said Mr. Young. "ABF is the company that it is today in large part because of Dave's positive influence throughout these many years. Dave, we thank you for what you have meant to ABF and Arkansas Best. We wish you years of happiness and good health in the future!" 3
CLIPPER For the fourth quarter of 2002, Clipper had revenues of $30.3 million versus $29.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Clipper's fourth quarter 2002 operating ratio was 98.9% versus 101.9% during the fourth quarter of 2001. "During the quarter, Clipper's temperature-controlled division experienced the traditional downturn in its produce business, but this was offset by a program to lease refrigerated trailers to grocery chains during the holiday season," said Mr. Young. "Overall, Clipper's fourth quarter was positively impacted by earning rebates achieved from increased business levels with the railroads." For the full year 2002, revenues at Clipper were $118.9 million compared to $127.3 million during 2001. Clipper's 2002 operating ratio was 99.1% compared to 99.6% last year. "Clipper's LTL and full-load divisions both experienced reductions in yearly revenue due to the effects of the general economic decline and Clipper's continued efforts to improve its mix of accounts," said Mr. Young. "In spite of this revenue decrease, Clipper was able to increase its 2002 operating income by $670,000 versus 2001," said Mr. Young. "This was primarily due to higher utilization of rail in linehaul movements and cost-efficient handling of customer shipments in service lanes between major cities." "During 2001, when Clipper's revenues first declined due to the elimination of unprofitable customer accounts, we believed this would eventually help improve Clipper's overall profitability. The 2002 results indicate that this is beginning to happen. When the economic environment improves and more business becomes available, Clipper's emphasis on individual account profitability should translate into further margin improvements," said Mr. Young. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2003, Arkansas Best forecasts net capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. Expenditures anticipated for 2003 are above last year's net capital expenditure total of $46 million due primarily to planned purchases of replacement trailers for both ABF and Clipper. "So far, ABF has not been the successful bidder on any of the CF properties that have been sold in previous auctions," said Mr. Young. "ABF continues to be interested in a few of the remaining, unsold CF facilities throughout the United States. We anticipate that the remaining properties, in which we have an interest, have market values of approximately $2 million - $3 million in total." 4
Arkansas Best's depreciation and amortization for 2003 is forecasted to be approximately $52 million. WINGFOOT "PUT PRICE" ADJUSTMENT As previously announced, Arkansas Best entered into a joint venture agreement with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company that resulted in the formation of Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC. Arkansas Best has the right to sell its 19% ownership interest in Wingfoot to Goodyear at any time after April 30, 2003 and before April 30, 2004. Goodyear made a claim against Arkansas Best under the indemnity provisions of the joint venture contract. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2002, Goodyear and Arkansas Best agreed to an amendment to the contract, reducing the "Put Price" by $2.1 million and increasing Goodyear's liability exposure by $2.1 million. The amended "Put Price" is $71.3 million and Arkansas Best's potential gain in 2003 from exercising the "Put" is $12 million rather than $14 million. PENSION AND SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION As previously reported, Arkansas Best contributed $5.6 million to the ABF non-union pension plan during the third quarter of 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Arkansas Best received approval from the Internal Revenue Service to change its 2002 plan valuation date from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, thus allowing 2002 stock market losses to be considered in the measurement of the amount of allowed tax-deductible contributions to the companies' non-union pension plans. This change allowed Arkansas Best to make contributions of $10 million to its non-union pension plans in December. As a result, these pension plans are fully funded. For certain designated participants, Arkansas Best has an unfunded supplemental pension plan which supplements benefits under its non-union pension plans. At the end of 2002, Arkansas Best recorded, through equity, an after-tax minimum liability of $3.5 million associated with this supplemental plan. This liability resulted partially from a decline in interest rates, which increased plan liabilities. As a result of three years of market declines, Arkansas Best has evaluated its pension plan assumptions and will use 7.90% as its 2003 investment return assumption and 6.90% as its discount rate assumption for 2003 plan liabilities. These rates compare to 9% for investment returns and 7.55% for plan liabilities for 2002. 5
FORBES MAGAZINE HONOR For the third year in a row, Forbes magazine named Arkansas Best Corporation as one of the Platinum 400 Best Big Companies in America. In its January 6, 2003 issue, Arkansas Best was included as one of thirteen companies in the "Travel & Transport" industry sector. "We are pleased to be included in this distinguished group of U.S. companies again this year," said Mr. Young.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION SENDS GOODYEAR NOTICE TO SELL ITS INTEREST IN WINGFOOT; WILL TAKE A FIRST QUARTER 2003 CHARGE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP (Fort Smith, Arkansas, March 19, 2003) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) announced today that it has notified The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company of its intention to sell its 19% ownership interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC to Goodyear for a cash price of $71.3 million. Arkansas Best anticipates closing the transaction and receiving the proceeds from Goodyear on or about May 1, 2003. Upon the closing of the transaction, Arkansas Best expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $12 million ($8.4 million after-tax or $0.33 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003. Arkansas Best expects to use the proceeds to reduce the outstanding debt under its credit agreement, which currently stands at $110.0 million. Arkansas Best has hedged the variable rate interest payments on $110.0 million of borrowings under its revolving credit agreement with an interest rate swap. Because Arkansas Best anticipates using the proceeds from this transaction to reduce borrowings below $110.0 million, Arkansas Best will recognize a pre-tax charge of approximately $8.5 million ($5.2 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted common share) to earnings in its first quarter 2003 income statement related to the current negative fair value of the swap. The fair value of the interest rate swap may change between now and the end of the first quarter. If such changes occur, they will be reflected in Arkansas Best's first quarter 2003 earnings. Arkansas Best Corporation, headquartered in Fort Smith, AR, is a diversified transportation holding company with two primary operating subsidiaries. ABF Freight System, Inc., in continuous service since 1923, provides national transportation of less-than-truckload ("LTL") general commodities throughout North America. Clipper is an intermodal marketing company that provides domestic freight services utilizing rail and over-the-road transportation.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS 99.1 Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated April 21, 2003

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS; ABF(R)'S OPERATING RATIO IS 96.6% (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 21, 2003) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced that it had a first quarter 2003 net loss of $734,000, or $0.03 per common share which included a $9.0 million pre-tax ($0.22 per common share) charge related to Arkansas Best's interest rate swap on $110.0 million of the company's borrowings. At the end of this month, a significant amount of that debt will be paid off using the proceeds associated with Arkansas Best's sale of its interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Following this payment by Goodyear, Arkansas Best's debt will be substantially below the $110.0 million level on which interest payments were hedged with the interest rate swap. As a result, until the interest rate swap matures on April 1, 2005, it will be accounted for in Arkansas Best's income statement. ABF Freight System(R), the company's largest subsidiary, had a first quarter 2003 operating ratio of 96.6 which was 1.5 percentage points better than in the first quarter of 2002. First quarter 2003 operating income at ABF was $11.1 million compared to $5.5 million during the first quarter of 2002. "While ABF's first quarter profits doubled in a sluggish economy, their results could have been even better had they not experienced unusually severe weather and incurred higher workers' compensation costs," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. On a per share basis, adverse weather accounted for approximately $0.05 per common share and workers' compensation costs amounted to $0.06 per common share. For the first quarter of 2002, income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to goodwill impairment was $1.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share. Including the non-cash impairment charge of $23.9 million ($0.95 per diluted common share, net of taxes), which was related to impaired goodwill associated with its Clipper subsidiary, Arkansas Best had a first quarter 2002 net loss of $22.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted common share.
ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. ABF's revenue during the first quarter of 2003 was $324.2 million, a per-day increase of 12.3%, compared to first quarter 2002 revenue of $288.6 million. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $22.54, an increase of 6.4% over last year's first quarter figure of $21.19. Approximately one-half of this increase was a result of changes in the profile of freight handled. These changes have occurred, primarily, as a result of business ABF added following the September 2002 closure of Consolidated Freightways. ABF's LTL tonnage per day increased 2.7% during the first three months of 2003 compared to the same period last year. This is approximately 1.6 percentage points less than would have been expected based on normal seasonal trends from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. "In the first quarter, ABF continued to maintain pricing discipline," said Mr. Young. "Though tonnage levels are soft, ABF does not intend to handle additional freight that does not contribute profitably to the bottom line." During this year's first quarter, ABF was adversely affected by unusually bad weather. A major storm in the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Atlantic Coast regions around February 17 closed three of ABF's distribution centers and three of ABF's major line-haul relay locations for almost two days. In addition, 38 of ABF's service centers were fully or partially closed due to this storm. Operations were also affected by storms in the Southeast during mid-January and in the Rocky Mountain region during mid-March. The impact on operating income of lost revenue and increased costs at ABF related to the first quarter bad weather was approximately $2.0 million. "The unfavorable weather ABF experienced during this year's first quarter was the worst we've seen during this period in the last three or four years," said Mr. Young. "The February 17 storm was particularly severe because it shut down several key locations in ABF's network, disrupting freight flows across the system." During the first quarter of 2003, workers' compensation costs were $2.5 million greater than in the first quarter of 2002 due primarily to deterioration in claims experience resulting from more increases on existing claims and greater severity of new claims. The increase in new claim severity was related to two large ABF workers' compensation claims whose costs totaled $1.1 million.
ABF's non-union pension expense increased by approximately $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2003. This quarterly figure was in line with Arkansas Best's previous statement that it anticipated these costs to increase by approximately $4.0 million in 2003 versus 2002. ABF's non-union salary expense increased by $1.4 million during the first quarter of 2003, due to the normal annual cost-of-living increases. Compared to the first quarter of 2002, average daily shipments moving in two-day transit time lanes increased 1.2% versus a 9.4% increase in ABF's longer-haul business. "Changes in these statistics continue to be affected by the longer-haul profile of business added as a result of the CF closure," said Mr. Young. "ABF's level of dock, street and yard productivity was negatively impacted by the quarter's bad weather," said Mr. Young. "Productivity measures at ABF were about one percent less than in the same period last year, with greater negative effects on fringe costs." "In addition to the impact of adverse weather on ABF's business, it appears that the economy has experienced some deterioration in the last few months," said Mr. Young. "Since last September, it has been difficult for ABF to differentiate the impact of additional CF business and the changes in the economy. However, it does appear that the economy has moderately declined during the last few months," said Mr. Young. "ABF will continue to maintain its emphasis on individual account profitability when reviewing existing business and when considering potential new business. As a result, ABF will be well positioned when economic factors do improve." On March 28, the Motor Freight Carriers Association, the national trade association representing the unionized general freight carriers, announced that the new National Master Freight Agreement had received an overwhelming ratification vote from the freight membership of the Teamsters Union and from the member carriers. This contract, which took effect on April 1 of this year, will provide ABF with labor agreement stability for the next five years. On March 31, as previously announced, Brian Shutt, manager of security for ABF Freight System, was selected by the American Trucking Associations (ATA) as the 2003 "Security Professional of the Year." According to the ATA, this new award was created "to honor and reward the significant achievements and contributions of individuals who reduce cargo theft and implement a strong security program." "We are proud of Brian's recognition by the trucking industry," said Mr. Young.
On April 9, ATA also announced the 2003 America's Road Team, a select group of 13 professional drivers who present a message of highway safety to the public. Among its prestigious members are two ABF drivers: Ruben Armendariz and Garland Woods. In addition, ABF's Otto Schmeckenbecher was named as the alternate. "We are very proud of these three ABF drivers, who have been recognized for significant achievements in highway safety, professionalism and customer responsiveness," said Mr. Young. "We are also pleased that the significant accomplishments of these gentlemen are repeated daily by thousands of employees across ABF's North American system." CLIPPER Clipper's first quarter 2003 revenue was $28.5 million versus $25.9 million during the first quarter of 2002, an increase of 10.1%. Clipper's first quarter 2003 operating ratio was 101.7% compared to a 2002 first quarter operating ratio of 102.9%. "In a poor economic environment, Clipper was able to significantly increase its revenue base while reducing its first quarter operating loss. Clipper has been working to improve its revenue mix by eliminating unprofitable accounts and by raising prices on its existing business when appropriate. Clipper's direct cost controls have also improved," said Mr. Young. "When the economy improves, the steps Clipper continues taking to better manage both its revenues and costs should positively affect its bottom line." SALE OF WINGFOOT INTEREST On March 19, Arkansas Best Corporation announced that it had notified Goodyear of its intention to sell its 19% ownership interest in Wingfoot to Goodyear for a cash price of $71.3 million. Arkansas Best anticipates closing the transaction and receiving the proceeds from Goodyear on April 28, 2003. Upon the closing of the transaction, Arkansas Best expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $12 million ($8.4 million after tax, or $0.33 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003. Arkansas Best expects to use the proceeds to reduce the outstanding debt under its credit agreement, which was $85.0 million at March 31, 2003. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE During the first quarter of 2003, Arkansas Best made open market purchases, totaling 100,000 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $2.3 million. This was a part of Arkansas Best's previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS; ABF(R)'S OPERATING INCOME INCREASES 17% (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 18, 2003) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2003 net income of $15.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share. For the second quarter of 2002, net income was $6.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share. This year's second quarter net income includes a $12.1 million pre-tax gain ($8.4 million after-tax, or $0.33 per diluted common share) on the sale of its 19% interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC and a $1.2 million charge ($0.03 per diluted common share) related to the company's interest rate swap. Arkansas Best's revenue, during the second quarter of 2003, was $377.9 million. ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC.(R) ABF Freight System, the company's largest subsidiary, had second quarter 2003 revenues of $337.2 million, a per-day increase of 9.4% compared to second quarter 2002 revenue of $308.1 million. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, including fuel surcharge, was $23.49, an increase of 7.6% over last year's second quarter figure of $21.83. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $22.71, an increase of 6.1% over last year's second quarter figure of $21.41. Approximately one-half of the yield increase, net of fuel surcharge, was a result of changes in the profile of additional freight hauled since September 2002. "Despite the lack of meaningful changes in the soft economy, we continue to be encouraged by the pricing environment," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "ABF's increases on contracts and deferred pricing agreements have been favorable by historical standards and the prospects for retention of the July 14 general rate increase are good." ABF's second quarter LTL tonnage per day increased 2.0% compared to the same period last year. This increase is generally what we would expect, given normal, seasonal trends from
the first quarter to the second quarter. "ABF remains focused on individual account profitability when evaluating new business opportunities and when reviewing freight being handled for existing customers," said Mr. Young. ABF's second quarter 2003 operating ratio of 95.7% was adversely affected by increased non-union health, pension and other fringe costs. "ABF experienced increases in the severity of large, non-union medical claims compared to last year. Non-union pension costs increased due to lower interest rates and market losses occurring in previous years," said Mr. Young. "The increase in these costs over the second quarter of 2002 added approximately one percentage point to ABF's second quarter 2003 operating ratio." "Productivity measures at ABF were very near levels for the same period last year despite additional shipment handling associated with ABF's transit time improvements and premium services provided at pickup and delivery," said Mr. Young. "These measures did show improvement over the first quarter of this year." "To grow, ABF will continue to emphasize expense control in order to hold down customer costs while providing shippers with value-added services. ABF will continue to develop niche markets that provide compensatory prices and reasonable profit margins," said Mr. Young. "ABF will continue to improve shipment transit times within its traditional markets. For example, ABF has reduced shipment transit times on two-thirds of its lanes during the last few years and further improvements are underway. ABF is actively exploring opportunities to be more effective in shorter-haul lanes by utilizing provisions in the new labor contract for flexible, premium service employees. "Last week, Yellow Corporation announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Roadway Corporation. This development will have a significant impact on the long-haul, LTL industry," said Mr. Young. "The combining of these two competitors could, over time, result in opportunities for additional business for ABF and improved pricing due to eventual reductions in industry capacity." CLIPPER For the second quarter of 2003, Clipper had revenues of $33.0 million compared to $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 8.6%. Clipper's second quarter 2003 operating ratio was 97.8% versus 97.3% during the same period last year. "In the second quarter, Clipper experienced increases in its dry freight, full-load business with significant improvements in the revenues and margins of its intermodal division. At Clipper's
temperature-controlled division, revenues and profits were below expectations due to a lack of produce moving off the West Coast and some decline in demand from East Coast consumers," said Mr. Young. "Clipper anticipates that much of the produce normally hauled in the second quarter will be handled in the third quarter this year, as an unusually wet spring caused many crops to be replanted." COMMON STOCK PURCHASE During the second quarter of 2003, Arkansas Best made open market purchases, totaling 100,000 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $2.5 million. This was a part of Arkansas Best's previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. In total, as a part of Arkansas Best's stock repurchase program, the company has purchased 200,000 shares, totaling $4.8 million, during 2003. PENSION STATUS Arkansas Best Corporation has revised its 2003 pension expense estimate to $11.1 million, including $9.6 million for ABF. This compares to its previous pension expense estimate of $10.0 million. At the end of 2002, Arkansas Best's pension plan assets were $127.4 million, which exceeded plan accumulated benefit obligations by $6.8 million. During the second quarter of 2003, Arkansas Best made $15.0 million of tax-deductible contributions, further improving the plan's funded status. CREDIT RATINGS IMPROVEMENT On May 28, Standard & Poor's upgraded Arkansas Best's corporate credit rating to BBB+ from BBB. The upgrade represents a rise to a higher investment grade rating. In its press release announcing these changes, Standard & Poor's stated that the rating upgrade was driven by "the company's strong operating results and decreasing debt levels, which support solid credit measures, despite the continued weak economic environment." RUSSELL 2000(R) INDEX On July 9, the Frank Russell Company announced that for the fourth year in a row, Arkansas Best will be included in the Russell 2000(R) Index. This index measures the performance of the smallest 2,000 securities included in the Russell 3000(R) Index, which measures the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies based on total market
capitalization. As described by the Frank Russell Company, the Russell 2000(R) Index is America's best-known benchmark of small-stock performance.

Each Revolving Borrowing shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing given, not later than (i) 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the third Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Advance or (ii) 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the Business Day of the proposed Borrowing, in the case of a Base Rate Advance, by the Borrower requesting such Revolving Borrowing to the Agent, and on the day of its receipt of a timely Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall transmit a copy of such notice to each Bank by telecopier; provided, however, that the Agent and each of the Banks hereby waive the requirement in clause (i) of this Section 2.2(a) that any Borrower provide three Business Days advance written notice of the date of the initial Borrowing. Each Swingline Advance shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing given by the applicable Borrower to each of the Agent and Wells Fargo not later than 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day of the proposed Borrowing. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be in writing or by telecopier specifying the requested (A) date of such Borrowing, (B) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (C) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (D) if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Interest Period for each such Advance. In the case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.6(b). Each Bank shall (1) in the case of all Revolving Borrowings other than Borrowings made on the same day as the day the Notice of Borrowing is received, before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the date of such Borrowing and (2) in the case of Revolving Borrowings made on the same day as the date of the Notice of Borrowing or Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time), make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.2, 24
or such other location as the Agent may specify by notice to the Banks, in same day funds, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and, except in the case of Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower requesting such funds or, in the case of Mandatory Revolving Borrowings, to Wells Fargo, in each case at such Borrower's or Wells Fargo's (as applicable) account designated in its respective written notice to the Agent. (b) Conversions and Continuations. In order to elect to Convert or continue Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Borrowing under this Section, the Borrower making such election shall deliver an irrevocable Notice of Conversion or Continuation to the Agent at the Agent's office no later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) (i) on the Business Day of the proposed conversion date in the case of a Conversion of such Advances to Base Rate Advances and (ii) at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed Conversion or continuation date in the case of a Conversion to, or a continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each such Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be in writing or by telecopier, specifying (A) the requested Conversion or continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (B) the Borrowing amount and Type of the Advances to be Converted or continued, (C) whether a Conversion or continuation is requested and, if a Conversion, into what Type of Advances, and (D) in the case of a Conversion to, or a Continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Advances, the requested Interest Period. Revolving Advances may only be Converted or continued as Revolving Advances. Swingline Advances may not be Converted or continued. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation under this Section 2.2(b), the Agent shall provide each Bank with a copy thereof and, in the case of a Conversion to or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Advances, notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.6(b). For purposes other than the conditions set forth in Section 3.2, the portion of Revolving Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Borrowing that are Converted to Revolving Advances of another Type shall constitute a new Revolving Borrowing. (c) Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) above: (i) each Borrowing (other than a Borrowing of Swingline Advances) shall be in an aggregate amount not less than (A) $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $500,000, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or (B) $500,000 or greater multiples of $100,000, in the case of Base Rate Advances, and shall consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by the Banks ratably according to their respective Commitments; (ii) at no time shall there be more than five Interest Periods applicable to outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances; (iii) no Borrower may select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing to be made if (A) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or (B) a Default has occurred and is continuing; 25
(iv) no Borrower may select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing to be Converted or continued if (A) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (v) (A) if any Bank shall, at any time prior to the making of any requested Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Advance of such Bank, but otherwise shall be considered part of the same Borrowing and interest on such Base Rate Advance shall be due and payable at the same time that interest on the Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising the remainder of such Borrowing shall be due and payable; and (B) such Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this clause (v) and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank; (vi) if the Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any requested Borrowing, the right of such Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify such Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance; (vii) if the Majority Banks shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Borrowing, notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks of making or funding their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be, for such Borrowing, the right of such Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify such Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance; and (viii) if any Borrower shall fail to select the duration or continuation of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1 and Section 2.2(a) or 2.2(b) above, the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Banks and such Advances will be made available to such Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as Base Rate Advances or, if an existing Advance, Converted into Base Rate Advances. 26
(d) Notices Irrevocable. Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrowers shall indemnify each Bank against any loss or out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any condition precedent for Borrowing set forth in Article III not being satisfied or waived by the Agent and the Majority Banks for any reason, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund the Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (e) Agent Reliance. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank before the date of any Revolving Borrowing or Mandatory Revolving Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrowers severally agree to immediately repay to the Agent on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount is made available to any Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable on such day to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate for such day. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount and interest as provided above, such corresponding amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement even though not made on the same day as the other Advances comprising such Borrowing. (f) Bank Obligations Several. The failure of any Bank to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing. No Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Advance to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing. (g) Notes. The indebtedness of the Borrowers to each Bank resulting from Revolving Advances owing to such Bank shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note of the Borrowers payable to the order of such Bank in substantially the form of Exhibit H, appropriately completed. The indebtedness of the Borrowers to Wells Fargo resulting from Swingline Advances owing to Wells Fargo shall be evidenced by the Swingline Note of the Borrowers payable to the order of Wells Fargo in substantially the form of Exhibit I, appropriately completed. 27
Section 2.3 Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Banks, a facility fee on the average daily aggregate amount of the Commitments, irrespective of the Borrowers' usage of such Commitments, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for the period from the Effective Date until the Maturity Date, which fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Banks, a fee in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin calculated on the average daily maximum amount available from time to time to be drawn under such outstanding Letters of Credit, which fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date. In addition to the fees referred to in the preceding sentence, the Borrowers agree to pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account amendment, transfer and negotiation fees, in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding and issued by such Issuing Bank, which fees shall be due and payable in such amounts, at such times and otherwise in accordance with such Issuing Bank's then current policy. (c) Agent Fees. The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent and/or Wells Fargo, for its benefit, the fees set forth in the Agent's Fee Letter. Section 2.4 Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Voluntary Reduction. The Borrowers shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the Commitments; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $1,000,000. Subject to Section 2.17, any termination or reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be permanent, with no obligation of the Banks to reinstate such Commitments and the facility fees provided for in Section 2.3(a) shall thereafter be computed on the basis of the Commitments, as so reduced. (b) Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) a change in control is reported by the Company in response to either Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of voting Capital Stock of the Company (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such Capital Stock) representing the Control Percentage or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Capital Stock, 28
then, in such event the Majority Banks may, at their sole option upon written notice to the Company (a "Termination Notice"), declare the obligation of each Bank to make Advances and the obligation of each Issuing Bank to issue, increase or extend Letters of Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate and the Commitments shall reduce to zero. Section 2.5 Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Advances. The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each Revolving Advance on the Maturity Date. (b) Swingline Advances. The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Advance on the earlier of the Maturity Date or the date which is three Business Days after the date such Swingline Advance was made. Section 2.6 Interest. The Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: (a) Base Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times, to the lesser of (i) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Maximum Rate, payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the date such Base Rate Advance is payable in full, provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (A) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount becomes due plus two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate. (b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance, to the lesser of (i) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Maximum Rate, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance is payable in full; provided, however, in the case of an Interest Period greater than three months, accrued interest shall also be payable on the date that is three months after the first day of such Interest Period; and provided, further, that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (A) the greater of (1) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus two percent (2%) and (2) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due plus two percent (2%) and (b) the Maximum Rate. (c) Swingline Advances. If such Advance is a Swingline Advance, a rate per annum equal, at all times, to the lesser of (i) the rate agreed to pursuant to the letter 29
agreement between the Company and Wells Fargo dated May 15, 2002 and (ii) the Maximum Rate, payable in arrears on the earlier of the Maturity Date of this Agreement or the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and, if a Default has then occurred and is continuing, on the date such Swingline Advance is payable in full, provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (1) the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount becomes due plus two percent (2%) and (2) the Maximum Rate. (d) Usury Recapture. In the event that, but for limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, the rate of interest otherwise chargeable under this Agreement at any time is greater than the Maximum Rate, then the unpaid principal amount of the Advances shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the Advances equals the amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued on the Advances if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had at all times been in effect. In the event, upon payment in full of the Advances, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement on the Advances is less than the total amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had, at all times, been in effect, then the Borrowers shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Agent for the account of the Banks an amount equal to the difference between (i) the lesser of (A) the amount of interest which would have been charged on the Advances if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect and (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the Advances if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to limitations regarding the Maximum Rate set forth in this Agreement, had at all times been in effect and (ii) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement on the Advances. In the event the Banks ever receive, collect or apply as interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Advances, and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Borrowers. (e) Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) at all times during which an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, interest shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding principal amount of each Advance, and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, interest shall accrue on any other amount of the Obligations which is not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), in each case payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate, which interest at such rate shall accrue from the initial date of the giving of notice by the Agent to the Company of the occurrence of such Event of Default (as to clause (i) 30
preceding) or from the date such amount of the Obligations became due until the date such amount is paid in full (as to clause (ii) preceding). Section 2.7 Prepayments. (a) Right to Prepay. The Borrowers shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Advance except as provided in this Section 2.7. (b) Optional Prepayments. The Borrowers may elect to prepay any of the Advances, after giving notice thereof to the Agent (i) by 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day of prepayment of any Swingline Advance, and (ii) by 11:00 a.m. (Dallas Texas time) at least three Business Days' prior to the day of prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advances and at least one Business Day prior to the day of prepayment of any Base Rate Advances. Such notice must state the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of such prepayment, whether such prepayment should be applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances or Swingline Advances, and if applicable, the relevant Interest Period for the Advances to be prepaid. If any such notice is given, the Borrowers shall prepay Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount specified in such notice, and shall also pay accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date; provided, however, that each partial prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or greater multiples of $500,000. (c) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) Change of Control. On the fifth Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Termination Notice pursuant to Section 2.4(b) hereof, the Borrowers shall be required to prepay all outstanding Advances and all other unpaid Obligations in full and to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure. (ii) Borrowing Base Deficiency. On each Borrowing Base Determination Date, the Borrowers shall be required to prepay the Advances in an aggregate amount equal to the positive remainder, if any, of (A) the aggregate amount of all outstanding Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure on such date minus (B) the Borrowing Base, as determined on such Borrowing Base Determination Date (or, upon payment in full of all outstanding Advances, to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the amount by which the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base). (iii) Reduction of Commitments. In the event the Commitments are reduced in accordance with Section 2.4(a), the Borrowers shall prepay the Advances to the extent the aggregate amount of all outstanding Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments after giving effect to such reduction (or, upon payment in full of all outstanding 31
Advances, to deposit with the Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the amount by which the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the Commitments as so reduced). (iv) Accrued Interest. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date. (v) Avoidance of Breakage Costs. In the event that the amount of any mandatory prepayment of Advances under this Section 2.7(c) exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Advances which consist of Base Rate Advances (the amount of such excess being the "Excess Amount"), the Borrowers shall have the right, in lieu of making such prepayment in full, to prepay such outstanding Advances which are Base Rate Advances and to deposit an amount equal to the Excess Amount with the Agent in the Cash Collateral Account maintained by and in the sole dominion and control of the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks. Any amount so deposited shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the Obligations and applied to the prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Advances at the end of the current Interest Period(s) applicable thereto. On any day on which amounts collected in the Cash Collateral Account remain on deposit in or to the credit of the Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to the payment made on such day pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), and the Company shall have delivered to the Agent a written request or a telephonic request (which shall be promptly confirmed in writing) prior to 10:00 am (Dallas, Texas time) that such remaining collected amounts be invested in cash equivalents specified in such request, the Agent shall invest such funds, to the extent the Agent is reasonably able to do so, in such cash equivalents as are acceptable to, and with no risk to, the Agent on an overnight basis or with maturities such that amounts will be available to pay the Obligations secured thereby as they become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise; provided, however, that any loss resulting from such investments shall be charged to and be immediately payable by the Borrowers on demand by the Agent. (d) Ratable Payments. Each payment of any Advance pursuant to this Section 2.7 or any other provision of this Agreement shall be made in a manner such that all Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing are paid in whole or ratably in part. (e) Effect of Notice. All notices given pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Borrowers. Section 2.8 Breakage Costs. If (a) any payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance as a result of any payment pursuant to Section 2.7 or the acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Article VII or otherwise, (b) any Conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance pursuant to Section 2.12 or otherwise, or (c) the Borrowers fail to make a principal or interest payment with respect to any Eurodollar Rate 32
Advance on the date such payment is due and payable, the Borrowers shall, within 10 days of any written demand sent by any Bank to the Company through the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of breakage costs) required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses or out-of-pocket costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or nonpayment, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or maintain such Advance. Section 2.9 Increased Costs. (a) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If, after the date hereof, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrowers shall from time to time, within 30 days of written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of increased costs) sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost; provided, however, that, before making any such demand, each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. In determining such increased costs, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(a) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(a), shall submit to the Company and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such increased cost, (B) detailing the calculation of such cost, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(a) for any increased costs. (b) Capital Adequacy. If any Bank or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) implemented or effective after the date of this Agreement affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or such Issuing Bank and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend or such Issuing Bank's commitment to issue Letters of 33
Credit or any Bank's commitment to risk participate in Letters of Credit and other commitments of this type, then, upon 30 days prior written notice by such Bank or such Issuing Bank (with a copy of any such demand to the Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank or to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by such Bank or such Issuing Bank, additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable in respect of increased costs) sufficient to compensate such Bank or such Issuing Bank, in light of such circumstances, (i) with respect to such Bank, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend under this Agreement or its commitment to risk participate in Letters of Credit and (ii) with respect to such Issuing Bank, to the extent that such Issuing Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit. In determining such additional amounts, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(b) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(b), shall submit to the Company and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such additional amounts, (B) detailing the calculation of such additional amounts, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such additional amounts to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) for any additional amounts. (c) Letters of Credit. If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, any Issuing Bank or any Bank or (ii) impose on such Issuing Bank or any Bank any other condition regarding the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letters of Credit or any Letter of Credit Obligations, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to such Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit, or increase the cost to such Bank of its risk participation in any Letter of Credit (which increase in cost shall be determined by such Issuing Bank's or such Bank's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such event), then, within 30 days of written demand by such Issuing Bank or such Bank (with a copy sent to the Agent), as the case may be, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by such Issuing Bank or such Bank, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Bank for such increased cost. Each Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the booking of its Letters of Credit or risk participations if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this Section 2.9(c) and would 34
not, in the reasonable judgment of such Issuing Bank or such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be. In determining such increased costs, each Bank will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's reasonable good faith determination (made in a manner generally consistent with the Bank's standard practices) of compensation owing under this Section 2.9(c) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Each Bank, at the time such Bank demands payment under this Section 2.9(c), shall submit to the Company and the Agent a certificate (A) as to the amount of such increased cost, (B) detailing the calculation of such cost, and (C) certifying that such Bank is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities; provided that, unless such Bank is also demanding compensation generally from other similarly situated borrowers of such Bank under similar credit facilities, the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate such Bank pursuant to this Section 2.9(c) for any increased costs. Section 2.10 Payments and Computations. (a) Payment Procedures. Except if otherwise set forth herein, the Borrowers shall make each payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the location referred to in the Notes (or such other location as the Agent shall designate in writing to the Company) in same day funds without set-off, counterclaims or other deduction. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable solely to the Agent, the Issuing Banks or a specific Bank pursuant to Section 2.1(b), 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.6(c), 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 2.12 or 2.13(c) but after taking into account payments effected pursuant to Section 9.4) to the Banks in accordance with each Bank's Pro Rata Share for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank or any Issuing Bank to such Bank or such Issuing Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Computations. All computations of interest or fees based on the Base Rate, the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Non-Business Day Payments. Whenever any payment shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 35
(d) Agent Reliance. Unless the Agent shall have received written notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrowers shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for such day. (e) Application of Payments. Unless otherwise specified in Section 2.7 hereof, whenever any payment received by the Agent under this Agreement is insufficient to pay in full all amounts then due and payable under this Agreement and the Notes, such payment shall be distributed and applied by the Agent and the Banks in the following order: first, to the payment of fees and expenses due and payable to the Agent or Wells Fargo under and in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document; second, to the payment of all expenses due and payable under Section 2.11(c), ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate amount of such payments owed to each such Bank; third, to the payment of fees due and payable to the Issuing Banks pursuant to Section 2.3(b); fourth, to the payment of all other fees due and payable under Section 2.3 ratably among the Banks in accordance with their applicable Commitments; and fifth, to the payment of the interest accrued on and the principal amount of all of the Advances, Reimbursement Obligations and other Obligations, regardless of whether any such amount is then due and payable, ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate accrued interest plus the aggregate principal amount owed to such Bank. Section 2.11 Taxes. (a) No Deduction for Certain Taxes. Any and all payments by the Borrowers shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.10, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank, each Issuing Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision of such jurisdiction (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes") and, in the case of each Bank and each Issuing Bank, Taxes by the jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision of such jurisdiction. If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.11), such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; provided, however, that if such Borrower's obligation 36
to deduct or withhold Taxes is caused solely by such Bank's, such Issuing Bank's or the Agent's failure to provide the forms described in Section 2.11(e) and such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent could have provided such forms, no such increase shall be required; (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions; and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Notes, or the other Credit Documents (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) Indemnification. In addition, the Borrowers agree to indemnify each Bank, each Issuing Bank and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.11) paid by such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Each payment required to be made by the Borrowers in respect of this indemnification shall be made by the Borrowers in respect of this indemnification shall be made to the Agent for the benefit of any party claiming such indemnification within 30 days from the date the Company receives written demand detailing the calculation of such amounts therefor from the Agent on behalf of such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent. If any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Agent receives a refund in respect of any taxes paid by the Borrowers under this Section 2.11(c), such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the Borrowers such refund. (d) Evidence of Tax Payments. The Borrowers will pay prior to delinquency all Taxes payable in respect of any payment. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Company will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.2, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment of such Taxes. (e) Foreign Bank Withholding Exemption. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or a state thereof (a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees that it will deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent on the date of this Agreement or upon the effectiveness of any Assignment and Acceptance (i) two duly completed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto, appropriately completed, and a Form W-8BEN, or other equivalent successor form, as appropriate, certifying in each case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes and (ii) any other governmental forms which are necessary or required under an applicable 37
tax treaty or otherwise by law to reduce or eliminate any withholding tax, which have been reasonably requested by any Borrower. Each Bank which delivers to the Borrowers and the Agent a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or other equivalent successor form, as appropriate, further undertakes to deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent two further copies of such form, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrowers and the Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by any Borrower and the Agent certifying in the case of a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes. If an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any delivery required by the preceding sentence would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent any Bank from duly completing and delivering any such letter or form with respect to it and such Bank advises such Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of U.S. federal income tax, such Bank shall not be required to deliver such forms. The Borrowers shall withhold tax at the rate and in the manner required by the laws of the U.S. with respect to payments made to a Bank failing to timely provide the requisite Internal Revenue Service forms. Section 2.12 Illegality. If any Bank shall notify the Agent and the Company that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank then outstanding hereunder, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall, if demanded by such Bank in its notice, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time), (a) if not prohibited by law or regulation to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the last day of the Interest Period for each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Bank or (b) if prohibited by law or regulation to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the second Business Day following its receipt of such notice from such Bank, Convert all Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank then outstanding to Base Rate Advances and pay accrued interest on the principal amount Converted to the date of such Conversion and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such Conversion being made on such date. Each Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this Section 2.12 and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 2.13 Letters of Credit. (a) Issuance. From time to time from the date of this Agreement until three months before the Maturity Date, at the request of any Borrower, each Issuing Bank shall, on any Business Day and on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, issue, increase, decrease, amend or extend the expiration date of Letters of Credit for the 38
account of the Borrowers (for the benefit of a Borrower or for the benefit of any of the other Subsidiaries of the Company). No Letter of Credit will be issued, increased or extended (i) if such issuance, increase or extension would cause the Letter of Credit Exposure to exceed the lesser of (a) $125,000,000 or (b) an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the aggregate Commitments minus (2) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Advances and Swingline Advances at such time; (ii) unless such Letter of Credit has an Expiration Date not later than the earlier of (A) one year after the date of issuance thereof or (B) five days before the Maturity Date; (iii) unless such Letter of Credit is in form and substance acceptable to the respective Issuing Bank in its sole discretion; (iv) unless such Letter of Credit is a standby letter of credit not supporting the repayment of indebtedness for borrowed money of any Person, other than a Letter of Credit issued in substitution of any letter of credit outstanding on the Effective Date and listed on Schedule 1.1(b); (v) unless the Borrower requesting such Letter of Credit has delivered to the respective Issuing Bank a completed and executed letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form, which shall contain terms no more restrictive than the terms of this Agreement; and (vi) unless such Letter of Credit is governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 ("UCP") or any successor to the UCP. If the terms of any letter of credit application referred to in the foregoing clause (v) conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. (b) Participations. With respect to each letter of credit described on Schedule 1.1(b), the Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks agree that such letters of credit shall constitute Letters of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement and each Bank agrees that it has a participation in the related Letter of Credit Exposure equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share on the Effective Date. On the date of the issuance or increase of any Letter of Credit on or after the Effective Date, each Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold to each other Bank and each other Bank shall have been deemed to have purchased from such Issuing Bank a participation in the Letter of Credit Exposure related to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share at such date and such sale and purchase shall otherwise be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each such participant Bank by telex, telephone or telecopy of each Letter of Credit of such Issuing Bank issued, increased or decreased, and the actual dollar amount of such Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit. Each Bank's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section 2.13(b) and to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank for such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed in full by the Borrowers shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any of the circumstances described in Section 2.13(d) below, (ii) the occurrence and continuance of a Default, (iii) an adverse change in the financial condition of any Borrower or Guarantor, or (iv) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, except for any such circumstance, happening or event constituting or arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank. 39
(c) Reimbursement. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay on demand to each Issuing Bank in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank an amount equal to any amount paid by such Issuing Bank under or in respect of such Letter of Credit. In the event any Issuing Bank makes a payment pursuant to a request for draw presented under a Letter of Credit and such payment is not promptly reimbursed by the Borrowers upon demand, such Issuing Bank shall give notice of such payment to the Agent and the Banks, and each Bank shall promptly reimburse such Issuing Bank for such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such payment, and such reimbursement shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to constitute a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower from such Bank. If such reimbursement is not made by any Bank to any Issuing Bank on the same day on which such Issuing Bank shall have made payment on any such draw, such Bank shall pay interest thereon to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Borrowers hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorize, empower and direct the Agent and the Banks to record and otherwise treat each payment under a Letter of Credit not immediately reimbursed by the Borrowers as a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances to the Borrowers. (d) Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, notwithstanding the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit Documents; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Letter of Credit Documents; (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which any Borrower or any Bank or any other Person may have at any time against any beneficiary or transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the respective Issuing Bank or any other Person or entity, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or in any Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect to the extent the respective Issuing Bank would not be liable therefor pursuant to the following Section 2.13(e); (v) payment by the respective Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or 40
(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 2.13(d) shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any remedies of any Borrower in connection with the Letters of Credit. (e) Liability of Issuing Banks. The Borrowers assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. No Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (i) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the relevant Letter of Credit; or (iv) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit (including such Issuing Bank's own negligence), except that the Borrowers shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to, and shall promptly pay to, the Borrowers, to the extent of any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages suffered by the Borrowers which the Borrowers prove were caused by (A) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (B) such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificate strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, any Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. Section 2.14 Determination of Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base shall be determined by the Agent, as follows: (a) Monthly. On the 25th day of each calendar month the Agent shall determine the Borrowing Base upon receipt of a Borrowing Base Certificate dated as of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month. (b) Property Adjustments. Following (i) any sale by any Borrower or Guarantor of any Property included in the Borrowing Base with a sales value in excess of 41
$25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end, (ii) any loss or casualty not covered by insurance resulting in destruction of any Property included in the Borrowing Base if the loss or casualty exceeds $25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end, or (iii) any permitted purchase by any Borrower or Guarantor of any Property which can be included in the Borrowing Base with a purchase price in excess of $25,000,000 individually or in the aggregate since the most recent month end (each of such events hereinafter called an "Adjustment Event"), the Company shall (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above) or may (in the case of clause (iii) above) give the Agent notice of such Adjustment Event within five Business Days of the closing of such Adjustment Event, and the Agent may in its sole reasonable discretion (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above) or shall (in the case of clause (iii) above) further adjust the appropriate Borrowing Base components set forth in the most recent month end Borrowing Base Certificate delivered by the Company to the Banks to reflect the Adjustment Events occurring since the date of such Borrowing Base Certificate. (c) Notice of Borrowing Base Change. Promptly following any date the Borrowing Base is redetermined in accordance with this Section 2.14, the Agent shall give notice to the Banks and the Company of the new Borrowing Base. Section 2.15 Bank Replacement. (a) Right to Replace. The Company shall have the right to replace each Bank affected by a condition under clause (v) of Section 2.2(c), Section 2.9 or Section 2.12 for more than 90 days or each Bank which fails to consent to any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.18 (each such Bank, an "Affected Bank") in accordance with the procedures in this Section 2.15 and provided that no reduction of the total Commitments occurs as a result thereof. (b) First Right of Refusal; Replacement. (i) Upon the occurrence of any condition permitting the replacement of a Bank, each Bank which is not an Affected Bank shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to increase its respective Commitment by an amount not to exceed the amount of the Commitments of the Affected Banks, which election shall be made by written notice from each such Bank to the Agent and the Company given within 30 days after the date such condition occurs specifying the amount of such proposed increase in such Bank's Commitment. (ii) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election is in excess of the Commitments of the Affected Banks, (A) the Commitments of the Affected Banks shall be allocated pro rata among such Banks based on the respective amounts of the proposed increases to Commitments elected by each of such Banks, and (B) the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts as so allocated so that, after giving effect to such termination and increases, the 42
aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks will be the same as prior to such termination. (iii) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election equals the Commitments of the Affected Banks, the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts of their proposed increases so that, after giving effect to such termination and increases, the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks will be the same as prior to such termination. (iv) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increases in Commitments of all such Banks making such an election is less than the Commitments of the Affected Banks, (A) the respective Commitments of such Banks shall be increased by the respective amounts of their proposed increases, and (B) the Company shall add additional Banks which are Eligible Assignees to this Agreement to replace such Affected Banks, which additional Banks would have aggregate Commitments no greater than those of the Affected Banks minus the amounts thereof assumed by the other Banks pursuant to such increases. (c) Procedure. Any assumptions of Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be made by the purchasing Bank or Eligible Assignee and the selling Bank entering into an Assignment and Assumption and by following the procedures in Section 9.6 for adding a Bank. In connection with the increase of the Commitments of any Bank pursuant to the foregoing Section 2.15(b), each Bank with an increased Commitment shall purchase from the Affected Banks at par such Bank's ratable share of the outstanding Advances of the Affected Banks and assume such Bank's ratable share of the Affected Banks' Letter of Credit Exposure. Section 2.16 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) on account of its Advances or its share of Letter of Credit Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments on account of the Advances or Letter of Credit Obligations obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall notify the Agent and forthwith purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Advances made by them or Letter of Credit Obligations held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be rescinded and such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of the participation sold by such Bank to the purchasing Bank as a result of such excess payment to (b) the total amount of such excess payment) of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Bank's required repayment to the purchasing Bank to (ii) the total amount of all such required repayments to the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless and until rescinded as provided above, exercise all its rights of payment (including 43
the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. Section 2.17 Increase of Commitments. By delivery of an effective Increase Notice to the Agent (which the Agent shall promptly distribute to the Banks), the Company may request an increase of the aggregate amount of the Commitments; provided that (a) the aggregate amount of the Commitments both before and after giving effect to such requested increase shall not exceed $275,000,000, (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom and (c) the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Agent a commitment (or commitments) from (i) at least one Bank that commits to lending to the Borrowers more than its then current Commitment (such Bank to be referred to herein as an "Existing Bank" and such amount of its commitment above its then current Commitment to be referred to herein as a "Commitment Supplement") and/or (ii) any other Person (including an Affiliate of a Bank) that meets the requirements (other than the approval requirement) of clause (a) or (b) of the definition of "Eligible Assignee" (as defined in Article I hereof) and that commits to lending to the Borrowers and becoming a Bank under this Agreement (such Person to be referred to herein as a "New Bank" and the amount of its commitment to be referred to herein as a "New Commitment") (each Existing Bank and each New Bank to be referred to herein collectively as the "Supplementing Banks"). Upon receipt of notice from the Agent to the Banks and the Company that the Supplementing Banks have agreed to commit to increase the Commitments by an aggregate amount equal to the Increase Amount (as defined below) and execution and delivery by the Borrowers, the Agent and the Supplementing Banks of an Increased Commitment Agreement evidencing such agreement, then (A) the then current aggregate Commitments shall be increased by the Increase Amount, (B) the then current Commitment of each Existing Bank shall be increased by such Existing Bank's Commitment Supplement and (C) each of the New Banks will be added as a Bank under this Agreement and each such New Bank's Commitment shall be such New Bank's New Commitment. On the effective date of the Increased Commitment Agreement, the Borrowers shall request a Revolving Advance hereunder, which Revolving Advance shall be made by (and only by) the Supplementing Banks in the appropriate amounts as provided below. The proceeds of such Revolving Advance shall be utilized by the Borrowers to repay the Banks that did not agree to increase their Commitments, such Revolving Advance and repayment to be in amounts sufficient so that, after giving effect to the Increased Commitment Agreement, the Revolving Advances and the Letter of Credit Exposure shall be held by the Banks according to their Pro Rata Share of the Commitments as increased in accordance with the Increased Commitment Agreement. Section 2.18 Extensions of the Maturity Date. In the manner set forth in this Section 2.18, the Company may request that the Maturity Date may be extended (i) up to two times, in each case, for a period of one year measured from the Maturity Date then in effect or (ii) once for a period no longer than two years measured from the Maturity Date in effect as of the Effective Date. If the Company wishes to request such an extension of the Maturity Date, it shall give written notice to that effect to the Agent not less than 60 days prior to the date that is one year prior to the Maturity Date then in effect. If the Agent approves of the requested extension of the Maturity Date, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of receipt of such request and of the new requested Maturity Date. Each Bank shall endeavor to respond to such request, whether affirmatively or negatively (such determination in the sole discretion of such Bank), by notice to the Company and the Agent within 21 days of receipt of such request. If (but 44
only if) all Banks approve of the requested extension of the Maturity Date, the Maturity Date for all purposes of this Agreement shall be the extended Maturity Date specified in the notice from the Agent to the Banks that was approved by all Banks, and the Agent shall give written notice of such extended Maturity Date to the Company, the Issuing Bank and the Banks. Section 2.19 Agreements regarding Subsidiaries. (a) Domestic Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it shall cause each Domestic Subsidiary that is not a Borrower to guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations pursuant to the Guaranty to be executed by such Subsidiary prior to or substantially concurrent with the Borrower's execution of this Agreement. Contemporaneously with the creation or acquisition of any Domestic Subsidiary after the Closing Date that does not become a Borrower, the Company shall (i) cause such Domestic Subsidiary to guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations by executing and delivering to the Agent an Accession Agreement, (ii) deliver a certificate covering the same matters described in clause (iii) of Section 3.1(a) with respect to such Domestic Subsidiary and (iii) deliver an opinion of Borrowers' counsel with respect thereto covering the matters previously opined on with regard to each Guarantor. The Company agrees that it shall cause each Domestic Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or does not become a Guarantor pursuant to this Section 2.19(a) to become a Borrower pursuant to a Borrower Joinder. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the Borrower Joinder, the Company shall (i) cause such Domestic Subsidiary to deliver a certificate covering the same matters described in clause (iii) of Section 3.1(a) with respect to such Domestic Subsidiary, (ii) deliver an opinion of Company's counsel with respect thereto covering the matters previously opined on with regard to each Borrower and (iii) cause such Domestic Subsidiary and the other Borrowers to execute replacement Revolving Note and Swing Line Note. (b) Foreign Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary that owns any Capital Stock of a Foreign Subsidiary to (the extent not restricted by law), pledge two-thirds of all issued and outstanding shares of each class of Capital Stock of each Foreign Subsidiary (or, in the event that the Company and its Subsidiaries own, in the aggregate, less than two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of such Capital Stock, all of such issued and outstanding shares owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries) to the Agent as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, each of which pledges shall be pursuant to a pledge and security agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (the "Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements"); provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pledge the Capital Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, contribute less than 12.5% of the EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined as of the most recent Calculation Day based on the Calculation Period then ended; provided, further, however, that if, for any subsequent Calculation Period, EBITDA of the Foreign Stock Subsidiaries whose Capital Stock is not pledged pursuant to this Section 2.19(b) equals 12.5% or more of the EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall promptly (and in any event within ten Business Days after such determination is initially made) execute additional Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements 45
which pledge the Capital Stock of additional Foreign Subsidiaries such that the EBITDA of the Foreign Stock Subsidiaries whose Capital Stock is not pledged is less than 12.5% of the EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Each of such pledges shall constitute a perfected, first priority Lien in all such Capital Stock of each Foreign Subsidiary. In addition to the foregoing and in connection with the Foreign Stock Pledge Agreements, the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries shall deliver to the Agent the original certificates evidencing all of the Capital Stock so pledged, together with stock powers appropriately executed in blank or other instruments of transfer in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent.

For purposes of determining the Company's compliance with this Section 6.12, an amount equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the aggregate amount of cash then previously paid after December 31, 2002 to such Calculation Day to its shareholders for repurchases, redemptions or other reacquisitions of its Capital Stock permitted in accordance with Section 6.5(c) and (ii) 75% of the amount of cash then previously paid in respect of the One-Time Dividend permitted in accordance with Section 6.5(c), in each case which payments have reduced the Company's Consolidated Net Worth by the amount of such payments, shall be added as an adjustment to the Company's Consolidated Net Worth. For purposes of this Section 6.12, the following terms shall have the following meanings: "Cumulative Net Income" means the cumulative Consolidated Net Income of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period from January 1, 2003 through the applicable Calculation Day (the "subject period"), exclusive of (i) any Net Losses (as defined below) during any completed fiscal quarter of such subject period and (ii) positive Consolidated Net Income of the Company and its Subsidiaries during any completed fiscal quarter during the Recovery Period not to exceed, in the aggregate, the aggregate amount of the Net Losses excluded pursuant to clause (i) preceding.

"Recovery Period" means, with respect to each fiscal quarter during the subject period in which there were Net Losses, the period up to four consecutive fiscal quarters which occur during the subject period and which immediately succeed the fiscal quarter during which such Net Losses occurred. In the case that there have been two or more 63

For purposes of calculating "Capital Expenditures" pursuant to this Section 6.14, all Acquisition Expenditures permitted pursuant to Section 6.16 shall be excluded. Section 6.15 Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, if the Company's Senior Debt is not rated either BBB- or higher by either S&P or Fitch or Baa3 or higher by Moody's, then the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any Additional Permitted Indebtedness without the prior written consent of the Majority Banks; and 65
(e) extensions, renewals and refinancings of any of the Indebtedness specified in Sections 6.15(a), 6.15(b), 6.15(c) and/or 6.15(d) so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness is not thereby increased.

The Borrowers hereby pledge, and grant to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks a Lien and security interest in, all funds held in the Cash Collateral Account from time to time and all proceeds thereof, as security for the payment of the Obligations, including without limitation all Letter of Credit Obligations owing to any Issuing Bank or any other Bank due and to become due from the Borrowers to any Issuing Bank or any other Bank under this Agreement in connection with the Letters of Credit. (b) Application against Letter of Credit Obligations. The Agent may, at any time or from time to time, apply funds then held in the Cash Collateral Account to the payment of any Letter of Credit Obligations owing to any Issuing Bank, in such order as the Agent may elect, as shall have become or shall become due and payable by the Borrowers to any Issuing Bank under this Agreement in connection with the Letters of Credit. (c) Duty of Care. The Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account and shall be deemed to 69
have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any such funds. Section 7.5 Non-exclusivity of Remedies. No remedy conferred upon the Agent or the Banks is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each remedy shall be cumulative of all other remedies existing by contract, at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

Each Bank agrees to promptly notify the Borrowers after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Credit Document (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Banks, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Banks and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or applicable law. 70

Section 8.3 The Agent and Its Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent. The term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Company or any such Subsidiary, all as if the Agent were not an agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks. Section 8.4 Bank Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.5 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

Section 8.5 Indemnification. The Banks severally agree to indemnify the Agent and each Issuing Bank (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers), according to their respective Pro Rata Shares from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or such Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any other Credit 71
Document (INCLUDING THE AGENT'S OR SUCH ISSUING BANK'S OWN NEGLIGENCE), provided that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's and such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers. Section 8.6 Successor Agent and Issuing Banks. The Agent or any Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Company and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Banks upon receipt of written notice from the Majority Banks to such effect. Upon receipt of notice of any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent or Issuing Bank with, if an Event of Default has not occurred and is not continuing, the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent or Issuing Bank shall have been so appointed, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's or Issuing Bank's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, then the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank may, on behalf of the Banks and the Company, appoint a successor Agent or Issuing Bank, which shall be a commercial bank meeting the financial requirements of an Eligible Assignee and, in the case of an Issuing Bank, a Bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent or Issuing Bank by a successor Agent or Issuing Bank, such successor Agent or Issuing Bank shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, and the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, except that the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain an Issuing Bank with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and outstanding on the effective date of its resignation or removal and the provisions affecting such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit shall inure to the benefit of the retiring Issuing Bank until the termination of all such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Agent's or Issuing Bank's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent or Issuing Bank, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent or Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.4 Costs and Expenses.

The Company shall have ten days from the date of its receipt of notice of the proposed sale of such participation to the Proposed Participant to select replacement banks to replace such Proposed Participant. If the Company does not select any 76
replacement banks or does not elect replacement banks the applicable Bank may sell such participation to the Proposed Participant. Section 9.7 Indemnification. The Borrowers shall indemnify the Agent, the Banks (including any lender which was a Bank hereunder prior to any full assignment of its Commitment), the Issuing Banks and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and discharge, release and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from (a) any actual or proposed use by any Borrower or any Affiliate of any Borrower of the proceeds of any Advance, (b) any breach by any Borrower, any Subsidiary of any Borrower or any Guarantor of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (c) any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (including any threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, or (d) any Environmental Claim or requirement of Environmental Laws concerning or relating to the present or previously-owned or operated properties, or the operations or business, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Borrowers shall reimburse the Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Bank and each affiliate thereof their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand, for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding; and EXPRESSLY INCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE INCURRED BY REASON OF THE PERSON BEING INDEMNIFIED'S OWN NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSES INCURRED BY REASON OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PERSON TO BE INDEMNIFIED. Section 9.8 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Section 9.9 Survival of Representations, Etc. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or made in writing by or on behalf of the Borrowers in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Credit Documents, the making of the Advances and any investigation made by or on behalf of the Banks, none of which investigations shall diminish any Bank's right to rely on such representations and warranties. All obligations of the Borrowers provided for in Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11(c) and 9.7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations. Section 9.10 Severability. In case one or more provisions of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. Section 9.11 Commercial Loans. The Borrowers represent and warrant that the Advances are and shall be "Commercial Loans" as such term is used in Chapter 306 of the Texas Finance Code. In the event that applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 77
of the Texas Finance Code, the ceiling shall be the indicated (weekly) ceiling and shall be used when appropriate in determining the Maximum Rate. Section 9.12 Usury Not Intended. It is the intent of the Borrowers and each Bank in the execution and performance of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury laws, including conflicts of law concepts, governing the Advances of each Bank including such applicable laws of the State of Texas and the U.S. from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Banks and the Borrowers stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate and that for purposes hereof "interest" shall include the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under such laws that are contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement; and in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts taken, reserved, charged, received or paid on the Advances include amounts which, by applicable law, are deemed interest which would exceed the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a mistake and each Bank receiving same shall credit the same on the principal of its Advances (or if such Advances shall have been paid in full, refund said excess to the Borrowers). In the event that the maturity of the Advances is accelerated by reason of any election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include more than the Maximum Rate and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the applicable Advances (or, if the applicable Advances shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrowers). The provisions of this Section 9.12 shall control over all other provisions of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents which may be in apparent conflict herewith. Section 9.13 Governing Law. This Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas. Section 9.14 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Texas state or federal court sitting in Dallas, Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents, and the Borrowers hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court. The Borrowers hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, any right it may have to the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Borrowers hereby agree that service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to the Borrowers at the address specified in Section 9.2. The Borrowers agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 9.14 shall affect the rights of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of the Agent, the Issuing Bank 78
or any Bank to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrowers or their respective Property in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Section 9.15 Banks not in Control. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in the Credit Documents shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Banks the right or power to exercise control over the affairs and/or management of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Guarantor, the power of the Banks being limited to the right to exercise the rights and remedies provided in the Credit Documents; provided, however, that if any Bank becomes the owner of any stock, or other equity interest in, any Person whether through foreclosure or otherwise, such Bank shall be entitled (subject to requirements of law) to exercise such legal rights as it may have by being owner of such stock, or other equity interest in, such Person. Section 9.16 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections, clauses and paragraphs of the Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Section 9.17 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWERs, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. Section 9.18 Binding Arbitration. (a) Arbitration. The Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks agree, upon demand, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise arising out of or relating to in any way (i) this Agreement or the other Credit Documents and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination; or (ii) requests for additional credit. (b) Governing Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in Texas selected by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"); (ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA's commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA's optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to, as applicable, as the "Rules"). If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any Person who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a 79
demand by any other Person shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other Person in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any Person that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar applicable state law. (c) No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any Person to (i) foreclose against real or personal property collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any Person to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 9.18(c). (d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of Texas with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator's discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Texas and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Person, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other Person contests such action for judicial relief. (e) Discovery. In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date and within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for 80
discovery is essential for the such Person's presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available. (f) Class Proceedings and Consolidations. The resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by a separate arbitration proceeding and such dispute shall not be consolidated with other disputes or included in any class proceeding. (g) Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding. (h) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators, the Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other Person that is a party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a Person required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the Credit Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Credit Documents or any relationship between or among the Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks. Section 9.19 Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors who, in the reasonable judgment of the Agent and the applicable Banks, need to know such information for the purpose of performing or exercising the duties, obligations, rights and remedies of the Agent or such Banks under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Credit Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to any agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company, or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent or any Bank on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company. In addition, the Agent and the Banks may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agent and the Banks in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement 81
and the other Credit Documents. For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Company or any other Borrowers or Guarantors relating to the Company or any other Borrowers or Guarantors or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent or any Bank on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or any other Borrowers or Guarantors. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, "Information" shall not include, and the Agent and each Bank may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or such Bank relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Advances, Letters of Credit and transactions contemplated hereby. Section 9.20 Joint and Several Liability. Each Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable to the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks for the performance of all obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents to which they are a party. Notwithstanding anything herein, in the Notes or in any other Credit Document to the contrary, in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if, as a result of applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, including Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, "Fraudulent Transfer Laws"), the obligations of any Borrower other than the Company (a "Non-Company Borrower") under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document would otherwise, after giving effect to (a) all other liabilities of such Non-Company Borrower, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under such Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Non-Company Borrower in respect of intercompany Indebtedness to any other Borrower to the extent that such Indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Non-Company Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit Document) and (b) the value as assets of such Non-Company Borrower (as determined under the applicable provisions of such Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights held by such Non-Company Borrower, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document, then the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Non-Company Borrower, any Bank, the Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. Section 9.21 Amendment and Restatement. Upon satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended and restated by this Agreement, provided that this Agreement does not constitute and 82
shall not be construed as a novation of or a payment and readvance of the loan principal, interest and other sums, if any, heretofore outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. Section 9.22 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO SECTION 26.02 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LOAN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT EXCEEDS $50,000 IN VALUE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNLESS THE LOAN AGREEMENT IS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTY TO BE BOUND OR THAT PARTY'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE. THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO AN AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH SHALL BE DETERMINED SOLELY FROM THE WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT, AND ANY PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE SUPERSEDED BY AND MERGED INTO THE LOAN AGREEMENT. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS, AS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

INTRODUCTION A. This Agreement is given in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of September 26, 2003 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented, renewed, extended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among Arkansas Best Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ABF Aviation, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, ABF Cartage, Inc., a Delaware corporation, ABF Farms, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, ABF Freight System, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Agricultural Express of America, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Clipper Exxpress Company, a Delaware corporation, Arkansas Best Airplane Leasing, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, Tread-Ark Investment Corporation, a Nevada corporation, Data-Tronics Corp., an Arkansas corporation, Fleetnet America, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Transport Realty, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, and Tread-Ark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the "Borrowers"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), Fleet National Bank and SunTrust Bank, as Co-Syndication Agents, Wachovia Bank, National Association and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents, and the lenders parties thereto.

Each Guarantor is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company and will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. C. Under the Credit Agreement, it is a condition to the making of the Advances by the Banks and the issuance of the Letters of Credit by the Issuing Bank that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Agreement. Therefore, in order to induce the Banks to make the Advances and the Issuing Bank to issue the Letters of Credit, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: Section 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. Section 2. Guaranty.

Each Guarantor agrees that its guaranty obligation under this Agreement is a guarantee of payment, not of collection, and that such Guarantor is primarily liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Section 3. Limit of Liability. Each Guarantor shall be liable under this Agreement with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations only for amounts aggregating up to the largest amount that would not render its guaranty obligation hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law. Section 4. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or the Banks with respect thereto. The liability of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Credit Agreement or any Credit Document; (c) any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other agreement or guaranty, for any of the Guaranteed obligations; or (d) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or a Guarantor. Section 5. Continuation and Reinstatement, Etc. Each Guarantor agrees that, to the extent that the Borrowers make payment to the Agent or any Bank and such payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or otherwise required to be repaid, then to the extent of such repayment the Guaranteed Obligations shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date such initial payment occurred. The Guarantor shall defend and indemnify the Agent and each Bank from and against any claim or loss under this Section 5 (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in the defense of any such action or suit.

Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 3
7.02. Government Approval. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement. 7.03. Binding Obligations. This Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Section 8. Covenants. Each Guarantor will comply with all covenant provisions of Article V and Article VI of the Credit Agreement to the extent such provisions are applicable to a Subsidiary of the Borrower. Section 9. Contribution. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, each of the Guarantors will benefit, directly and indirectly, from the Obligations and in consideration thereof desire to enter into a contribution agreement among themselves as set forth in this Section 9 to allocate such benefits among themselves and to provide a fair and equitable arrangement to make contributions in the event any payment is made by any Guarantor hereunder to the Agent or the Banks (such payment being referred to herein as a "Contribution"). The Guarantors hereby agree as follows: 9.01. Calculation of Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Guarantors in the event any Contribution is made by a Guarantor (a "Funding Guarantor"), such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from certain other Guarantors for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in discharging any of the Obligations, in the manner and to the extent set forth in this Section 9.01. The amount of any Contribution under this Agreement shall be equal to the payment made by the Funding Guarantor to the Agent or any other beneficiary pursuant to this Agreement and shall be determined as of the date on which such payment is made. 9.02. Benefit Amount Defined. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Benefit Amount" of any Guarantor as of any date of determination shall be the net value of the benefits to such Guarantor and all of its Subsidiaries (including any Subsidiaries which may be Guarantors) from extensions of credit made by the Banks to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement; provided, that in determining the contribution liability of any Guarantor which is a Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent corporation or of any Guarantor to its direct or indirect Subsidiary, the Benefit Amount of such Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries, if any, shall be subtracted in determining the Benefit Amount of the parent corporation. Such benefits shall include benefits of funds constituting proceeds of Advances made to the Borrowers by the Banks which are in turn advanced or contributed by the Borrowers to such Guarantor or its Subsidiaries and benefits of Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement on behalf of, or the proceeds of which are advanced or contributed or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Benefits"). In the case of any proceeds of Advances or Benefits advanced or contributed to a Person of which any of the equity interests are owned directly or indirectly by a Guarantor (an "Owned Entity"), the Benefit Amount of a Guarantor with respect Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 4
thereto shall be that portion of the net value of the benefits attributable to Advances or Benefits equal to the direct or indirect percentage ownership of such Guarantor in its Owned Entity. 9.03. Contribution Obligation. Each Guarantor shall be liable to a Funding Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of (a) (i) the ratio of the Benefit Amount of such Guarantor to the total amount of Obligations, multiplied by (ii) the amount of Obligations paid by such Funding Guarantor and (b) 95% of the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities) determined as of the date on which the payment made by a Funding Guarantor is deemed made for purposes of this Agreement (giving effect to all payments made by other Funding Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions). 9.04. Allocation. In the event that at any time there exists more than one Funding Guarantor with respect to any Contribution (in any such case, the "Applicable Contribution"), then payment from other Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among such Funding Guarantors in proportion to the total amount of the Contribution made for or on account of the Borrowers by each such Funding Guarantor pursuant to the Applicable Contribution. In the event that at any time any Guarantor pays an amount under this Agreement in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to clause (a) of Section 9.03, that Guarantor shall be deemed to be a Funding Guarantor to the extent of such excess and shall be entitled to contribution from the other Guarantors in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.04. 9.05. Subsidiary Payment. The amount of contribution payable under this Section 9.05 by any Guarantor shall be reduced by the amount of any contribution paid hereunder by a Subsidiary of such Guarantor. 9.06. Equitable Allocation. If as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization or other corporate change in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or as a result of any amendment, waiver or modification of the terms and conditions of other Sections of this Agreement or the Obligations, or for any other reason, the contributions under this Section 9.06 become inequitable as among the Guarantors, the Guarantors shall promptly modify and amend this Section 9.06 to provide for an equitable allocation of contributions. Any of the foregoing modifications and amendments shall be in writing and signed by all Guarantors. 9.07. Asset of Party to Which Contribution is Owing. The Guarantors acknowledge that the right to contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the Guarantor to which such contribution is owing. 9.08. Subordination. No payments payable by a Guarantor pursuant to the terms of this Section 9 shall be paid until all amounts then due and payable by the Borrowers to any Bank, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Documents, are paid in full in cash. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall affect the indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of any Guarantor to the Agent or any Bank under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Documents. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 5
Section 10. Miscellaneous. 10.01. Addresses for Notices. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing, including telegraphic communication, and delivered or teletransmitted to the Agent, as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and to each Guarantor, at the address set forth beside such Guarantor's name on Annex 1 hereto or in the Accession Agreement executed by such Guarantor, or to such other address as shall be designated by any Guarantor or the Agent in written notice to the other parties. All such notices and other communications shall be effective when delivered or teletransmitted to the above addresses. 10.02. Amendments, Etc. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Agent, the Majority Banks and the Borrowers, and no amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Guarantor and the Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks; provided, however, that any amendment or waiver releasing any Guarantor from any liability hereunder shall be signed by all the Banks; provided, further, however, that any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Subsidiary of the Company hereafter is required in a accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or otherwise agrees to become a guarantor of the Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Documents, then such Subsidiary may become a party to this Agreement by executing an Accession Agreement ("Accession Agreement") in the form attached hereto as Annex 2, and each Guarantor and the Agent hereby agrees that, upon such Subsidiary's execution of such Accession Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been amended to make such Person a Guarantor hereunder for all purposes and a party hereto and no signature is required on behalf of the other Guarantors or the Agent to make such an amendment to this Agreement effective. 10.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Agent or any Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 10.04. Right of Set-Off. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent and the Banks are hereby authorized at any time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and other indebtedness owing by the Agent or the Banks to the account of any Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of such Guarantor under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or the Banks shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. The Agent and the Banks agree promptly to notify each Guarantor affected by any such set-off after any such set-off and application made by the Agent or the Banks provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Agent and the Banks under this Section 10.04 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Agent and the Banks may have. Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 6
10.05. Continuing Guaranty; Transfer of Interest. This Agreement shall create a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full and termination of the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors, and assigns, and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent, the Banks and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause, when any Bank assigns or otherwise transfers any interest held by it under the Credit Agreement or other Credit Document to any other Person pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement or other Credit Document, that other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits held by such Bank under this Agreement. Subject to Section 5, upon the payment in full and termination of the Guaranteed Obligations, the guaranties granted hereby shall terminate and all rights hereunder shall revert to each Guarantor to the extent such rights have not been applied pursuant to the terms hereof. Subject to Section 5, upon any such termination, the Agent will, at each Guarantor's expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor shall reasonably request and take any other actions reasonably requested to evidence or effect such termination. 10.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Texas state or federal court sitting in Dallas, Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any right it may have to the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to such Guarantor at its address specified below. Each Guarantor agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 10.06 shall affect the rights of any Bank or the Agent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by the law or affect the right of any Bank or the Agent to bring any action or proceeding against any Guarantor or its Property in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 10.07. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY OR TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. 10.08. Binding Arbitration. (a) Arbitration. The Guarantors and the Agent agree, upon demand, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or among them (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise arising out of or relating to in any way this Agreement or the Credit Documents and their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 7
repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default or termination. (b) Governing Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a location in Texas selected by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"); (ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA, or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA's commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA's optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to, as applicable, as the "Rules"). If there is any inconsistency between the terms ----- hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Any Person who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other Person shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other Person in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any Person that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar applicable state law. (c) No Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any Person to (i) foreclose against real or personal property collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any Person to submit any dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 10.08(c) . (d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the State of Texas with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator's discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Texas and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 8
and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Person, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other Person contests such action for judicial relief. (e) Discovery. In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date and within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the such Person's presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available. (f) Class Proceedings and Consolidations. The resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by a separate arbitration proceeding and such dispute shall not be consolidated with other disputes or included in any class proceeding. (g) Payment Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding. (h) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators, the Guarantors and the Agent shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other Person that is a party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a Person required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the Guarantors and the Agent potentially applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to this Agreement or the Credit Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Credit Documents or any relationship between or among the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and/or the Banks. 10.09.

PURSUANT TO SECTION 26.02 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LOAN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT EXCEEDS $50,000 IN VALUE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNLESS THE LOAN AGREEMENT IS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTY TO BE BOUND OR THAT PARTY'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.

If any sums shall be paid to any Guarantor or any Affiliate of a Guarantor by any Debtor or any other Person on account of the Subordinated Indebtedness when such payment is not permitted hereunder, such sums shall be held in trust by such Guarantor or such Affiliate of a Guarantor for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks and shall forthwith be delivered to the Agent without affecting the liability of such Guarantor or such Affiliate of a Guarantor under this Agreement and may be applied by the Agent against the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Upon the request of the Agent, each Guarantor shall execute, deliver and endorse to the Agent such documentation as the Agent may request to perfect, preserve and enforce its rights hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement and with respect to each Guarantor, the term "Subordinated Indebtedness" means all indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other than such Guarantor (the Company and such Subsidiaries of the Borrower hereinafter called the "Debtors") to such Guarantor, whether such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations now exist or are hereafter incurred or arise, or are primary, absolute, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed, contingent, liquidated, unliquidated, secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, joint, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of whether such indebtedness, liabilities or obligations are evidenced by a note, contract, open account or otherwise, and irrespective of the Person or Persons in whose favor such indebtedness, obligations or liabilities may, at their inception, have been, or may hereafter be created, or the manner in which they have been or may hereafter be acquired by such Guarantor; (b) Any and all Liens (including any judgment Liens) upon any Debtor's property or assets securing payment of any Subordinated Indebtedness (the "Subordinated Liens") shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any and all Liens, if any exist, upon any Debtor's assets securing payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, regardless of whether such Subordinated Liens presently exist or are hereafter created or when such Subordinated Liens Exhibit D to Credit Agreement - Page 10
were created, perfected, filed or recorded. Each Guarantor shall not exercise or enforce any creditors' rights or remedies that it may have against any Debtor or foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise institute any action or proceeding (whether judicial or otherwise, including, without limitation, the commencement of, or joinder in, any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, receivership or other debtor relief law) to enforce any Subordinated Lien on any property or assets of any Debtor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been irrevocably paid and performed in full; (c) In the event of any receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, rearrangement, debtor's relief or other insolvency proceeding involving any Debtor as debtor, the Agent shall have the right to prove and vote any claim under the Subordinated Indebtedness and to receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian all dividends, distributions and payments made in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness until the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid and performed in full. The Agent may apply any such dividends, distributions and payments against the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the Credit Agreement; (d) All promissory notes, accounts receivable, ledgers, records or any other evidence of Subordinated Indebtedness, and all mortgages, deeds of trust, security agreements, assignments and other security documents evidencing the Subordinated Liens, shall contain a specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness and Liens evidenced thereby are subordinated under the terms of this Agreement; and (e) The terms and provisions of this Section 10.10 are given by each Guarantor as additional rights, remedies and benefits to any and all other subordination agreements heretofore, concurrently herewith or hereafter executed by such Guarantor to or in favor of the Agent or any Bank, and nothing in this Agreement shall ever be deemed to in any way negate or replace any other such previous, concurrent or subsequent subordination agreements.

EXHIBIT K FORM OF BORROWERS'/GUARANTORS' COUNSEL OPINION September 26, 2003 To Each of the Banks Party to the Credit Agreement and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks Ladies and Gentlemen: I have acted as counsel to Arkansas Best Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ABF Aviation, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, ABF Cartage, Inc., a Delaware corporation, ABF Farms, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, ABF Freight System, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Agricultural Express of America, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Clipper Exxpress Company, a Delaware corporation, Arkansas Best Airplane Leasing, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, Tread-Ark Investment Corporation, a Nevada corporation, Data-Tronics Corp., an Arkansas corporation, Fleetnet America, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Transport Realty, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, and Tread-Ark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the "Borrowers"), and the Guarantors in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of September 26, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrowers, the lending institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), Fleet National Bank and SunTrust Bank, as Co-Syndication Agents, Wachovia Bank, National Association and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Agent"). I have been requested to render this opinion pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iv) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. For purposes of this opinion, the Borrowers and the Guarantors are collectively referred to as the "Loan Parties". In connection with this opinion, I have examined and relied upon the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate documents and records of the Loan Parties and have received such information from officers and representatives of the Loan Parties as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable me to express the opinions expressed below. I have also relied on certificates of officers of the Loan Parties and certificates of public officials as to certain factual matters. For purposes of this opinion, I have also examined each of the Credit Documents. In rendering my opinion, I have assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures, (b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, (c) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, and (d) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents referred to herein by the parties thereto other than the Loan Parties. Exhibit L to Credit Agreement - Page 1
Based on the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth below, and as may be disclosed in the Credit Documents, I am of the opinion that: 1. Each of the Loan Parties is a corporation duly incorporated or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdictions of its incorporation or organization (as applicable). 2. Each of the Loan Parties has the requisite power to own or hold under lease its assets and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. 3. Each of the Loan Parties is duly qualified as a foreign entity and is authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of any of the Loan Parties. 4. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending or threatened against or affecting any of the Loan Parties or the rights of any of the Loan Parties which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, operations or business of any of the Loan Parties or the ability of any of the Loan Parties to perform its respective obligations under the Credit Documents. 5. None of (a) the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents, (b) the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, or (c) compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will (i) violate or result in a breach of, or require any consent under, the certificate or articles, as the case may be, of incorporation or organization or bylaws or other constitutional document of any of the Loan Parties, or any law or regulation applicable to any of the Loan Parties, or any of their respective properties, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or Governmental Authority or agency known to us after due inquiry, (ii) violate or result in a breach of or a default under any material agreement, document or instrument to which any of the Loan Parties is a party or by which any of the Loan Parties or their respective properties are bound, known to us after due inquiry (a "Material Contract"), or (iii) except for the Liens permitted by the Agreement, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the revenues or assets of any of the Loan Parties pursuant to the terms of any such Material Contract. 6. Each of the Loan Parties has all necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Loan Parties of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and the obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action. 7. Each of the Credit Documents to which any Loan Party is a party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Loan Party and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Loan Party enforceable against it in accordance with their respective Exhibit L to Credit Agreement - Page 2
terms, except that the enforceability thereof may be limited (a) by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 8. No authorizations, approvals or consents of, or filings or registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency are necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by any of the Loan Parties of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, except for authorizations, consents and approvals that have already been obtained and filings which have already been made. 9. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). 10. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 11. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary of a holding company" or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "public utility" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. The opinions expressed herein are as of the date hereof only, and I assume no obligation to update or supplement such opinions to reflect any fact or circumstance that may hereafter come to my attention or any change in law that may occur or become effective. The foregoing opinion is, with your concurrence, predicated upon and qualified in its entirety by the following: I am a member of the Bar of the State of Arkansas, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction, other than the Federal Laws of the United States of America, the Laws of the State of Arkansas, the Delaware General Corporation Law, and Delaware limited liability company law. Insofar as the foregoing opinion involves agreements that purport to be governed by Texas or other states' laws, I have assumed that such law is the same as the Law of the State of Arkansas.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS; ABF(R)'S THIRD QUARTER OPERATING RATIO IMPROVES TO 91.9% (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 20, 2003) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2003 net income of $17.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share. For the third quarter of 2002, net income was $18.3 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share. Excluding three items of note, third quarter 2002 earnings were $0.54 per diluted common share. The three items of note during the third quarter of 2002 included: an earnings increase of $0.12 per diluted common share related to a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, an earnings increase of $0.09 per diluted common share associated with the after-tax gains on sales of excess freight facilities at ABF and an earnings decrease of $0.02 per diluted common share relating to increased liability reserves associated with the liquidation of an insurer who provides excess workers' compensation insurance for claims that arose from 1993 through 1999. Arkansas Best's revenue, during the third quarter of 2003, was $402.9 million, an increase of 7.3% over the third quarter of 2002. ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC.(R) ABF Freight System, the company's largest subsidiary, had third quarter 2003 revenue of $360.6 million, a per-day increase of 7.5% compared to third quarter 2002 revenue of $335.5 million. ABF's third quarter 2003 operating ratio was 91.9% versus an operating ratio of 92.9% during the third quarter of 2002. This year's third quarter operating ratio at ABF was the third best for any third quarter in the last twenty-five years. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, including fuel surcharge, was $24.39, an increase of 6.5% over last year's third quarter figure of $22.91. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $23.60, an increase of 5.4% over last year's third quarter figure of $22.39. Approximately one-half of the yield increase, excluding fuel surcharge, was a result of changes in the freight profile since the early September 2002 demise of Consolidated Freightways (CF). "We remain encouraged by the
positive pricing environment currently experienced by our industry," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "ABF's increases on contracts and deferred pricing agreements continue to be favorable by historical standards and retention of the July 14 general rate increase has been good." ABF's third quarter LTL tonnage per day increased 0.5% compared to the same period last year. Versus the second quarter of 2003, ABF's third quarter LTL tonnage per day increased 2.8%. "ABF's sequential LTL tonnage change compared to this year's second quarter was in line with expected changes given normal seasonal trends from the second quarter to the third quarter," said Mr. Young. Comparisons of third quarter 2003 LTL tonnage to the same figures in the third quarter of 2002 include additional business in September of both years associated with CF's closing. "Our business does not yet reflect much of a change in the overall economy of our country. I continue to be encouraged about the positive signs and comments from others regarding the improving economic environment. If the economy does improve, this should eventually translate into more business for ABF. Regardless of economic conditions, ABF will continue to emphasize excellent customer service while managing costs to provide superior value to its customers," said Mr. Young. "ABF's third quarter operating ratio of 91.9% compares very favorably to this year's second quarter operating ratio of 95.7%," said Mr. Young. "This was due, primarily, to yield improvements but also reflects some positive operational effects from seasonal increases in tonnage and revenue without the addition of an equivalent amount of costs." "Productivity measures at ABF were slightly below levels for the same period last year. These figures continue to be affected by additional shipment handling related to ABF's concentration on transit time improvements and premium services provided at pickup and delivery," said Mr. Young. "These measures were the same as in the second quarter of this year." RECOGNITION OF EXCELLENCE AT ABF Continuing its long pattern of recognition for superior industry achievement, ABF and its employees were recently recognized with two more prestigious safety awards. In mid-September, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) named ABF as the winner of its 2003 President's Trophy for safety. This is the highest safety award in the motor carrier industry. ABF is the only carrier to have won this award five times.
Earlier this month, the ATA also named Jim McFarlin, director of safety and security for ABF, as the 2003 Safety Director of the Year. This award is presented annually to the motor carrier safety executive whose professional qualifications, safety programs and achievements are considered outstanding. Jim also won the Outstanding Service Award for safety in 2000. "Safety is a very high priority at ABF. It is gratifying to have our employees and safety programs continue to be recognized as the very best in the trucking industry," said Mr. Young. ABF'S REDESIGNED WEB SITE In early August, ABF announced the launch of its re-engineered Web site at abf.com which offers a simpler graphical interface, streamlined applications and industry-first advances in automated personalization. This new design allows for the matching of the most relevant online tools and shipment information to the specific site user. CLIPPER For the third quarter of 2003, Clipper had revenues of $34.0 million compared to $32.4 million in the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 4.9%. Clipper's third quarter 2003 operating ratio was 98.2% versus 97.7% during the same period last year. "During the third quarter, the intermodal portion of Clipper's dry freight, full-load business continued to experience significant year-over-year increases in revenues and margins," said Mr. Young. "However, this was offset by revenues and profit declines at Clipper's temperature-controlled division. These declines were caused by continued softness in the demand for produce moving off the West Coast," said Mr. Young. "In addition, competition from truckload operators reduced the margins per load Clipper experienced during this year's third quarter as compared to the same period last year." COMMON STOCK PURCHASE During the third quarter of 2003, Arkansas Best did not make any open market purchases of its common stock. In total, as a part of Arkansas Best's previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, the company has purchased 200,000 shares totaling $4.8 million during 2003. CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENSION As previously reported, as of Friday, September 26, 2003, Arkansas Best amended and restated its existing $225 million Credit Agreement. The agreement was extended for two years and is now scheduled to mature on May 15, 2007. Arkansas Best continues to have a strong balance sheet and closed the third quarter with total debt below $20 million.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 26, 2004)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced fourth quarter 2003 net income of $14.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share, compared to fourth quarter 2002 net income of $14.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share. Excluding a net earnings impact of $0.03 per diluted common share associated with the sale of Clipper Exxpress's LTL customer and vendor lists and Clipper's subsequent exit from the LTL business, fourth quarter 2003 earnings were $0.55 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's revenue during the fourth quarter of 2003 was $387.1 million, an increase of 1.5% over the fourth quarter of 2002.
     "Arkansas Best had another solid performance in 2003, highlighted by a 13.2% After-Tax Return on Capital Employed. Arkansas Best ended 2003 with no outstanding debt on its revolving credit facility," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "In spite of minimal increases in yearly LTL tonnage levels, ABF improved its full year 2003 operating ratio to 94.3% with a revenue increase of 7.3%. Though tonnage declined in the fourth quarter from the previous year, it was actually stronger than we anticipated based on typical sequential trends. Arkansas Best's balance sheet strength combined with ABF's continued strong operational performance, as illustrated by a fourth quarter 2003 operating ratio of 93.5%, puts our company in a good position to take advantage of a promising economic outlook and other opportunities that exist within the trucking industry."
     Arkansas Best's superior financial performance was recognized, for the fourth year in a row, by magazine. In its January 12, 2004 issue, Arkansas Best once again was named as one of The Platinum 400 Best Big Companies in America. Based on calculation formula, Arkansas Best's 5-year annualized total return of 39.5% was the #1 return in the
Forbes
Forbes'
 
"Transportation" industry sector and the 22nd highest return of all "400 Best Big Companies" recognized.
     For the full year of 2003, the company reported income of $46.1 million, or $1.81 per diluted common share. Excluding several items of note, full year 2003 earnings were $1.66 per diluted common share. The following table provides the reconciliation of GAAP earnings and earnings per share for the full year of 2003:
     Before the cumulative effect of an accounting change, 2002 income was $40.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's 2003 full year revenue was $1.53 billion, an increase of 7.4% over 2002 full year revenue.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, the company's largest subsidiary, had revenues of $348.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2003, a per-day increase of 1.0% compared to fourth quarter 2002 revenue of $344.9 million. ABF's operating income during the current quarter was $22.8 million compared to $27.1 million in the same period last year. ABF's fourth quarter 2003 operating ratio was 93.5%, compared to an operating ratio of 92.2% during the fourth quarter of 2002.
     Fourth quarter billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, including fuel surcharge, was $23.89, an increase of 2.7% over the fourth quarter 2002 figure of $23.27. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $23.07, an increase of 2.3% over last year's fourth quarter figure of $22.56. "The pricing environment is competitive but ABF continues to price rationally and manage effectively during this period of slight business improvement," said Mr. Young.
 
     Fourth quarter 2003 LTL tonnage per day decreased 2.3% when compared to the 2002 fourth quarter. "Since September, the one-year anniversary of the closure of Consolidated Freightways, monthly LTL tonnages have declined when compared to the same month of 2002. However, compared to the September monthly year-over-year tonnage changes, declines were less severe during the fourth quarter. For instance, September 2003's year-over-year LTL tonnage decline of 5.4% compares to declines of 2.0% in October 2003, 3.1% in November 2003 and 1.3% in December," said Mr. Young. "In addition, considering sequential, historical trends versus September, fourth quarter 2003 LTL tonnage is running approximately 2% better than expected. These business changes are very encouraging and suggest that the improving U.S. economy is benefiting the general freight market."
     Fourth quarter 2003 truckload tonnage per day increased by 7.0% versus the fourth quarter of 2002. "Because of tightening capacity in the truckload industry, ABF was able to obtain a greater number of these larger shipments," said Mr. Young.
     "Productivity measures at ABF were below those of the fourth quarter of 2002. As seen in the third quarter, additional shipment handling related to ABF's concentration on transit time improvements and premium services provided at pickup and delivery adversely affected these measures," said Mr. Young.
     ABF's fourth quarter 2003 operating ratio was greater than the operating ratio of the fourth quarter of 2002 for several reasons. The decline in quarterly business levels negatively impacted ABF's profitability, as some fixed costs remained in the system in spite of tonnage reductions. As discussed earlier, declines in productivity contributed to higher labor and fringe costs. Depreciation expenses rose by approximately $1.3 million because of increased depreciation on some road tractors and road trailers to reflect reductions in expected salvage values based on current market conditions.
     ABF's quarterly purchased transportation costs increased over the fourth quarter of 2002 because of additional business in ABF's traditional West Coast rail lanes. This required ABF to use a greater amount of rail to transport this freight and to minimize the movement of empty ABF equipment across the country.
 
     For the full year of 2003, ABF's revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 7.3% over 2002 revenue. ABF's 2003 operating ratio was 94.3% versus 94.6% in 2002. ABF's 2003 operating income was $77.8 million versus $68.8 million during 2002. Total tonnage per day in 2003 was approximately equal to that of 2002. LTL tonnage per day during 2003 increased 0.7% over 2002 levels and truckload tonnage per day decreased 2.6% versus 2002. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $22.99, an increase of 4.9% over last year's full year figure of $21.91.
New Federal Hours of Service Regulations
     Much has been written and discussed about the new federal Hours of Service regulations that went into effect on January 4, 2004. The new rule changes are designed to improve highway safety by reducing fatigue, thus saving lives and preventing accidents. Due to its long-standing commitment to safety, ABF has supported these changes, which are generally reasonable and logical. The operational impact on ABF's over-the-road, linehaul relay network will be modest, although we anticipate a small decline in driver and equipment utilization offset by the opportunity to further improve transit times. The truckload industry anticipates significantly higher costs associated with driver pay, customer delays and increased charges for stop-off and detention services. As a result, ABF believes that opportunities will exist to handle some larger shipments that have recently been moving by truckload carriers.
Recognition of Excellence at ABF
     During November, ABF was once again recognized for achievements in the areas of technology. ABF earned two awards in magazine's annual listing of the top 100 enterprise projects using information technology to creatively achieve business goals. These awards were associated with ABF's Web site and its NetLink system, a system that uses wireless technology to streamline procedures across ABF's network. "ABF continues to provide value through improvements in the level of information and shipment visibility available to its customers. ABF's Web site has been a significant factor in those improvements," said Mr. Young. "The real-time information available through the NetLink system greatly enhances the customized services ABF offers its customers and allows our employees to work more economically and effectively."
InfoWorld
 
     Also in November, ABF was named by magazine as one of the top seven companies to sell for in the service sector of the United States economy. This is the second consecutive year ABF has been recognized with this honor, placing among the top 10 in both years. "The comprehensive training and professional development of ABF's sales force are essential elements associated with this award," said Mr. Young. "Providing the necessary tools to people who listen and react to the needs of customers will continue to be a key to ABF's success."
Selling Power
Sale of Clipper Exxpress's LTL Division
     On December 31, 2003, Arkansas Best's subsidiary, Clipper Exxpress Company, closed the sale of all customer and vendor lists related to Clipper's LTL freight business to Hercules Forwarding Inc. of Vernon, California for $2.7 million in cash, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $2.5 million. This gain is reported below the operating income line. Costs associated with closure of this business unit, including severance pay, software and fixed asset abandonment and certain operating leases amounted to $1.2 million. These closure costs are considered to be fourth quarter 2003 operating costs and are reported above the operating income line.
Clipper
     During the fourth quarter of 2003, Clipper had revenues of $31.3 million versus $30.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Clipper's fourth quarter 2003 operating ratio was 104.1% versus 98.9% during the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding the $1.2 million of operating costs associated with the closure of the LTL business unit, Clipper's fourth quarter 2003 operating ratio was 100.1%. "As seen throughout the year, the intermodal portion of Clipper's dry freight, full-load business experienced strong revenue growth during the fourth quarter, compared to last year. Though quarterly revenues at Clipper's temperature-controlled division were down versus last year, margins on this segment of the business improved significantly," said Mr. Young. "These positive quarterly trends were offset by the fourth quarter results, excluding exit costs, of the LTL business unit. The poor performance of Clipper's LTL operation continued as deteriorating, fourth quarter revenue further declined following the early December announcement of the sale to Hercules."
     For the full year 2003, revenues at Clipper were $126.8 million compared to $118.9 million during 2002. Clipper's full year 2003 operating ratio was 100.3% versus 99.1% during all of 2002. Excluding the $1.2 million of operating costs associated with the closure of the LTL business unit, Clipper's full year 2003 operating ratio was 99.3%. "With the year-end exit of
 
Clipper from its LTL business, we expect improved margins at this subsidiary during 2004," said Mr. Young. "Clipper's LTL division accounted for approximately 30% of total Clipper revenues. In recent years, the profitability of this portion of Clipper's business had suffered, primarily, from the negative effects of the U.S. economy," said Mr. Young. "Clipper retains the intermodal and temperature-controlled truckload business moving on the rail, as well as its brokerage operation. During 2004, Clipper will focus on consistent growth of its remaining business segments with emphasis on individual account profitability."
Capital Expenditures
     In 2004, Arkansas Best estimates net capital expenditures to be approximately $76 million. This consists of $55 million for revenue equipment replacements, $14 million for real estate purchases and additions and $7 million of other capital expenditures. Arkansas Best's depreciation and amortization for 2004 is estimated to be approximately $59 million.
Pension
     As previously reported, during 2003 Arkansas Best made $15.0 million of tax-deductible contributions to its pension plan. At the end of 2003, Arkansas Best's pension plan assets were $156.9 million, which exceeded the plan's projected benefit obligation by $5.8 million and the plan's accumulated benefit obligation by $34.6 million. The projected benefit obligation includes projected salary increases, and the accumulated benefit obligation does not. In 2004, Arkansas Best anticipates having no required pension contributions and no allowable, tax-deductible pension contributions.
     Arkansas Best has evaluated its pension plan assumptions and will use 8.25% as its 2004 investment return assumption and 6.01% as its discount rate assumption for 2004 plan liabilities. These rates compare to 7.90% for investment returns and 6.90% for plan liabilities for 2003.
Common Stock Purchase
     During the fourth quarter of 2003, Arkansas Best did not make any open market purchases of its common stock. In total, as a part of a previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, Arkansas Best purchased 200,000 shares totaling $4.8 million during 2003.
 
ABF Business Trends and Items of Note
     This information describes certain aspects of ABF's historical operating performance characteristics and is not intended to be a projection or prediction.
     Because of changes that have occurred in the LTL industry since the closure of Consolidated Freightways in September 2002, sequential comparisons of business levels are often more revealing than year-over-year comparisons. An analysis of the 1998 through 2002 sequential relationship between fourth quarter LTL tonnage levels and subsequent first quarter LTL tonnage levels reveals a seasonal decline in ABF's LTL tonnage per day. Applying this historical relationship to actual LTL tonnage-per-day figures for the fourth quarter of 2003 yields a first quarter 2004 LTL daily tonnage figure that is generally comparable to the LTL daily tonnage level of the first quarter of 2003. It is not known at this time if this historical level of change will, in fact, occur in the first quarter of 2004 relative to the first quarter of 2003. This sequential tonnage analysis is only a starting point for predicting upcoming business levels. The effects of various economic and industry factors must also be considered.
     The first quarter generally has the highest operating ratio of the year. First quarter tonnage levels are normally lower during January and February while March provides a disproportionately higher amount of the quarter's business. Adverse weather conditions in the early months of the first quarter can have a negative impact on productivity and costs. As the weather improves, business levels tend to increase and the operating results of March often have a significant impact on the first quarter's results. These observations are made based ABF's historical operating performance.

     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the Company's 2003 fourth quarter and full year results.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 21, 2004, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2004 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures of earnings and earnings per share. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because they provide a more comparable measure of earnings and earnings per share. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 21, 2004)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced first quarter 2004 net income of $4.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share. During the first quarter of 2003, the company reported a net loss of $734,000, or $0.03 per common share, which included a $9.0 million pre-tax ($0.22 per common share) charge related to Arkansas Best's interest rate swap. Excluding this charge, first quarter 2003 earnings were $0.19 per common share.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF's revenue during the first quarter of 2004 was $346.1 million, a per-day increase of 3.0% compared to first quarter 2003 revenue of $330.8 million. These figures reflect a revenue reclassification in both years, which is discussed below. First quarter 2004 operating income at ABF was $8.7 million compared to $11.1 million during the first quarter of 2003. ABF's first quarter 2004 operating ratio was 97.5% versus an operating ratio of 96.6% during the first quarter of 2003. "Because of low business levels in January and February, ABF's normal cost increases had a greater impact on first quarter margins," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "March's average LTL daily tonnage was approximately 10% above that in January and over 4% above that in February. The availability of additional business in March translated into a significant improvement in ABF's bottom-line results over January and February."
     ABF's LTL tonnage per day increased slightly by 0.3% during the first three months of 2004 compared to the same period last year. "Looking at the individual months of this year's first quarter, profitability improvements were consistent with positive changes in business.
 
During January, when LTL tonnage per day was 2.3% below last year, ABF's operating ratio was 101.5%. In February, when LTL tonnage levels increased 1.4% over last year, ABF's operating ratio improved to 97.9%. In March, when daily LTL tonnage was 1.3% better than March 2003, ABF's 93.7% operating ratio reflected further margin improvement," said Mr. Young.
     "Through the first nineteen days of April, average daily tonnage figures in our core LTL business are approximately 5% higher than the comparable period last year. We are encouraged by the positive tonnage pattern ABF is experiencing so far in the second quarter," said Mr. Young.
     Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $23.47, an increase of 2.0% over last year's first quarter figure of $23.02. Yield comparisons with last year's first quarter are affected by freight profile differences. Shipments added in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of the September 2002 closure of Consolidated Freightways were generally smaller and moved longer distances. These profile characteristics increased ABF's first quarter 2003 yields. Growth in average shipment size and a reduction in length of haul caused some decline in first quarter 2004 revenue per hundredweight. Without these profile changes, ABF's first quarter billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 2.4% over first quarter last year.
     ABF's truckload tonnage per day improved by 10.0% during the first quarter when compared to last year. "The number of larger shipments increased during the first quarter, as the federal Hours of Service Regulations prompted the move of these shipments from truckload carriers. In addition, during the first half of the quarter, ABF was more active in the volume spot market in an attempt to increase capacity utilization to offset seasonally soft business levels. ABF did benefit from handling these additional truckload shipments. However, the competitive pricing necessary to obtain these one-time shipments produced margins that were below those of ABF's normal business. As a result, ABF's overall first quarter operating ratio increased," said Mr. Young. "As LTL tonnage trends improved during the second half of the quarter, ABF was more selective in the spot quotation market, increasing prices and margins. As seasonal LTL business levels continue to increase in the coming months, ABF should continue to see improved margins on these volume shipments."
 
     ABF is in the midst of an ongoing initiative to reduce transit-time delivery standards and to further improve the on-time reliability of transit-time service to its customers. To accomplish this goal, technology is being utilized to improve the focus of ABF's system resources. So far, this activity has resulted in a year-over-year reduction of shipment deliveries not meeting ABF's transit-time standards by nearly one half. "The operational focus associated with these improved services has increased ABF's costs, though they are difficult to quantify because they affect so many areas of ABF's operation. However, these changes are being made to provide better, more reliable transit times for our customers," said Mr. Young. "In addition, ABF believes these changes will generate future opportunities for new revenue growth."
     Depreciation expenses were above last year's first quarter by approximately $1.1 million. Approximately $870,000 of the additional depreciation costs were associated with new trailers and with road tractors converted to city tractors, both of which were replacements for older equipment. Arkansas Best previously disclosed an expected additional increase in first quarter 2004 depreciation of approximately $750,000 due to the downward adjustment of equipment salvage values. Because of improvements in the market for equipment values, first quarter 2004 depreciation cost increases related to salvage value reductions are only $250,000.
     First quarter productivity measures at ABF, on a bills-per-hour basis, were below those seen during the first quarter of 2003. "However, the first quarter weight-per-shipment increase reduced the bills-per-hour productivity measure of ABF's workforce. On a weight-per-hour basis, which is a better measure considering the profile change, productivity improved by 1.6%," said Mr. Young.
ABF Revenue Reclassification
     First quarter 2004 revenue includes the effect of a reclassification to record revenue associated with certain shipments where ABF utilizes a third-party carrier for pickup or delivery. The same reclassification has been made for first quarter 2003. This applies to shipments where ABF retains the primary obligation to provide services to the customer and where ABF maintains the responsibility for collection of accounts receivable and handling of cargo claims. This revenue will now be recorded on a gross basis, with expenses paid to the third-party carrier recorded in the "purchased transportation" category, rather than on a net basis where the expense of the third-party carrier is netted against revenue. This reclassification increases ABF's revenue
 
by nearly two percent, has no impact on ABF's operating income and a minimal impact on ABF's operating ratio.
Clipper
     Clipper's first quarter 2004 revenue was $20.9 million. Excluding the revenue associated with Clipper's LTL freight business, whose sale was closed on December 31, 2003, Clipper's revenue in the first quarter of 2003 was $19.8 million. "Clipper's intermodal business segment continued to experience strong revenue growth as shown by a 13.3% per-day increase over last year. Though offset by revenue declines in other divisions, this was the main reason for Clipper's total revenue increase, excluding LTL," said Mr. Young.
     Clipper's first quarter 2004 operating ratio was 102.8% compared to a 2003 first quarter operating ratio, excluding LTL, of 100.6%. "Revenues and margins at Clipper's temperature-controlled division were down versus last year as fewer shipments were available for handling," said Mr. Young. "In addition, the loss of the sales support previously provided by Clipper's LTL division contributed to lost business and a shipment decline in its brokerage unit. Finally, Clipper was not able to grow the revenues of the remaining business units to cover its overhead costs. Moving beyond the historically weak first quarter, seasonal increases in business should provide additional revenues to help cover these costs."
     During the first quarter, which is typically the least profitable, Clipper continued to adjust its mix of accounts in order to identify those with the potential for good margins. Following its exit from the LTL business, Clipper believes that the long-term profitability of its remaining operations should improve.
Pension
     Arkansas Best previously provided an estimated range of $6 million to $7 million for its 2004 pension expense. Due primarily to errors in the estimates made by Arkansas Best's actuaries, pension expense will actually be $9.5 million for the full year 2004. This compares to 2003 pension expense of $11.1 million. Arkansas Best now anticipates making a $1 million to $2 million, tax-deductible contribution to its pension plan in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Common Stock Purchase
     During the first quarter of 2004, Arkansas Best made open-market purchases, totaling 131,400 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $3.9 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since February 2003, as a part of a previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, Arkansas Best has purchased a total of 331,400 shares totaling $8.7 million. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2004 first quarter results. The call will be today, Wednesday, April 21, at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 20, 2004, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2004 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures of earnings and earnings per share. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because they provide a more comparable measure of earnings and earnings per share. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.

Table of Contents

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 20, 2004)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2004 net income of $19.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share, compared to second quarter 2003 net income of $15.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share. Excluding an after-tax charge of $1.6 million ($0.06 per diluted common share) related to increased reserves associated with the previously announced insolvency of one of Arkansas Best's workers' compensation excess claims insurers, second quarter 2004 earnings were $0.82 per diluted common share. Excluding a gain of $0.33 per diluted common share associated with the sale of Arkansas Best's 19% interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC, second quarter 2003 earnings were $0.27 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's second quarter 2004 revenue was $424.5 million compared to $384.8 million in the second quarter of 2003.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had second quarter 2004 revenues of $391.0 million, a per-day increase of 13.6% compared to second quarter 2003 revenue of $344.1 million. Second quarter 2004 operating income at ABF was $32.8 million compared to $14.6 million during the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 125%. ABF's second quarter 2004 operating ratio was 91.6% versus an operating ratio of 95.8% during the second quarter of 2003. "ABF greatly benefited from an increase in business that began in February, surged in April and continued throughout the entire second quarter," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "During the poor economic environment of the last several years, I have talked about the significant operating leverage and improved margins ABF could generate with additional business. This year's second quarter results illustrate this point."
 
     ABF's second quarter 2004 LTL tonnage per day increased by 7.8% versus the same period last year. Compared to this year's first quarter, ABF's second quarter 2004 LTL tonnage per day increased by 9.8%. "Following minimal increases in February and March, ABF's year-over-year LTL tonnage levels began to dramatically improve in April by percentages not seen in several years. In addition, the year-over-year increase in LTL tonnage grew during each successive month of the second quarter, indicating economic momentum throughout the quarter," said Mr. Young. "ABF is benefiting from overall general economic recovery, particularly in the domestic manufacturing sector. We believe that ABF was delayed in experiencing the business growth seen earlier by other carriers because of the manufacturing concentration of its core business."
     Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, was $24.06, an increase of 3.8% over last year's second quarter figure of $23.19. "As business grows and capacity tightens, the general pricing environment is improving," said Mr. Young. "The retention of the June 14 general rate increase has been good. In addition, ABF is reviewing the portions of its business that are not generating adequate returns in order to address specific situations and improve overall profitability."
     ABF's truckload tonnage per day improved by 10.9% during the second quarter when compared to last year. Billed truckload revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 5.6% over last year's second quarter figure. "There has been significant tightening of pricing in the truckload environment," said Mr. Young. "Beginning in mid-February and continuing throughout the second quarter, ABF raised prices in its truckload spot quotation market. In spite of these actions, business levels remained strong and profits on this business improved. ABF is clearly seeing additional freight that was formerly handled by truckload carriers. However, we believe this is related more to an overall tightening of general truckload capacity due to the improving economy rather than to the effects of the changes in the federal Hours of Service Regulations."
     "On a bills-per-hour basis, second quarter productivity measures at ABF equaled those of the second quarter of 2003 and generally surpassed those of the prior three quarters," said Mr. Young. "The additional freight ABF handled in the second quarter was a positive factor contributing to ABF's productivity improvements."
     "In order to take full advantage of its remaining operating leverage, ABF does not generally need to add fixed cost capacity. Since LTL tonnage per day in the second quarter of
 
2004 was still 6% below that in the same period of the highly profitable year of 2000, ABF's fixed cost network has some available capacity," said Mr. Young. "As a result, there is more potential for even greater utilization of these resources. Despite its focus on maintaining existing fixed cost levels, ABF will add the variable costs necessary to handle additional business while sustaining its high standard of customer service."
Clipper
     Clipper's second quarter 2004 revenue was $25.0 million. Excluding the revenue associated with Clipper's LTL freight business, whose sale was closed on December 31, 2003, Clipper's revenue in the second quarter of 2003 was $24.0 million. "Clipper's temperature-controlled division experienced revenue growth of 14.5%, reflecting strength in both the produce and non-produce portions of the business," said Mr. Young. "The positive effects of these significant revenue trends were somewhat reduced by flat year-over-year combined revenue in Clipper's intermodal and brokerage business segments."
     Clipper's second quarter 2004 operating ratio was 97.1% compared to a second quarter 2003 operating ratio, excluding LTL, of 95.5%. "Second quarter 2004 operating costs were adversely affected by higher rail rates associated with tightened rail capacity, increased fuel costs and higher drayage expenses resulting from the California independent truckers strike which disrupted rail service throughout the West," said Mr. Young. "In addition, though improved second quarter shipment levels provided additional revenues to help better cover overhead expenses, Clipper's profitability continues to be adversely impacted by overhead costs."
Workers' Compensation Reserve Adjustments
     Arkansas Best's second quarter 2004 net income and earnings per share were adversely affected by increased workers' compensation reserves associated with the liquidation of Reliance Insurance Company. Reliance was Arkansas Best's excess insurer for the years 1993 through 1999. For claims not accepted by state guaranty funds, Arkansas Best has continually maintained reserves for its exposure to the Reliance liquidation since 2001. However, during this year's second quarter, Arkansas Best began receiving notices of rejection from the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CAIGA) on certain claims previously accepted by this guaranty fund. If these claims are not covered by the CAIGA fund, they become part of Arkansas Best's exposure to the Reliance liquidation. An after-tax charge of $1.6 million ($0.06 per diluted common share) to increase the reserves for this additional exposure was recorded in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Common Stock Purchase
     During the second quarter of 2004, Arkansas Best made open-market purchases, totaling 140,100 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $3.7 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since February 2003, as a part of a previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, Arkansas Best has purchased a total of 471,500 shares totaling $12.4 million. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2004 second quarter results. The call will be today, Tuesday, July 20, at 10:00 a.m. EDT. Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257. Following the call, a recorded playback will be available through the end of July. To listen to the playback, dial (800) 642-1687.

Further, the Committee shall make all other determinations that may be necessary for the administration of the Plan. To the extent permitted by Section 162(m) and its regulations, the Committee may, from time-to-time, delegate some or all of its authority hereunder.

No later than ninety (90) days after the end of each Plan Year, the Committee shall identify and certify each Employee who is an Executive Officer for the Plan Year just ended.

No later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of each Plan Year, the Committee shall select performance measures and shall establish in writing performance goals for that Plan Year. Except as provided in Section 5.7 herein, performance measures which may serve as determinants of Executive Officers' Individual Award Opportunities shall be limited to the Company's pretax income, net income, earnings per share, revenues, expenses, return on assets, return on equity, return on capital employed, return on investment, net profit margin, operating profit margin, operating cash flow, total shareholder return, capitalization, liquidity, results of customer satisfaction surveys and safety or productivity improvement.

Each range may include levels of performance above and below the one hundred percent (100%) performance level at which a greater or lesser percent of the Target Incentive Award may be earned.
In establishing or adjusting a performance goal, the Committee may exclude the impact of any of the following events or occurrences which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded: (a) any amounts accrued by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to management bonus plans or cash profit sharing plans and related employer payroll taxes for the fiscal year; (b) any discretionary or matching contributions made to the savings and deferred profit-sharing plan or deferred compensation plan for the fiscal year; (c) asset write-downs, (d) litigation, claims, judgments or settlements, (e) the effect of changes in tax law or other such laws or regulations affecting reported results, (f) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs, (g) any extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30, (h) any change in accounting principle as defined in APB No. 20 and (i) any loss from a discontinued operation as described in Financial Accounting Standards No. 144.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, and only to the extent it would not eliminate the ability of the Individual Award Opportunities held by Executive Officers to qualify for the "performance based compensation" exception under Code Section 162(m), in the event of any change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as any merger, consolidation, separation, spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Company, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Code Section 368), or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such adjustment may be made in the Individual Award Opportunities and/or the performance measures or performance goals related to then-current performance periods, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
5.2 INDIVIDUAL AWARD OPPORTUNITIES. No later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of each Plan Year, the Committee shall establish, in writing, Individual Award Opportunities which correspond to various levels of achievement of the pre-established performance goals. The established Individual Award Opportunities may vary in relation to the job classification of each Participant or among Participants in the same job classification and be established as a function of each Executive Officer's Base Salary or such other criteria as the Committee may select. In the event an Executive Officer changes job levels during a Plan Year, the Participant's Individual Award Opportunity may be adjusted to reflect the amount of time at each job level during the Plan Year.
5.3 COMPUTATION OF FINAL AWARDS. Each Executive Officer's Final Award shall be based on: (a) the Executive Officer's Target Incentive Award; (b) the potential Final Awards corresponding to various levels of achievement of the pre-established performance goals, as established by the Committee; and (c) Company or Subsidiary performance in relation to the pre-established performance goals.
5.4 FINAL AWARD LIMIT. The Committee may establish guidelines governing the maximum Final Awards that may be earned by Executive Officers (either in the aggregate, by Employee class, or among individual Executive Officers) in each Plan Year. The guidelines may be expressed as a percentage of companywide goals of financial measures, or such other measures as the Committee shall from time to time determine; provided, however, that the maximum payout with respect to a Final Award payable to any one Executive Officer in connection with performance in any one Plan Year shall not exceed $2,000,000.
 
5.5 NO MID-YEAR CHANGE IN AWARD OPPORTUNITIES. Except as provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.7 herein, each Executive Officer's Final Award shall be based exclusively on the Individual Award Opportunity levels established by the Committee pursuant to Section 5.2 above.
5.6 NONADJUSTMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE GOALS. Except as provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.7, performance goals shall not be changed following their establishment, and Executive Officers shall not receive any payout under this Plan when the minimum performance goals are not met or exceeded. Following the completion of each Plan Year, if the performance goals were met, the Committee shall certify in writing prior to payment of Final Awards that the corresponding performance goals for such Plan Year were satisfied.
5.7 POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS. If, on the advice of the Company's counsel, the Committee determines that Code Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder will not adversely affect the deductibility for federal income tax purposes of any amount paid under the Plan by permitting greater discretion and/or flexibility with respect to performance measures, performance goals, or Individual Award Opportunities granted to Executive Officers, then the Committee may, in its sole discretion, apply such greater discretion and/or flexibility to such performance measures, performance goals or Individual Award Opportunities as is consistent with such advice and the terms of this Plan. In addition, in the event that changes are made to Code Section 162(m) or the regulations thereunder to permit greater flexibility with respect to any Individual Award Opportunities under the Plan, the Committee may exercise such greater flexibility consistent with the terms of the Plan and to the extent of such changes.
6.1 FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENT. Unless a deferral election is made by an Executive Officer pursuant to Section 6.2 herein, or deferral of all or a portion of an Executive Officer's Final Award is required by Section 6.3, each Executive Officer's Final Award shall be earned and paid in cash, in one lump sum, as soon as the Final Award's calculation is completed and the written certification of the Committee in Section 5.6 hereof has been issued. Except as provided in Section 7, an Executive Officer must be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on the date of payment to receive a Final Award.
6.2 VOLUNTARY DEFERRAL OF FINAL AWARD PAYOUTS. An Executive Officer may defer receipt of some or all payments otherwise due under the Plan pursuant to the terms of the Company's Voluntary Savings Plan ("VSP").
6.3 DEFERRAL OF FINAL AWARD PAYOUTS. In the event that all or a portion of an Executive Officer's Final Award is not deductible by the Company due to limits contained in Code Section 162(m) or any successor Code Section, the Committee shall require that payment of the nondeductible portion of such Final Award shall be deferred until the earlier of the Executive Officer's death, disability, a Change in Control, or 185 days after termination of employment. The Committee, in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Sections 162(m) and the regulations thereunder, shall determine rates of interest on such deferred amounts.
6.4 UNSECURED INTEREST. No Executive Officer or any other party claiming an interest in amounts earned under the Plan shall have any interest whatsoever in any specific asset of the Company or any Subsidiary. To the extent that any party acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, such right shall be equivalent to that of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
7.1 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENTIn the event an Executive Officer's employment is terminated by reason of death, Disability, or Retirement, the Final Award is to be paid as soon as its calculation is completed and the written certification of the Committee in Section 5.6 hereof has been issued following the end of the Plan Year in which employment termination occurs. In the case of an Executive Officer's Disability, the employment termination shall be deemed to have occurred on the date that the Committee determines the definition of Disability to have been satisfied. An Executive Officer must have been a Participant in the Plan during the Plan Year for not less than the ninety (90) days prior to his Retirement.
.
 
7.2 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR OTHER REASONS. In the event an Executive Officer's employment is terminated for any reason other than death, Disability, or Retirement (of which the Committee shall be the sole judge), the Executive Officer's opportunity to receive a Final Award shall be forfeited. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay a prorated award for the portion of the Plan Year that the Executive Officer was employed by the Company, computed as determined by the Committee.
8.1 EMPLOYMENT. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Executive Officer's or other Employee's employment at any time, nor confer upon any Executive Officer or other Employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company.
8.2 NONTRANSFERABILITY. No right or interest of any Executive Officer or other Employee in the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to any lien, directly, by operation of law or otherwise, including, but not limited to, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, and bankruptcy.
Each Executive Officer may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Executive Officer, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed by the Executive Officer in writing with the Committee during his or her lifetime. Beneficiary designations filed with respect to predecessor plans prior to the adoption of this Plan shall be effective with respect to this Plan. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Executive Officer's death shall be paid to the Executive Officer's estate.
In the event of a Change in Control, each Executive Officer shall receive a pro rata payment of the greater of his or her Target Incentive Award or Final Award for the Plan Year during which such Change in Control occurs. In such circumstances, the Committee shall determine the Final Award based upon performance during the Plan Year until the date of the Change in Control and shall determine the Executive Officer's base salary as of a date on or before the Change in Control. Such proration shall be determined as a function of the number of days within the Plan Year prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, in relation to three hundred sixty-five (365). Such amount shall be paid in cash to each Executive Officer as soon as the final calculation is completed, but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if any of the payments provided for in this Plan, together with any other payments which Executive Officer has the right to receive from the Company, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)), the payments pursuant to this Plan and/or other plans or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount and/or paid at such time as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999.
The Committee, or the Board, may at any time and without notice, modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, or suspend or terminate it entirely; provided, however, that no such modification, amendment, suspension, or termination may, without the consent of an Executive Officer (or his or her beneficiary in the case of the death of the Executive Officer), reduce the right of an Executive Officer to a payment or distribution hereunder to which he or she is entitled at the time such actions are taken. Provided, further, that certain material amendments to the Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval pursuant to Code Section 162(m).
 
12.1 GOVERNING LAW. The Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Arkansas, and shall be construed in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) of the Code.
12.2 WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company shall have the right to deduct from all payments under the Plan any foreign, federal, state, or local income or other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payments. Before payment of any Final Award may be deferred under Section 6, the Company may require that the Executive Officer pay or agree to withholding for any foreign, federal, state or local income or other taxes which may be imposed on any amount deferred.
12.3 SEVERABILITY. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
12.4 SUCCESSORS. All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
12.5 SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. No Final Award shall be paid to any Executive Officer unless and until the material terms of the Plan have been approved by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with Code Section 162(m).
12.6 APPLICABILITY OF PLAN. The provisions of this Plan shall apply only to Executive Officers. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Plan and the provisions of any other bonus or incentive plan that might pertain to Executive Officers, the provisions of this Plan shall control.

Powers of Committee
     (d) . All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Committee related to the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of or operation of any Award granted hereunder, will be final and binding on all Participants, beneficiaries, heirs, assigns or other persons holding or claiming rights under the Plan or any Award. The Committee will consider those factors as it deems relevant, in its sole and absolute discretion, to making any decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or other employee of the Company and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select.
Determinations by the Committee
     (e) . In the case of a grant of an Award to any Participant employed by a Subsidiary, the Company may implement such a grant, if the Committee so directs, by issuing any subject shares to the Subsidiary, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may determine, upon the condition or understanding that the Subsidiary will transfer the shares to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Subsidiary may issue the Award by and in its name and the Award will be deemed granted on the date determined by the Committee.

Effective Date and Termination of Plan
The Company's Board adopted this Plan as of February 24, 2005. The Plan will become effective (the "") when the Company's stockholders approve it.

Shares Subject to the Plan and to Awards
     (a) . The maximum aggregate number of Shares issuable pursuant to all Awards is 1,500,000, plus any shares subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans as of the Effective Date that become available pursuant to Section 6(b). The aggregate number of Shares available for grant under this Plan and the number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards will be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13. The Shares issued pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or shares that the Company reacquired, including shares purchased in the open market.
Aggregate Limits
 
     (b) . For purposes of Section 6(a), the aggregate number of Shares issued under this Plan at any time equals only the number of Shares actually issued upon exercise or settlement of an Award. Shares (i) subject to Awards that are canceled, expired, forfeited or settled in cash and (ii) that are delivered or deemed delivered to the Company in payment or satisfaction of the exercise price or tax withholding obligation of an Award will again be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan. In addition, shares subject to awards made under any of the Prior Plans (i) that do not result in the issuance of Shares as a result of the awards having been canceled, expired, forfeited or settled in cash or (ii) that are delivered or deemed delivered to the Company in payment or satisfaction of the exercise price or tax withholding obligations of an award under a Prior Plan will be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan.
Issuance of Shares
     (c) . The maximum aggregate number of Shares issuable under all Awards granted under this Plan during any calendar year to any one Participant is 100,000, which number will be calculated and adjusted pursuant to Section 13 only to the extent that such calculation or adjustment will not affect the status of any Award intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. The maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan is 1,500,000, which number will be calculated and adjusted pursuant to Section 13 only to the extent that such calculation or adjustment will not affect the status of any option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. For that portion of a Performance Award Unit granted under this Plan in any calendar year to any Participant that is denominated in dollars (as opposed to Shares) and is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum amount payable for the performance period is $2 million times the number of years in the performance period.

Options
     (a) . The Committee may grant Options to Participants at any time prior to the termination of the Plan. No Participant will have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to Options until said Shares have been issued. Each Option will be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Options granted pursuant to the Plan may be different but each Option must contain and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.
Option Awards
     (b) . The Committee will establish the exercise price per Share of each Option, which, in no event will the purchase price be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant; provided, however, that the exercise price per Share with respect to an Option that is granted in connection with a merger or other acquisition as a substitute or replacement award for options held by optionees of the acquired entity may be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date such Option is granted if based on a formula set forth in the terms of the options held by such optionees or in the terms of the agreement providing for such merger or other acquisition. The exercise price of any Option may be paid in cash or, to the extent allowed by the Committee, an irrevocable commitment by a broker to pay over such amount from a sale of the Shares issuable under an Option, the delivery of previously owned Shares, withholding of Shares deliverable upon exercise or a combination thereof.
Price
     (c) . Other than in connection with a change in the Company's capitalization (as described in Section 13) the exercise price of an Option may not be reduced without shareholder approval (including canceling previously awarded Options and regranting them with a lower exercise price).
No Repricing
     (d) . In no event may any Option become exercisable sooner than one (1) year after the date of grant except to the extent provided by the Committee in the event of the Participant's death, disability or Retirement or a Change in Control. Unless provided otherwise in the applicable Award Agreement, the vesting period and/or exercisability of an Option will be adjusted by the Committee during or to reflect the effects of any period during which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full-time basis. Each Option will expire within a period of not more than ten (10) years from the date of grant.
Provisions Applicable to Options
     (e) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, in the case of the grant of an Option intending to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option: (i) if the Participant owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company (a ""), the purchase price of the Option must be at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant and the Option must expire within a period of not more than five (5) years from the date of grant, and
Incentive Stock Options
10% Shareholder
(ii) termination of employment will occur when the person to whom an Award was granted ceases to be an employee
 
(as determined in accordance with Section 3401(c) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary, options designated as Incentive Stock Options will be ineligible for treatment under the Code as Incentive Stock Options (and will be deemed to be Nonqualified Stock Options) to the extent that (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted, or (ii) such Options otherwise remain exercisable but are not exercised within three (3) months after termination of employment (or such other period of time provided in Section 422 of the Code).
8.
Stock Appreciation Rights
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants either in tandem with or as a component of other Awards granted under the Plan ("") or not in conjunction with other Awards ("") and may, but need not, relate to a specific Option granted under Section 7. The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights do not need to be the same with respect to each grant or each recipient. Any Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be granted at the same time such Option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Option. All Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan will be granted subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Options as set forth in Section 7; provided, however, that Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with a previously granted Option will have the terms and conditions of such Option. Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the Committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any Stock Appreciation Right as it deems appropriate. Stock Appreciation Rights may be settled in Shares, cash or a combination of both. Other than in connection with a change in the Company's capitalization (as described in Section 13), the exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right may not be reduced without stockholder approval (including canceling previously awarded Stock Appreciation Rights and regranting them with a lower exercise price). Each Stock Appreciation Right will be evidenced by an Award Agreement.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
     (a) . Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be granted at any time before the termination of the Plan to Participants selected by the Committee. Restricted Stock is an award or issuance of Shares the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject during specified periods of time to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms as the Committee deems appropriate. Restricted Stock Units are Awards denominated in units of Shares under which the issuance of Shares is subject to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms, as the Committee deems appropriate. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, each Restricted Stock Unit will be equal to one Share. To the extent determined by the Committee, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be satisfied or settled in Shares, cash or a combination thereof. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan do not need to be identical, but each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units must contain and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
     (b) . Each Award Agreement will contain provisions regarding (i) the number of Shares or Restricted Stock Units subject to such Award or a formula for determining such number, (ii) the purchase price of the Shares, if any, and the means of payment, (iii) the performance criteria, if any, and level of achievement versus these criteria that will determine the number of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted, issued, retainable and/or vested, (iv) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting and/or forfeiture of the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units as may be determined by the Committee, (v) the term of the performance period, if any, as to which performance will be measured for determining the number of such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, (vi) restrictions on the transferability of the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, and (vii) such further terms and conditions in each case not inconsistent with this Plan as may be determined by the Committee. Shares issued under a Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award may be issued in the name of the Participant and held by the Participant or held by the Company, in each case as the Committee may provide.
Contents of Award Agreement
 
     (c) . The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will occur when and in such installments as the Committee determines or under criteria the Committee establishes, which may include Qualifying Performance Criteria. The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of Shares under any such Award that is based on performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria will be subject to a performance period of not less than one (1) year, and the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of Shares under any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is based upon continued employment or the passage of time may not vest or be settled in full over a period of less than three (3) years, except that the Committee may provide for the satisfaction and/or lapse of all conditions under any such Award in the event of the Participant's death, disability, Retirement or in connection with a Change in Control, and the Committee may provide that any such restriction or limitation will not apply in the case of a Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is issued in payment or settlement of compensation that has been earned by the Participant. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the performance criteria for any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code will be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified when the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit is granted.
Vesting and Performance Criteria
     (d) . Subject to the limits imposed under Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards that are intended to qualify as "performance based compensation," notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the Committee, to the extent specified in the Award Agreement, may reduce the number of Shares granted, issued, retainable and/or vested under an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee will determine.
Discretionary Adjustments and Limits
     (e) . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Plan may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares during the period of restriction. Participants will have no voting rights with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares are reflected as issued and outstanding shares on the Company's stock ledger.
Voting Rights
     (f) . Participants in whose name Restricted Stock is granted will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those shares, unless determined otherwise by the Committee. The Committee will determine whether any such dividends or distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional Shares of Restricted Stock and subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the Restricted Stock with respect to which they were distributed or whether such dividends or distributions will be paid in cash. Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units will be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents only to the extent provided by the Committee.

Performance Award Units
     (a) . Each Performance Award Unit Award will confer upon the Participant the opportunity to earn a future payment tied to the level of achievement with respect to the performance criteria established for a performance period established by the Committee.

General
     (b) . The terms of any Performance Award Unit will be set forth in an Award Agreement. Each Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award Unit will contain provisions about (i) the target and maximum amount payable to the Participant as a Performance Award Unit, (ii) the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria that will determine the amount of such payment, (iii) the term of the performance period as to which performance will be measured for determining the amount of any payment, (iv) the timing of any payment earned by virtue of performance, (v) restrictions on the alienation or transfer of the Performance Award Unit before actual payment, (vi) forfeiture provisions and (vii) such further terms and conditions, in each case consistent with this Plan as the Committee may periodically determine.

The Committee will establish the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria that will determine the target and maximum amount payable under a Performance Award Unit, which criteria may be based on financial performance and/or personal performance evaluations. The Committee may specify the percentage of the target Performance Award Unit that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any portion of a Performance Award Unit that is intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code will be a measure
Performance Criteria
 
based on the Qualifying Performance Criteria the Committee selects and specifies when the Performance Award Unit is granted.

Discretionary Adjustments
11.
Deferral of Gains
The Committee may, in an Award Agreement or otherwise, provide for the deferred delivery of Shares upon settlement, vesting or other events with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or in payment or satisfaction of a Performance Award Unit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will any deferral of the delivery of Shares or any other payment with respect to any Award be allowed if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the deferral would result in the imposition of the additional tax under Section 409A(1)(B) of the Code.
12.
Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Awards
The Committee may provide that the Shares issued upon exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise subject to or issued under an Award will be subject to such further agreements, restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Committee in its discretion may specify before the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the grant, vesting or settlement of such Award, including, without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the shares issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award (including the actual or constructive surrender of Shares already owned by the Participant) or payment of taxes arising in connection with an Award. Without limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued under an Award, including, without limitation, (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, and (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers.
13.
Adjustment of and Changes in the Stock
     (a) In the event that the number of Shares increases or decreases through a reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, dividend (other than regular, quarterly cash dividends), or otherwise, then the Committee may appropriately adjust each Share that has been authorized for issuance under the Plan, whether such Share is then currently subject to or may become subject to an Award under the Plan, as well as the per share limits set forth in Section 6 to reflect such increase or decrease, unless the Company provides otherwise under the terms of such transaction. The Committee may also adjust the terms of any outstanding Award as to price, number of Shares subject to such Award and other terms to reflect the foregoing events.
     (b) In the event of any other change in the number or kind of outstanding Shares, or any stock or other securities into which such Shares have been changed, or for which Shares have been exchanged, whether by reason of a Change in Control, other merger, consolidation or otherwise, then the Committee will, in its sole discretion, determine the appropriate adjustment, if any, to be effected. In addition, in the event of a change described in this paragraph, the Committee may accelerate the time or times at which any Award may be exercised and may provide for cancellation of such accelerated Awards that are not exercised within a time prescribed by the Committee in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any adjustment to Options granted pursuant to this Plan intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options must comply with the requirements, provisions and restrictions of the Code.
 
     (c) No right to purchase fractional shares will result from any adjustment in Awards pursuant to this Section 13. In case of any such adjustment, the shares subject to the Award will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Company will give notice of any adjustment made to each Participant, and such adjustment (whether or not notice is given) will be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
14.
Qualifying Performance-Based Compensation
     (a) . The Committee may specify a percentage of an Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, provided that the performance criteria for any portion of an Award that is intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code will be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified at the time the Award is granted. The Committee will certify the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria has been satisfied, and the amount payable as a result thereof, prior to payment, settlement or vesting of any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of Shares issued or the amount paid under an Award intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code may, to the extent specified in the Award Agreement, be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion determines.

Suspension or Termination of Awards
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, if at any time (including after a notice of exercise has been delivered or an Award has vested) the Chief Executive Officer or any other person designated by the Committee (each such person, an "") reasonably believes that a Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct as described in this Section 16, the Authorized Officer, Committee or Board of Directors may suspend the Participant's rights to exercise any Option, to vest in an Award, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of an Award pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed.
Authorized Officer

Act of Misconduct
17.
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
The grant, issuance, vesting, exercise and settlement of Awards under this Plan, and the obligation of the Company to sell, issue or deliver shares of such Awards, will be subject to all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, stock exchange rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company will not be required to register in a Participant's name or deliver any shares before the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any foreign, federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body, which the Committee will determine to be necessary or advisable. To the extent the Company is unable to or the Committee deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such shares absent such requisite authority. No Option will be exercisable and no shares will be issued and/or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the shares underlying such Stock Option or other Award is effective and current or the Company has determined that such registration is unnecessary. In the event that the Committee determines that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares in respect of an Award pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for a cash payment to the holder of the Award in settlement thereof in lieu of the issuance of shares under the Award.
If an Award is granted to or held by a Participant employed or providing services outside the United States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the provisions of the Plan or of such Award as they pertain to such individual to comply with applicable foreign law or to recognize differences in local law, currency or tax policy. The Committee may also impose conditions on the grant, issuance, exercise, vesting, settlement or retention of Awards to comply with such foreign law and/or to minimize the Company's obligations with respect to tax equalization for Participants employed outside their home country.
 
18.
Withholding
To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, a Participant must satisfy, in a manner satisfactory to the Company, any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an Option exercise, disposition of shares issued under an Incentive Stock Option, the vesting of or settlement of Shares or deferred units under an Award, an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code or otherwise with respect to an Award. The Company and its Subsidiaries will not be required to issue Shares, make any payment or to recognize the transfer or disposition of shares until the Participant satisfies such obligations. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to the Participant upon exercise of the Option or the vesting or settlement of an Award, or by tendering shares previously acquired.
19.
Amendment of the Plan or Awards
The Board may amend, alter or discontinue this Plan and the Committee may amend, or alter any agreement or other document evidencing an Award made under this Plan but, except as provided pursuant to the provisions of Section 13, no such amendment will, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company:
     (a) increase the maximum number of shares for which Awards may be granted under this Plan;
     (b) reduce the price at which Options may be granted below the price provided for in Section 7(b);
     (c) reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options;
     (d) extend the term of this Plan;
     (e) change the class of persons eligible to be Participants;
     (f) otherwise amend the Plan in any manner requiring stockholder approval by law or under the NASDAQ National Market listing requirements; or
     (g) increase the individual maximum limits in Section 6(c).
No amendment or alteration to the Plan or an Award or Award Agreement will be made which would impair the rights of the holder of an Award, without such holder's consent, provided that no such consent will be required if the Committee determines in its sole discretion and before the date of any Change in Control that such amendment or alteration either is required or advisable in order for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy any law or regulation.
20.
No Liability of Company
The Company and any Subsidiary or affiliate which is in existence or hereafter comes into existence will not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance or sale of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder; and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.
21.
Non-Exclusivity of Plan
Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval will be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of restricted stock or stock options otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
22.
Governing Law
This Plan and any agreements or other documents hereunder will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable federal law. Any reference in this Plan or in the agreement or other document evidencing any Awards to a provision of law or to a rule or regulation will be deemed to include any successor law, rule or regulation of similar effect or applicability.
23.
Arbitration of Disputes
If a Participant or other holder of an Award or person claiming a right under an Award or the Plan wishes to challenge any action of the Committee, a subcommittee or the Plan Administrator, the person may do so only by submitting to binding arbitration with respect to such decision. The review by the arbitrator will be limited to determining whether the Participant or other Award holder has proven that the Committee's decision was arbitrary or capricious.

     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 3, the Award shall be subject to earlier acceleration of vesting and/or forfeiture and transfer as provided in this Agreement and the Plan.
     From and after the Grant Date, Participant will be recorded as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Shares subject to the Award (whether vested or unvested) and shall have voting rights with respect to such Shares unless and until any such Shares are forfeited or transferred back to the Company.
     From and after the Grant Date and unless and until the Shares are forfeited or otherwise transferred back to the Company, the Participant will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Shares subject to this Award. Dividends payable by the Company to its public stockholders in cash shall, with respect to any Unvested Shares, be paid in cash on or about the date such dividends are payable to public stockholders, subject to any applicable tax withholding requirements.
     (a) . Except as provided in Paragraphs 6(b), (c) or (d), upon a termination of Participant's service as a member of the Board for any reason, the Unvested Shares shall be forfeited by Participant and cancelled and surrendered to the Company without payment of any consideration to Participant.
General
     (b) . Upon a termination of Participant's service as a member of the Board by reason of Participant's death, Disability or Retirement (as defined below), all Unvested Shares shall vest as of the date of such termination of service. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "" shall mean a condition under which Participant either (A) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, or (B) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company.

Early Retirement
     (d) . All Unvested Shares shall vest as of the date a Change in Control occurs.
Change in Control
     Under Section 83(a) of the Code, Participant will be taxed on the Shares subject to this Award on the date such Shares vest and the forfeiture restrictions lapse as set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement, based on their fair market value on such date, at ordinary income rates subject to payroll and withholding tax and tax reporting, as applicable. For this purpose, the term "forfeiture restrictions" means the right of the Company to receive back any Unvested Shares upon a termination of service as a member of the Board. Under Section 83(b) of the Code, Participant may elect to be taxed on the Shares on the Grant Date, based upon their fair market value on such date, at ordinary income rates subject to tax payments and tax reporting as applicable at that time, rather than when and as the Unvested Shares cease to be subject to the forfeiture restrictions. If Participant elects to accelerate the date on which he or she is taxed on the Shares under Section 83(b), an election (an "") to such effect must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the Grant Date of the Award and applicable taxes must be timely paid to the IRS.
83(b) Election
     There are significant risks associated with the decision to make an 83(b) Election. If the Participant makes an 83(b) Election and the Unvested Shares are subsequently forfeited to the Company, the Participant will not be entitled to recover the taxes paid by claiming a deduction for the ordinary income previously recognized as a result of the 83(b) Election. If the Participant makes an 83(b) Election and the value of the Unvested Shares subsequently declines, the 83(b) Election may cause the Participant to recognize more compensation income than otherwise would have been the case. On the other hand, if the value of the Unvested Shares increases and the Participant has not made an 83(b) Election, Participant may recognize more compensation income than otherwise would have been the case.
     The foregoing is only a summary of the federal income tax laws that apply to the Shares under this Agreement and does not purport to be complete. The actual tax consequences of receiving or disposing of the Shares are complicated and depend, in part, on the Participant's specific situation and may also depend on the resolution of currently uncertain tax law and other variables not within the control of the Company.
THEREFORE, THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE REGARDING THE APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX LAW AND THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE OR FOREIGN COUNTRY TO WHICH THE
 
By accepting this Agreement, Participant acknowledges and agrees that he or she has either consulted with a competent tax advisor independent of the Company to obtain tax advice concerning the Shares in light of the Participant's specific situation or has had the opportunity to consult with such a tax advisor and has chosen not to do so.
PARTICIPANT IS SUBJECT.
     If the Participant determines to make an 83(b) Election, it is the Participant's responsibility to file such an election with the Internal Revenue Service within the 30 day period after the Grant Date, to deliver to the Company a of the 83(b) Election, to file an additional of such election form with the Participant's federal income tax return for the calendar year in which the Grant Date occurs, and to timely pay the applicable taxes due in connection with such election.

     The Company may at its election either (a) after the Grant Date, issue a certificate representing the Shares subject to the Award and place a legend on and stop transfer notice describing the restrictions on and forfeitability of such Shares, in which case the Company may retain such certificates unless and until the Shares represented by such certificate have vested and may cancel such certificate if and to the extent that the Shares are forfeited or otherwise required to be transferred back to the Company, or (b) not issue any certificate representing Shares subject to this Agreement and instead document Participant's interest in the Shares by registering the Shares with the Company's transfer agent (or another custodian selected by the Company) in book entry form in Participant's name with the applicable restrictions noted in the book entry system, in which case no certificate(s) representing all or a part of the Shares will be issued unless and until the Shares become Vested Shares. The Company may provide a reasonable delay in the issuance or delivery of Vested Shares as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters.
     The Company will not be required to (a) transfer on its books any Shares subject to the Award that have been sold or transferred in violation of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) treat as the owner of the Shares subject to the Award, or otherwise accord voting, dividend or liquidation rights to, any transferee to whom such Shares have been transferred in contravention of this Agreement.
          (i)
 
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments in respect of this Award, together with any other payments to which Participant has the right to receive from the Company or any purchaser, successor, or assign, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)), the payments pursuant to the Award and/or such other plans or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999.
     The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, as it exists on the Grant Date and as the Plan is amended from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement. The term "Section" generally refers to provisions within the Plan; provided, however, the term "Paragraph" shall refer to a provision of this Agreement.
     By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges that: (a) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary and (b) the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment or Board member relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company shall be under no obligation whatsoever to advise Participant of the existence, maturity or termination of any of Participant's rights hereunder and Participant shall be responsible for familiarizing himself or herself with all matters contained herein and in the Plan which may affect any of Participant's rights or privileges hereunder.
     Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or the Plan, any adjustments required to be made under the Plan, and any controversy that may arise under the Plan or this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee (including any Subcommittee or other person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding.
     Any sale, transfer, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, conveyance in trust, gift, transfer by bequest, devise or descent, or other transfer or disposition of any kind, whether voluntary or by operation of law, directly or indirectly, of Unvested Shares shall be strictly prohibited and void; provided, however, Participant may assign or transfer the Award to the extent permitted under the Plan, provided that the Award shall be subject to all the terms and condition of the Plan, this Agreement and any other terms required by the Committee as a condition to such transfer.
 
     Pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if at any time prior to Participant's receipt of Shares pursuant to the Award an Authorized Officer reasonably believes that Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct (as defined below), the Authorized Officer, the Committee or the Board may suspend Participant's rights to vest in any shares of Restricted Stock, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of Vested Shares pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed. In addition, pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if the Committee or an Authorized Officer determines Participant has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Company or any Subsidiary, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Company ethics policy or code of conduct, deliberate disregard of Company or Subsidiary rules, or if Participant makes an unauthorized disclosure of any Company or Subsidiary trade secret or confidential information, solicits any employee or service provider to leave the employ or cease providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary, breaches any intellectual property or assignment of inventions covenant, engages in any conduct constituting unfair competition, breaches any non-competition agreement, induces any Company or Subsidiary customer to breach a contract with the Company or any Subsidiary or to cease doing business with the Company or any Subsidiary, or induces any principal for whom the Company or any Subsidiary acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship (any of the foregoing acts, an ""), then except as otherwise provided by the Committee, (i) neither Participant nor Participant's estate nor transferee will be entitled to vest in or have the restrictions on Unvested Shares lapse, or otherwise receive payment or Shares under in respect of Vested Shares and (ii) Participant will forfeit all undelivered (including deferred) Vested and Unvested Shares. In making such determination, the Committee or an Authorized Officer shall give Participant an opportunity to appear and present evidence on his or her behalf at a hearing before the Committee or an opportunity to submit written comments, documents, information and arguments to be considered by the Committee. Any dispute by Participant or other person as to the determination of the Committee must be resolved pursuant to Paragraph 17(j).

Any notice given by the Company to Participant directed to Participant at Participant's address on file with the Company shall be effective to bind Participant and any other person who shall have acquired rights under this Agreement. The Company or Participant may change, by written notice to the other, the address previously specified for receiving notices.

     (b) . No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing and signed by the person against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced, nor will failure to enforce any right hereunder constitute a continuing waiver of the same or a waiver of any other right hereunder.
No Waiver

Change in Control
Cause
Good Reason
     Under Section 83(a) of the Code, Participant will be taxed on the Shares subject to this Award on the date such Shares vest and the forfeiture restrictions lapse as set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement, based on their fair market value on such date, at ordinary income rates subject to payroll and withholding tax and tax reporting, as applicable. For this purpose, the term "forfeiture restrictions" means the right of the Company to receive back any Unvested Shares upon a termination of employment. Under Section 83(b) of the Code, Participant may elect to be taxed on the Shares on the Grant Date, based upon their fair market value on such date, at ordinary income rates subject to payroll and withholding tax and tax reporting, rather than when and as the Unvested Shares cease to be subject to the forfeiture restrictions. If Participant elects to accelerate the date on which he or she is taxed on the Shares under Section 83(b), an election (an "") to such effect must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the Grant Date of the Award and applicable withholding taxes must be paid to the Company at that time.
83(b) Election
     There are significant risks associated with the decision to make an 83(b) Election. If the Participant makes an 83(b) Election and the Unvested Shares are subsequently forfeited to the
 
Company, the Participant will not be entitled to recover the taxes paid by claiming a deduction for the ordinary income previously recognized as a result of the 83(b) Election. If the Participant makes an 83(b) Election and the value of the Unvested Shares subsequently declines, the 83(b) Election may cause the Participant to recognize more compensation income than otherwise would have been the case. On the other hand, if the value of the Unvested Shares increases and the Participant has not made an 83(b) Election, Participant may recognize more compensation income than otherwise would have been the case.
     The foregoing is only a summary of the federal income tax laws that apply to the Shares under this Agreement and does not purport to be complete. The actual tax consequences of receiving or disposing of the Shares are complicated and depend, in part, on the Participant's specific situation and may also depend on the resolution of currently uncertain tax law and other variables not within the control of the Company. By accepting this Agreement, Participant acknowledges and agrees that he or she has either consulted with a competent tax advisor independent of the Company to obtain tax advice concerning the Shares in light of the Participant's specific situation or has had the opportunity to consult with such a tax advisor and has chosen not to do so.
THEREFORE, THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE REGARDING THE APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX LAW AND THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE OR FOREIGN COUNTRY TO WHICH THE PARTICIPANT IS SUBJECT.
     If the Participant determines to make an 83(b) Election, it is the Participant's responsibility to file such an election with the Internal Revenue Service within the 30 day period after the Grant Date, to deliver to the Company a of the 83(b) Election, to file an additional of such election form with the Participant's federal income tax return for the calendar year in which the Grant Date occurs, and to pay applicable withholding taxes to the Company at the time that the 83(b) Election is filed with the IRS.

     The Company will not be required to (a) transfer on its books any Shares subject to the Award that have been sold or transferred in violation of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) treat as the owner of the Shares subject to the Award, or otherwise accord voting, dividend or liquidation rights to, any transferee to whom such Shares have been transferred in contravention of this Agreement.

The Company does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Award. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
Generally
     (b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting or payment in respect of the Award) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any social tax obligation (the ""), Participant is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company.
Payment of Withholding Taxes
Tax Withholding Obligation
          (i) . Unless Participant elects to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by an alternative means in accordance with Paragraph 10(b)(ii), Participant's acceptance of this Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company to withhold on Participant's behalf the number of Shares from those Shares issuable to Participant at the time when the Award becomes vested as the Company determines to be sufficient to satisfy the minimum statutory Tax Withholding Obligation.
By Withholding Shares
          (ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a Vesting Date or 83(b) Election date), , Participant may notify the Company of Participant's election to pay Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by wire transfer, cashier's check or other means permitted by the Company. In such case, Participant shall satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation by paying to the Company on such date as it shall specify an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the expected Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a cashier's check payable to the Company, Attn: General Counsel, at the address set forth in Paragraph 17(a), or such other address as the Company may from time to time direct, or (iii) such other means as the Company may establish or permit. Participant agrees and acknowledges that prior to the date the Tax Withholding Obligation arises, the Company will be required to estimate the amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation and accordingly may require the amount paid to the Company under this Paragraph 10(b)(ii) to be more than the minimum amount that may actually be due and that, if Participant has not delivered payment of a sufficient amount to the Company to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation (regardless of
By Other Payment
 
whether as a result of the Company underestimating the required payment or Participant failing to timely make the required payment), the additional Tax Withholding Obligation amounts shall be satisfied in the manner specified in Paragraph 10(b)(i).
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments in respect of this Award, together with any other payments to which Participant has the right to receive from the Company or any purchaser, successor, or assign, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)), the payments pursuant to the Award and/or such other plans or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999.
     The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, as it exists on the Grant Date and as the Plan is amended from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement. The term "Section" generally refers to provisions within the Plan; provided, however, the term "Paragraph" shall refer to a provision of this Agreement.
     By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges that: (a) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary; (b) the value of the Award is an extraordinary item which is outside the scope of any employment contract with Participant; (c) the Award is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without limitation for calculating any benefits, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and Participant will not be entitled to compensation or damages as a consequence of Participant's forfeiture as provided for in the Plan or this Agreement of any unvested portion of the Award as a result of Participant's Termination of Service with the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason; and (d) in the event that Participant is not a direct employee of Company, the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary and the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with Participant's employer, the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company shall be under no obligation whatsoever to advise Participant of the existence, maturity or termination of any of Participant's rights hereunder and Participant shall be responsible for familiarizing himself or herself with all matters contained herein and in the Plan which may affect any of Participant's rights or privileges hereunder.
     Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or the Plan, any adjustments required to be made under the Plan, and any controversy that may arise under the Plan or this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee (including any Subcommittee or
 
other person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding.
     Any sale, transfer, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, conveyance in trust, gift, transfer by bequest, devise or descent, or other transfer or disposition of any kind, whether voluntary or by operation of law, directly or indirectly, of Unvested Shares shall be strictly prohibited and void; provided, however, Participant may assign or transfer the Award to the extent permitted under the Plan, provided that the Award shall be subject to all the terms and condition of the Plan, this Agreement and any other terms required by the Committee as a condition to such transfer.
     Pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if at any time prior to Participant's receipt of Shares pursuant to the Award an Authorized Officer reasonably believes that Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct (as defined below), the Authorized Officer, the Committee or the Board may suspend Participant's rights to vest in any shares of Restricted Stock, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of Vested Shares pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed. In addition, pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if the Committee or an Authorized Officer determines Participant has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Company or any Subsidiary, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Company ethics policy or code of conduct, deliberate disregard of Company or Subsidiary rules, or if Participant makes an unauthorized disclosure of any Company or Subsidiary trade secret or confidential information, solicits any employee or service provider to leave the employ or cease providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary, breaches any intellectual property or assignment of inventions covenant, engages in any conduct constituting unfair competition, breaches any non-competition agreement, induces any Company or Subsidiary customer to breach a contract with the Company or any Subsidiary or to cease doing business with the Company or any Subsidiary, or induces any principal for whom the Company or any Subsidiary acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship (any of the foregoing acts, an ""), then except as otherwise provided by the Committee, (i) neither Participant nor Participant's estate nor transferee will be entitled to vest in or have the restrictions on Unvested Shares lapse, or otherwise receive payment or Shares under in respect of Vested Shares and (ii) Participant will forfeit all undelivered (including deferred) Vested and Unvested Shares. In making such determination, the Committee or an Authorized Officer shall give Participant an opportunity to appear and present evidence on his or her behalf at a hearing before the Committee or an opportunity to submit written comments, documents, information and arguments to be considered by the Committee. Any dispute by Participant or other person as to the determination of the Committee must be resolved pursuant to Paragraph 17(j).

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION'S FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS IS $0.41/SHARE, NET INCOME INCREASES 135%; ABF(R)'S OPERATING RATIO IS 95.5% (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 25, 2005) -- Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced first quarter 2005 net income of $10.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share. For the first quarter of 2004, net income was $4.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's first quarter 2005 revenue was $417.3 million compared to $374.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC.(R) ABF Freight System had first quarter 2005 revenues of $384.1 million, a per-day increase of 11.0% versus first quarter 2004 revenue of $346.1 million. First quarter 2005 operating income at ABF was $17.2 million compared to $8.7 million during the first quarter of 2004. ABF's first quarter 2005 operating ratio was 95.5% versus an operating ratio of 97.5% during the first quarter of 2004. ABF's total tonnage per day increased by 3.7% during the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period last year. This consisted of a 2.9% increase in LTL tonnage per day and a 6.7% increase in truckload tonnage per day. "Although year-over-year LTL tonnage level increases slowed throughout the quarter, ABF improved its first quarter operating ratio by two percentage points compared to last year's first quarter," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, ABF benefited from a combination of firm pricing and additional tonnage to produce improved operating margins." Through the first twenty-one days of April, average daily tonnage figures in ABF's LTL business are slightly ahead of last year. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight was $26.28, an increase of 7.2% over last year's first quarter figure of $24.52. "The LTL pricing environment remains competitive and is consistent with last year. We think overall pricing is still good," said Mr. Young. ABF's first quarter 2005 LTL weight per shipment was flat compared to the first quarter of 2004. First quarter 2005 LTL length of haul declined by 2.0% compared to the first quarter of 2004.
Decreases in length of haul cause revenue per hundredweight to decrease. First quarter 2005 LTL freight density decreased by 2.0% compared to the first quarter of 2004. Decreases in freight density cause revenue per hundredweight to increase. Billed truckload revenue per hundredweight increased by 10.7% over last year's first quarter figure. "Because of capacity constraints in the truckload industry, ABF continued to add truckload shipments at good prices and acceptable margin levels," said Mr. Young. "While maintaining its primary emphasis on service to its LTL customers, ABF will seek to add these larger shipments when they contribute to overall profitability." "ABF's first quarter 2005 city pickup and delivery productivity was the same as that of the first quarter of 2004. Yard productivity improved over last year's first quarter," said Mr. Young. "Though ABF's first quarter bills-per-hour dock productivity was below that of the same period last year, it exceeded the dock production levels of the fourth quarter of 2004 and was equal to that of the third quarter of 2004. As new dock workers added last year have become more familiar with their job activities, dock handling efficiencies have improved." CLIPPER Clipper's first quarter 2005 revenue was $23.5 million, a 12.2% increase over first quarter 2004 revenue of $20.9 million. Clipper's first quarter 2005 operating ratio was 100.1% compared to a 2004 first quarter operating ratio of 102.8%. "Clipper's results improved significantly during the first quarter which is historically the least profitable quarter of the year," said Mr. Young. "Clipper's temperature-controlled division experienced a 23.6% revenue increase and a substantial reduction in last year's first quarter operating loss due to continued success in its dedicated fleet activity and emphasis on improving the profitability of individual customer accounts," said Mr. Young. "An increase in first quarter revenue of over 80% in Clipper's brokerage division was associated with improved service by Clipper's trucking partners and an increase of available loads that would normally move on the rail. Compared to last year's first quarter, Clipper's intermodal division experienced reductions in both revenue and operating profit, primarily due to substandard service provided by the railroads." AUCTION RATE SECURITIES In early March, accounting industry guidance became available to Arkansas Best regarding the financial statement classification of auction rate securities held as temporary investments.
This information clarified that auction rate securities should be classified as investment securities instead of cash and cash equivalents. Arkansas Best invests in auction rate securities as part of its cash management strategy. Arkansas Best has historically classified these investments as cash and cash equivalents because of the short length of their interest rate reset periods (90 days or less) and because of the ability to sell them each time their interest rates are reset. In fact, these auction rate securities are liquidated when Arkansas Best has a need for cash. Arkansas Best has reclassified auction rate securities as short-term, temporary investments. As a result of this reclassification, cash flows from investing activities now include the investments and sales of auction rate securities. This reclassification has no impact on previously reported total current assets, total assets, working capital position, results of operations, or financial covenants and does not affect previously reported cash flows from operating or financing activities. Arkansas Best had $38.5 million invested in auction rate securities at December 31, 2004 and $70.6 million invested in auction rate securities at March 31, 2005. PENSION Arkansas Best's pension expense will be $10.0 million for the full year 2005. This compares to full year 2004 pension expense of $9.5 million. EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS On April 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced an amendment to the required compliance dates for the Financial Accounting Standards Board's new rule regarding the expensing of the fair value of stock options. Arkansas Best previously disclosed that in the third quarter of 2005, it would begin expensing the fair value of stock options. As a result of the April 14 SEC ruling, Arkansas Best will now begin expensing the fair value of stock options in the first quarter of 2006. The estimated negative impact, in each quarter of 2006, of prior unvested stock option grants will be approximately $0.01 per diluted common share, net of estimated tax benefits. RESTRICTED STOCK On April 20, 2005, Arkansas Best Corporation granted 178,550 shares of restricted stock under the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders on April 20, 2005. The fair value of the shares granted is Arkansas Best's closing stock price on the date of the
grant. The restricted stock grant vests at the end of a 5-year period beginning on the date of the grant. Arkansas Best will begin expensing this restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2005. The estimated negative impact of the grant will be approximately $0.01 per diluted common share, net of estimated tax benefits, per quarter through the vesting period. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE During the first quarter of 2005, Arkansas Best made open market purchases, totaling 37,650 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $1.5 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since February 2003, as a part of a previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, Arkansas Best has purchased a total of 509,150 shares totaling $13.9 million. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis. CONFERENCE CALL Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2005 first quarter results. The call will be today, Monday, April 25, at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 25, 2005, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2005 results. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 25, 2005)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2005 net income of $23.4 million, or $0.91 per diluted common share, compared to second quarter 2004 net income of $19.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's second quarter 2005 revenue was $456.7 million compared to $424.5 million in the second quarter of 2004.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had second quarter 2005 revenues of $417.5 million, a per-day increase of 6.8% over second quarter 2004 revenue of $391.0 million. Second quarter 2005 operating income at ABF was $38.1 million compared to $32.8 million during the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 16.2%. ABF's second quarter 2005 operating ratio was 90.9% versus an operating ratio of 91.6% in the second quarter of 2004. "ABF increased its revenues and improved its operating margins in the second quarter of 2005 through balanced yield improvement and cost reductions. Although we did not have the strong tonnage growth that we had in the second quarter of 2004, our operating ratio and profits were better," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
     "Several areas contributed to the improvement in ABF's second quarter operating ratio versus last year. LTL and truckload revenue yields, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by over three percent. ABF continues to emphasize the addition of profitable business and remains committed to maintaining a good balance between tonnage growth and overall profitability," said Mr. Young. "On the cost side, ABF reduced its use of rail by moving a higher percentage of freight with ABF drivers and equipment. In many of the lanes where ABF discontinued using rail, we improved transit-time reliability and reduced costs. ABF's second quarter workers' compensation costs are below last year by approximately $2.7 million for a couple of reasons. First, there are reductions in the frequency and severity of new claims. Second, in last year's second quarter, ABF incurred additional costs of approximately $1.1 million due to an increase
 
in the reserves associated with the insolvency of one of its workers' compensation excess claims insurers. However, the decline in workers' compensation costs was offset, to some extent, by an increase in non-union health costs," said Mr. Young. "Despite a decline in second quarter LTL tonnage per day, 2005 second quarter operating results illustrate that ABF's business is still at a level where improvement of yields through an emphasis on individual account profitability and strict cost control can produce a very profitable quarter," said Mr. Young.
     ABF's second quarter LTL tonnage per day decreased by 3.4% versus last year. "Last year, beginning in April and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, ABF experienced an increase in LTL tonnage of nearly nine percent compared to the last nine months of 2003. Now, a year later, our comparative LTL tonnage figures are coming up short of those levels," said Mr. Young. ABF's 2005 second quarter truckload tonnage per day increased by 7.8% over the same period last year. "Once again ABF had strong growth in its truckload tonnage, continuing a trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2003," said Mr. Young. Through the first twenty-one days of July, average daily tonnage figures in ABF's total business are lower than last year by a little more than three percent.
     Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight was $27.53 versus last year's second quarter figure of $25.37. Billed LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 3.2%. "Though very competitive, the LTL pricing environment remains solid," said Mr. Young. "We are pleased with the current retention level of the May 23 general rate increase. In addition, the percentage of price increases on contract renewals continues to be encouraging." ABF's second quarter 2005 LTL weight per shipment increased by just under one percent compared to the second quarter of 2004. Second quarter 2005 LTL length of haul declined by 1.4% versus the same period in 2004. LTL freight density was flat compared to the second quarter of 2004. Increases in weight per shipment and decreases in length of haul cause revenue per hundredweight to go down.
     ABF's billed truckload revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 8.1%. "These larger shipments, which are priced at levels that produce good margins, help fill available capacity within ABF's network," said Mr. Young. "ABF will continue to pursue truckload-sized shipments as long as service on its base LTL business is not adversely affected and the good margins we currently have can be maintained."
     "ABF's second quarter productivity measures on the dock and in the city pickup and delivery operation were consistent with those of recent quarters, though they are below those of the second quarter of 2004. The increase in truckload shipments, which on a per-bill basis are generally more labor intensive to pickup and deliver, combined with fewer LTL shipments
 
reduced second quarter productivity measures in ABF's street and dock operations compared to last year," said Mr. Young. "However, the yard productivity of trailer movement to and from the dock at ABF's largest facilities was at its highest level since the third quarter of 2003."
     ABF's second quarter cargo claim ratio, a measure of net cash payouts to revenue, was 0.72%, an improvement when compared to this year's first quarter. "We believe ABF's full-year 2004 cargo claim ratio of 0.79% was one of the best in the LTL industry. We are pleased with progress that was made in the second quarter to further reduce cargo claims," said Mr. Young. "ABF's emphasis on undamaged deliveries provides value to its customers and to the marketplace."
ABF's Premium Service Employee Agreement
     In May 2005, ABF reached agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union on specific language outlining ABF's use of the Premium Service Employee provisions of its labor agreement in 13 Northeastern facilities. ABF's implementation of this service began in June. "We are excited about the opportunities this agreement offers for new business within our company and for additional employee jobs," said Mr. Young. "We are also encouraged by the enthusiasm and support our existing employees have shown for this new service. As a result of this agreement, ABF will be able to offer more second-day service lanes and can now provide overnight and even same-day service in selective lanes in the dense Northeastern market. The rollout of this service will be deliberate and ABF will build on initial successes in additional locations."

     Clipper's second quarter 2005 revenue was $28.8 million, a 15.0% increase over second quarter 2004 revenue of $25.0 million. "Every Clipper division experienced second quarter revenue growth over last year, highlighted by a 30% increase in truck brokerage revenue and an 18% increase in the revenue of Clipper's temperature-controlled division," said Mr. Young. Clipper's second quarter 2005 operating ratio was 95.4% compared to a second quarter 2004 operating ratio of 97.1%. "This was Clipper's best quarterly operating ratio for any quarter since 1997," said Mr. Young.
     "Clipper's temperature-controlled division had solid second quarter margins due to strong customer demand for its spot market, rail capacity. This resulted from the availability of a large number of loads containing high-quality produce combined with fewer truck options for moving those loads eastbound from the West Coast," said Mr. Young. "Clipper's brokerage division added several new accounts and maintained its positive first quarter momentum because of
 
continuing good service from its trucking partners. Clipper's intermodal division improved its second quarter revenues and operating margins with new accounts and additional business from existing accounts. Finally, the addition of profitable revenue, combined with ongoing cost control measures, has reduced the impact of overhead costs on Clipper's margins."
Common Stock Purchase
     During the second quarter of 2005, Arkansas Best made open-market purchases, totaling 125,000 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $4.0 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since February 2003, as a part of a previously announced program to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of its common stock, Arkansas Best has purchased a total of 634,150 shares totaling $17.9 million. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
Credit Agreement Extension
     As of June 3, 2005, Arkansas Best amended and restated its existing $225 million Credit Agreement. The agreement is for five years and is now scheduled to mature on May 15, 2010. The amended agreement provides for reductions in facility fees, letter of credit fees and applicable interest margins. Under the amended agreement, the financial ratios Arkansas Best is required to maintain are less restrictive. In addition, Arkansas Best no longer has a borrowing base requirement and is not bound by certain other financial covenants contained in the previous credit agreement.
California Terminal Properties
     In August 2001, Arkansas Best sold the stock of its subsidiary, G.I. Trucking Company (G.I.). As part of the sales transaction, Arkansas Best retained the ownership of three California terminal facilities and has been leasing them to G.I. The lease agreements contain options for G.I. to purchase the three terminals. Arkansas Best and G.I. have now reached agreement of all terms for G.I. to purchase these terminals. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur on or before July 28. As a result, Arkansas Best anticipates recognizing an after-tax gain of $9.8 million ($0.38 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2005. The gain includes the assumption of certain obligations by G.I.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 24, 2005, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2005 results. The press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures of earnings and earnings per share. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because it provides a more comparable measure of earnings and earnings per share. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated October 24, 2005.
99.1
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 24, 2005)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2005 net income of $40.6 million, or $1.59 per diluted common share, compared to third quarter 2004 net income of $27.4 million, or $1.07 per diluted common share. Excluding an after-tax gain of $9.8 million ($0.38 per diluted common share) related to the July 2005 sale of three non-ABF terminal facilities located in California to G.I. Trucking Company, third quarter 2005 earnings per diluted common share were $1.21. Arkansas Best's after-tax return on capital employed for the twelve months ended September 30, 2005 was 20.6%. Arkansas Best's revenue during the third quarter of 2005 was $489.9 million, an increase of 6.1% over the third quarter of 2004.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had third quarter 2005 revenue of $451.8 million, a per-day increase of 5.6% compared to third quarter 2004 revenue of $427.9 million. ABF's third quarter 2005 operating ratio was 88.5% versus an operating ratio of 89.2% during the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 operating income at ABF was $52.0 million compared to $46.2 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 12.5%. "ABF generated the highest quarterly operating income in its history and, on a comparable reporting basis, the best quarterly operating ratio in over twenty-five years," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
     "The improvement in ABF's third quarter operating ratio was accomplished because of a combination of good pricing and consistent cost controls," said Mr. Young. "Total revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by over one percent, despite a significant shift in profile. ABF's yield and profitability improvement were enhanced by improved yield on
 
larger shipments and increased handling of TimeKeeper shipments, those moving under ABF's guaranteed, expedited and time-definite shipping service. Though TimeKeeper's impact on third quarter results is relatively small, this business is growing rapidly. TimeKeeper's profitability is good and customers find these services quite valuable," said Mr. Young. "ABF's LTL tonnage was below the strong levels experienced in the third quarter of 2004, yet ABF was able to manage its variable costs in order to maximize the profitability of the shipments moving through its network. ABF's profitability improved as a result of reducing the use of rail in higher-cost lanes and the associated drayage and equipment shuttles. ABF used fewer local cartage agents for shipment pickup and delivery and reduced employee overtime. In addition, ABF's third quarter workers' compensation costs declined by $1.7 million because of fewer new claims and favorable severity trends on existing claims. However, casualty claims costs increased by $1.6 million as a result of adverse severity trends on existing claims. ABF's third quarter cargo claims costs declined from last year by $567,000."
     ABF's total tonnage per day in the third quarter of 2005 was down slightly versus a year ago, decreasing by 0.4%. Compared to the same periods last year, LTL tonnage per day decreased 6.3% in June 2005; 5.6% in July 2005; 2.9% in August 2005 and 0.7% in September 2005. Overall, third quarter 2005 LTL tonnage per day decreased 3.0% compared to third quarter 2004. "Though third quarter 2005 LTL tonnage was below that of last year's very strong third quarter, I am encouraged by the significantly improving trends in the LTL tonnage comparisons over the last few months," said Mr. Young.
     ABF's 2005 third quarter truckload tonnage per day increased by 10.1%, including an increase of 15.6% in September. "For the last two years, ABF has experienced strong growth in truckload tonnage and this year's third quarter is no exception," said Mr. Young. "As long as ABF is able to earn comparable profit margins on these shipments and service on its core LTL business is not adversely affected, ABF will continue to pursue these larger shipments in order to fill available capacity." Through the first twenty days of October, average daily tonnage figures in ABF's total business are slightly ahead of the same period last year.
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $24.43 compared to $22.84 in the third quarter of 2004. Total billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 1.2%. "ABF continues to secure reasonable price increases in a very stable, but competitive, pricing environment," said Mr. Young. ABF's third quarter 2005 total weight per shipment increased by 3.6% versus the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 total length of haul
 
declined by 0.8% compared to the third quarter of 2004. Increases in weight per shipment and decreases in length of haul cause revenue per hundredweight to go down.
     "ABF's productivity measures on the dock and in the city pickup and delivery operation are consistent with the first half of the year, but below those of the third quarter of 2004. As in this year's second quarter, ABF's shipment mix is impacting these statistics," said Mr. Young. "Larger shipments moving throughout ABF's network, combined with a significant increase in truckload shipments requiring additional pickup, delivery and dock labor, have caused a decrease in "per shipment" productivity compared to last year's third quarter," said Mr. Young. "As has been the case throughout this entire year, the yard productivity of trailer movement at ABF's largest facilities exceeded that of the same period last year."
     During the third quarter, hurricanes Katrina and Rita had minimal impact on ABF's operations in the Gulf Coast and South Texas regions. All ABF facilities in these areas are now fully operational, limited only by public infrastructure damage and accessibility to customer locations. "Fortunately, none of ABF's employees were injured or killed as a result of these terrible storms, though several lost many of their possessions," said Mr. Young. "We will continue to support our employees and assist the relief agencies serving these areas."
     From September 7 through October 4, 2005, ABF limited its standard fuel surcharge due to the extremely volatile fuel prices resulting from Hurricane Katrina. During this period, ABF's fuel surcharge was capped at the pre-Katrina level that was established on August 29. Had ABF charged its standard fuel surcharge percentage, approximately $2.2 million of additional revenue would have been earned. This reduced Arkansas Best's third quarter earnings by $0.05 per diluted common share.
Clipper
     For the third quarter of 2005, Clipper had revenues of $26.7 million, an 8.6% increase over third quarter 2004 revenue of $24.6 million. "As seen last quarter, the revenue in each division of Clipper increased compared to last year, highlighted by a 19.3% increase in truck brokerage revenue," said Mr. Young. Clipper's third quarter 2005 operating ratio improved to 97.8% compared to a third quarter 2004 operating ratio of 99.2%.
 
     "Clipper experienced solid third quarter demand for its services in all segments," said Mr. Young. "Fuel cost pressures impacting over-the-road, truckload competitors created intermodal opportunities for Clipper that positively affected third quarter results. Average revenue per shipment at Clipper's temperature-controlled division increased, primarily due to tighter equipment capacity. Despite rising fuel prices, Clipper's brokerage division was able to add customers and new business throughout the quarter," said Mr. Young. "Overall, Clipper's continued focus on improved negotiation of contracts and attention to specific account profitability are resulting in enhanced margins."
Common Stock Purchase
     During the third quarter of 2005, Arkansas Best made open-market purchases, totaling 209,000 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $7.1 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Arkansas Best has now purchased a total of 843,150 shares totaling $25.0 million. This completes a program, announced in January 2003, to repurchase up to a maximum of $25 million of Arkansas Best's common stock.
     On July 28, 2005, Arkansas Best's Board of Directors announced the authorization of an additional $50 million to Arkansas Best's stock repurchase program. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2005 third quarter results.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On January 26, 2006, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2005 results. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated January 26, 2006.
99.1
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 26, 2006)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced fourth quarter 2005 net income of $30.2 million, or $1.18 per diluted common share, compared to fourth quarter 2004 net income of $24.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's revenue during the fourth quarter of 2005 was $496.4 million, a per-day increase of 11.0% over the fourth quarter of 2004.
     "Arkansas Best had an outstanding year in 2005 including a 20.7% After-Tax Return on Capital Employed, the highest level since Arkansas Best began using this financial measure in 1998," said Robert A. Young III, Arkansas Best Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "For the third consecutive year-end, Arkansas Best had no outstanding debt on its revolving credit facility. With cash and short-term investments of $127 million at the close of 2005, Arkansas Best remains in one of the strongest financial positions in the trucking industry," said Mr. Young.
     For the full year of 2005, Arkansas Best reported net income of $104.6 million, or $4.06 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $75.5 million, or $2.94 per diluted common share in 2004. Excluding an after-tax gain of $9.8 million related to the July 2005 sale of three non-ABF terminal facilities to G.I. Trucking Company, full-year 2005 earnings were $3.68 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's 2005 full-year revenue was $1.86 billion, a per-day increase of 8.9% over 2004 full-year revenue. For the full-year 2005, ABF Freight System, Inc. produced an operating ratio of 90.9%, its second best in the last twenty-nine years, record operating income of $155.6 million and a per-day increase in revenue of 8.2%.
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System had revenue of $455.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2005, a per-day increase of 10.2% compared to fourth quarter 2004 revenue of $420.3 million. ABF's operating income during the 2005 fourth quarter was $48.4 million compared to $40.1 million in the same period last year. ABF's fourth quarter 2005 operating ratio was 89.4% compared to its fourth quarter 2004 operating ratio of 90.5%.
     ABF's fourth quarter 2005 total tonnage per day increased 1.4% compared to the same period last year. "Throughout the fourth quarter, ABF experienced a positive pattern of monthly total tonnage growth. Compared to the same periods last year, total tonnage per day was generally flat in October, increased 1.4% in November and increased 2.9% in December," said Mr. Young.
     To this point in January, the average daily tonnage figures in ABF's total business are trending somewhat ahead of December's increase. "I am encouraged by the positive tonnage figures we are seeing in January. I am especially pleased to see this during the seasonally slow, early part of the first quarter. However, in the past, the month of March has always had the greatest impact on first quarter tonnage changes," said Mr. Young.
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $24.30, an increase of 7.7% over last year's fourth quarter figure of $22.57. Total billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 2.5%. "There has been little change in the overall pricing environment during the fourth quarter. Pricing by both ABF and its competitors continues to be rational," said Mr. Young. "ABF has been able to secure acceptable price increases across its account mix, including those with contractual and deferred pricing agreements." ABF's fourth quarter total weight per shipment increased by 3.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2005 total length of haul declined by 1.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Increases in weight per shipment and decreases in length of haul cause revenue per hundredweight to decline.
     In both the fourth quarter and full year of 2005, ABF benefited from declines in workers' compensation costs due to fewer new claims and favorable severity trends on existing claims. These reductions bring ABF's quarterly and full-year workers' compensation costs more in line with normal historical trends. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, ABF was able to reduce its reserves for Reliance Insurance Company excess workers' compensation claims by $1.4 million because of clarification from the California Insurance Guarantee Association that, under a new state law, certain claims in the excess layer would be covered by the California
 
guaranty fund. As a result of all of these items, ABF's workers' compensation costs were lower by $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and by $7.9 million for the full year of 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004.
     "Per-bill productivity statistics on ABF's docks and in the city pickup and delivery operation are below those of the fourth quarter of 2004. As was the case throughout all of 2005, the change in ABF's overall shipment mix has impacted freight handling," said Mr. Young. "The significant 3.3% increase in ABF's fourth quarter total weight per shipment, and the need for a greater amount of pickup, delivery and dock labor in order to handle these larger shipments continue to affect per-bill-based productivity measures. In spite of reductions in certain freight handling productivity measures, the changes that are occurring in ABF's shipment profile are having a positive impact on our company's overall profitability."
     For the full year of 2005, ABF's revenue was $1.71 billion, a per-day increase of 8.2% over 2004 revenue. ABF's 2005 operating ratio was 90.9% versus 91.9% in 2004. ABF's 2005 operating income was $155.6 million versus $127.8 million during 2004. Total tonnage per day in 2005 increased 0.8% over 2004. Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $23.90, an increase of 7.3% over last year's full year figure of $22.28. Total 2005 billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 1.9% over last year.
Clipper
     For the fourth quarter of 2005, Clipper had revenue of $29.5 million, a per-day increase of 19.8% over fourth quarter 2004 revenue of $25.4 million. Clipper's fourth quarter 2005 operating ratio of 96.0% represents an improvement of over two percentage points compared to the fourth quarter 2004 operating ratio of 98.1%. "Clipper continued its recent pattern of year-over-year quarterly revenue improvement in each of its divisions, highlighted by fourth quarter, per-day revenue increases of 55.5% in freight brokerage and 23.5% in Clipper's temperature-controlled division," said Mr. Young. "Limited availability of industry equipment positively influenced business opportunities in both of these divisions. In addition, Clipper's temperature-controlled division benefited from a strong demand for produce shipments. Despite the challenges associated with sub-par rail service, Clipper's intermodal division increased its fourth quarter revenue and more than doubled its fourth quarter operating income compared to last year."
     For full year 2005, revenue at Clipper was $108.5 million, a 13.9% per-day increase over 2004 full year revenue of $96.0 million. Clipper's 2005 operating ratio was 97.2% compared to
 
a 2004 operating ratio of 99.1%. "The improvements Clipper made in 2005 are encouraging. For the year, Clipper had an After-Tax Return on Capital Employed of 12.8% and its operating income was the highest since 1997," said Mr. Young.
Common Stock Purchase
     During the fourth quarter of 2005, Arkansas Best did not make any open-market purchases of its common stock. As a part of a previously announced program, Arkansas Best can purchase up to a maximum of $50 million of its common stock. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
Capital Expenditures
     Arkansas Best estimates 2006 net capital expenditures will be approximately $125 to $145 million. Total net capital expenditures in 2005 were $64 million. The 2006 capital expenditure plan does not include expansion of the road tractor and doubles trailer fleets.
     The low end of this expected 2006 range consists of:
     A few significant items explain most of the increase in 2006 net capital expenditures. These are as follows:
 
     There is the potential for additional capital expenditures amounting to as much as $20 million above the low-end-range figure of $125 million. These could include purchases for:
     Arkansas Best's depreciation and amortization for 2006 is estimated to be approximately $70 million.
Stock-Based Compensation
     As previously announced, in April 2005 Arkansas Best granted shares of restricted stock under its 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan. In 2006, Arkansas Best Corporation anticipates granting additional shares of restricted stock under this plan. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board requires that the fair value of stock options be expensed. Arkansas Best issued stock options up until 2004 and is required to expense the fair value of its unvested stock options over the remaining vesting period. Arkansas Best estimates its 2006 expense from stock options and restricted stock grants to be approximately $4.2 million or $0.10 per diluted common share, net of taxes. In 2005, restricted stock expense was $842,467, or $0.02 per diluted common share, net of taxes.
Supplemental Pension Benefit
     Arkansas Best has an unfunded supplemental pension benefit plan for the purpose of providing supplemental retirement benefits to executive officers of the company. As previously disclosed in Arkansas Best's 3rd Quarter 2005 10-Q report, distributions of benefits to retiring officers and previously retired officers who deferred payments until 2006 will be made in the first and third quarters of 2006. Under FASB Statement No. 88, Arkansas Best is required to record a "pension accounting settlement" charge when cash payouts exceed annual service and interest costs of the related plan. As a result of this required settlement accounting, in the first quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best will record pre-tax charges estimated to be between $7.5 and $9.5 million or between $0.18 and $0.23 per diluted common share, net of taxes. For the third quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best will record pre-tax charges estimated to be between $1.0 and $1.5 million or between $0.02 and $0.04 per diluted common share, net of taxes.
 
Nonunion Defined Contribution Pension Plan
     Beginning January 1, 2006, all nonunion employees of Arkansas Best Corporation, ABF Freight System, Inc. and FleetNet America, Inc. began participating in a new, more flexible defined contribution plan into which the company will make discretionary contributions. For new employees, this plan replaces the company's nonunion defined benefit pension plan. All employees who were participants in the defined benefit pension plan on December 31, 2005 will continue in that plan. During 2006, the combined cost of these plans will be substantially similar to the expense that would have been incurred if Arkansas Best had retained the defined benefit plan for all new nonunion employees. In the future, Arkansas Best expects the combined total cost of these two plans to be cost neutral to the previous nonunion defined benefit pension plan.
new
Credit Ratings Outlook
     On December 21, Moody's Investor Service placed Arkansas Best Corporation's senior unsecured debt rating under review for possible upgrade. Moody's currently rates Arkansas Best's senior unsecured debt as Baa3 with a positive outlook. In its press release announcing this review, Moody's stated that its "review was prompted by the record of strong recent operating results and the company's conservative use of its cash balances." The review by Moody's included a detailed analysis of the trucking industry market environment and Arkansas Best's obligations under the multi-employer pension plans in which it participates.
Multi-Employer Plans
     Retirement and health care benefits for ABF's contractual employees are provided by a number of multi-employer funds. The trust funds are administered by trustees, who generally are appointed equally by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and certain management carrier organizations. ABF is not directly involved in the administration of the trust funds. ABF contributes to these funds monthly based on the hours worked by its contractual employees, as specified in the National Master Freight Agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. No amounts are required to be paid beyond ABF's monthly contractual obligations based on the hours worked by its employees, except as discussed below.
     ABF has contingent liabilities for its share of the unfunded liabilities of each fund to which it contributes. ABF's contingent liability for a fund would be triggered if it were to withdraw from that fund. ABF has no current intention of withdrawing from any of the funds. Previously, information regarding the funded status of the various funds and an estimate of
 
ABF's contingent withdrawal liabilities were not accessible. Now, because of improved disclosure and cooperation from the multi-employer funds, more of this information is available. As a result, ABF has gathered data from the majority of these funds and currently estimates its total contingent withdrawal liabilities for these funds to be approximately $500 million, on a pre-tax basis. Though the best information available to ABF was used in computing this estimate, it is calculated with numerous assumptions, is not current and is continually changing. If ABF did incur withdrawal liabilities, those amounts would generally be payable over a period of 10 to 15 years.
     Aside from the withdrawal liabilities, ABF would only have an obligation to pay an amount beyond its contractual obligations if it received official notification of a funding deficiency. ABF has not received notification of a funding deficiency and has no expectation of receiving notification of a funding deficiency for any of the funds to which it contributes. The amount of any potential funding deficiency, if it were to materialize in the future, should be substantially less than the full withdrawal liability for each fund.
     There are several factors that can provide a positive impact on the funding status of these funds. These factors include: reductions in member benefits, an increase in the contractual contributions by the participating employers, or improved investment returns on fund assets. Any combination of these items has the potential for positively affecting the funding status. In addition, the Central States Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund ("Central States"), to which ABF makes approximately 50% of its contributions, recently received a ten-year extension from the Internal Revenue Service of the period over which it amortizes unfunded liabilities. For the foreseeable future, this extension should help the Central States fund avoid a funding deficiency. Multi-employer plan funding issues, including mandatory information disclosure, are currently being addressed in proposed pension plan legislation in both houses of the United States Congress.

2005 Annual Incentive Compensation Awards
The Company's named executive officers were participants in the Company's Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). On January 25, 2006, the Committee reviewed the performance measures established under the Plan for the 2005 Plan year and determined the level of performance measure actually achieved by the Company under the Plan for 2005. In addition, the Committee determined the amount earned in 2005 under the Plan (to be paid in January 2006) by each below named executive officer.
Amounts earned under the Plan are based on the Company's return on capital employed ("ROCE"). Each named executive officer's award is based on a percentage of his 2005 base salary times the Company's 2005 percent of target incentive award earned at the ROCE percentage achieved. A minimum of 7% ROCE must be achieved before any incentive is earned. The maximum amount any individual can earn under the Plan during the performance period is $2 million.
2006 Annual Incentive Compensation Performance Measures
The Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards for 2006 under the Plan. The 2006 performance measure is based on the return on capital employed ("ROCE") for each of the Company and ABF Freight System, Inc. The 2006 ROCE performance measure is substantially the same as in 2005. A minimum of 7% ROCE must be achieved for any incentive to be earned; 10% is the target ROCE, with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive. If the target ROCE were achieved, the Company's President-CEO would receive $300,000 and each of the Company's and ABF's Senior Vice Presidents would receive $120,000. The actual incentive earned in 2006 will depend on the final level of ROCE achievedwhich will be certified by the Committee in the first quarter of 2007. The maximum amount any individual can earn under the Plan during the performance period is $2 million.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Company's stockholders approved the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan on April 20, 2005. Pursuant to such Ownership Incentive Plan, on January 25, 2006, the Committee created a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") for the three year measurement period of 2006-2008. The LTIP is comprised of two parts, an "ROCE Portion," which is given a 60% weighting, and a "Growth Portion," which is given a 40% weighting. The maximum amount any individual can earn under the 2006-2008 LTIP is $2 million.
Participants in the 2006-2008 LTIP are executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, ABF Freight System, Inc. or Data-Tronics Corp., who are not participants in the Company's Supplemental Benefit Plan or in the Deferred Salary Agreement program. In the 2006-2008 LTIP the participants are expected to be the four new ABF Vice Presidents and such other key employees as the Committee may designate.
On January 25, 2006, the Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards under the 2006-2008 LTIP. For the "ROCE Portion" the Committee determined that it would use the Company's three year average return on capital employed ("ROCE") as its performance measure and that a minimum of 7% ROCE must be achieved for any incentive to be earned and 10% is the target ROCE, with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive. If the target ROCE were achieved, the participating Vice Presidents would each receive $49,200. The actual incentive earned in 2008 for the ROCE Portion will depend on the final three year average of ROCE achieved and the participant's Base Salary as defined in the LTIP.
For the "Growth Portion" the Committee determined that the performance measure would be based on the Company achieving specified levels of operating profit margin in 2008 for two segments of ABF Freight System, Inc.'s business. If the target 2008 operating profit margin is achieved, the participating Vice Presidents would each receive $41,000 and the participant's Base Salary as defined in the LTIP.
Chairman of the Board of Directors Compensation
After his retirement as the Company's Chief Executive Officer on January 31, 2006, Robert A. Young will continue to serve as the Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors. In his non-officer Chairman capacity, Mr. Young will receive an annual retainer of $100,000, $1,500 per Board or Committee meeting, plus reimbursement of his expenses related to service of the Board of Directors.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 30, 2006)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) has received an upgrade of its senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's Investor Service. Moody's raised Arkansas Best's rating to Baa2 with a stable outlook, from Baa3.
     In today's press release announcing this change, Moody's stated that its upgrade "reflects Arkansas Best's record of strong operating and financial results throughout the economic cycle and particularly good peak cycle performance, the company's modest amount of reported debt and strong credit metrics, and the consistent record of improving the return on invested capital." Moody's press release went on to say "The rating also recognizes the competitive, capital intensive and sharply cyclical nature of the trucking industry; however, Moody's believes the company has the operating flexibility and liquidity to remain competitive throughout a down-turn." In addition, Moody's review considered Arkansas Best's contingent obligations for its share of the unfunded liabilities of each multi-employer pension fund to which it contributes.
     Arkansas Best Corporation, headquartered in Fort Smith, AR, is a transportation holding company with two primary operating subsidiaries. ABF Freight System, Inc., in continuous service since 1923, provides transportation of less-than-truckload ("LTL") general commodities throughout North America.

An Employer shall, upon request or as may be specifically required under the Plan, furnish or cause to be furnished all of the information or documentation in its possession or control that is necessary or required by the Administrator to perform its duties and functions under the Plan. 2.3 AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATOR. The Administrator shall have the exclusive authority and responsibility for administering the Plan. The Administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Plan, or to change or add to any benefits provided by this Plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for a benefit under this Plan. All exercises of authority by the Administrator under this Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding, unless found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be arbitrary and capricious. 2.4 POWERS OF ADMINISTRATOR AND COMPANY. The Administrator shall have all powers and discretion as may be necessary to discharge its duties and responsibilities under this Plan. The Administrator has the exclusive authority to interpret the Plan and decide all questions that arise under the Plan. The day-to-day administration of the Plan is delegated by the Administrator to the Benefits Department of the Company. The Administrator may engage agents to assist it and may engage legal counsel, who may be counsel for the Company. Neither the Administrator nor the Company will be responsible for any action taken or not taken on the advice of such counsel. The Administrator shall not act upon any matter involving his own rights, benefits or other participation under this Plan. 2.5 INDEMNIFICATION.

incident to the functioning of the Administrator, including, litigation costs, fees of accountants, counsel and other specialists and other costs of administering the Plan. 2.7 RELIANCE ON TABLES. In administering the Plan, the Administrator shall be entitled to the extent permitted by law to rely conclusively on all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports which are furnished by accountants, legal counsel or other experts employed or engaged by the Administrator. SECTION THREE PARTICIPATION An Eligible Individual will become a Participant on his Entry Date by filing an Election Form prior to his applicable Election Date, and will remain a Participant until he receives the payment of his entire Benefit. Being designated as an Eligible Individual for one Plan Year does not entitle such Employee to continued status as an Eligible Individual for subsequent Plan Years, but such person will remain an Eligible Individual until notified in writing by the Administrator of his removal from that status and, following such removal, such Employee shall not be able to elect Compensation Deferral Contributions on any Entry Date on which he is not an Eligible Individual. SECTION FOUR CONTRIBUTIONS 4.1 COMPENSATION DEFERRAL CONTRIBUTIONS. An Employee who is an Eligible Individual on an Entry Date with respect to a Plan Year may elect to defer up to seventy-five percent (75%) of his Salary for the portion of the Plan Year following such Entry Date, and/or up to seventy-five percent (75%) of a Bonus designated as earned after an Entry Date by the timely filing an Election Form with the Administrator with respect to such Entry Date on or prior to the applicable Election Date. Each Election Form shall only be effective for the Plan Year with respect to which such election was timely filed with the Administrator. If a new Election Form is not timely filed with the Administrator for a specified Plan Year, no Compensation Deferral Contributions will be made for such Employee until a new Election Form is timely filed with the Administrator in accordance with this Section. A Participant may not change his Compensation Deferral Contributions during a Plan Year. 4.2 CREDITING OF COMPENSATION DEFERRAL CONTRIBUTIONS. The amount of a Participant's Compensation Deferral Contributions will be deducted (i) from a Participant's Salary on each payroll date during the Plan Year of reference in an amount equal to the total Compensation Deferral Contribution attributable to Salary divided by the number of payroll dates during the Plan Year of reference following the Entry Date of reference, and (ii) from a Participant's Bonus on the date of its payment in the full amount of Compensation Deferral Contribution elected to be deducted from such Bonus payment. The portion of the Compensation Deferral Contribution amount which is deducted from Salary shall be credited to the Participant's Compensation Deferral Account as soon as reasonably possible following the payroll date on which deducted; and, regardless of the date designated by the Administrator as of which the Bonus is earned, the full amount of the 8
Compensation Deferral Contribution to be deducted from the Bonus shall be credited to the Participant's Compensation Deferral Account as soon as reasonably possible following the date the Bonus actually is (or would have been) paid. If the amount of the Compensation Deferral Contributions elected to be deducted from the Participant's Salary and/or Bonus exceeds such Salary and/or Bonus, as applicable, then the Compensation Deferral Contribution shall be reduced to equal the maximum amount of such Participant's Salary and/or Bonus, as applicable, that is available for deferral. 4.3 MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. An Employer shall credit to a Participant's Account fifteen cents ($.15) for every dollar for Match Qualified Deferrals that such Participant elects as his Compensation Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year, up to a maximum Matching Contribution of $15,000 per Plan Year. Matching Contributions are credited as of each payroll period. SECTION FIVE PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS 5.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNT. The Administrator shall establish separate Accounts for each Participant, to which shall be credited or debited the Participant's share of Contributions and Earnings, and to which shall be debited the Account's distributions. 5.2 EARNINGS CREDITED TO ACCOUNTS. Earnings shall be credited to Accounts based on Measurement Preferences (or Alternative Earnings Rate) as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application. 5.3 INVESTMENT DIRECTION. Effective as of each Investment Date, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator, and separately for existing balances in his or her Account and for future Contributions. No actual investments shall be made by Participants. The Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Employer's payment obligation under the Plan and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Employer or the Trustee. The Administrator shall have the right to eliminate or add Measurement Preferences from time to time at his sole discretion. A Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing a written Election Form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Participant has not filed an Election Form with respect to his Account, he will be deemed to have elected to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment or an Election Form. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Participants by advising the affected Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Election Form selecting or changing a Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects a 9
selection, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be deemed invested in the Money Market Fund until a Measurement Preference is approved. 5.4 STATEMENTS. As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Account, (ii) the amount of Contributions, separately showing the Compensation Deferral Contributions and Employer Contributions, credited to his Account during such period, (iii) the Earnings credited or debited to his Account for such period, and (iv) any debited charges to, or distributions from, his Account during such period. SECTION SIX VESTING 6.1 COMPENSATION DEFERRAL ACCOUNT. Participant shall always be one hundred percent (100%) Vested in the amounts credited to his Compensation Deferral Account. 6.2 EMPLOYER ACCOUNT. A Participant shall Vest in the amount credited to his Employer Account upon meeting the requirements of each of the below subsections (a) and (b): (a) YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE COMPANY. A Participant must have completed his fifth Year of Service with the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, a Participant will meet the requirements of this Section 6.2(a) upon the date of the earliest of the Participant's Separation due to death, Disability, retirement at or after age 65, or a Change in Control. (b) MATCH QUALIFIED DEFERRALS. Prior to January 1, 2002 - each Compensation Deferral Contribution is automatically a Match Qualified Deferral and its Company Match is 100% Vested, subject to Section 6.2(a). January 1, 2002 and thereafter - each Compensation Deferral Contribution is Match Qualified Deferral and is 100% Vested, subject to Section 6.2(a), if its Deferred Payment Date begins after the earliest of: (i) Participant's 60th birthday or later, (ii) Five years from (and including) the year in which the Participant's Compensation Deferral Contributions pursuant to Section 4.1 are made, and (iii) Separation due to death, Disability, termination of employment, or Change in Control. 10
A Compensation Deferral Contribution that is not initially a Match Qualified Deferral pursuant to this Section 6.2 (b) may become so at a later date once the above criteria is met. Conversely, if the Deferred Payment Date for a Compensation Deferral Contribution that is initially a Match Qualified Deferral subsequently fails to meet the above criteria, the Company Match and associated investment earnings previously credited to a Participant's Employer Account will be forfeited. SECTION SEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFIT 7.1 ELECTION OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS. A Participant shall be entitled to a Deferred Payment if he has filed an Election Form on which he has (i) selected a Deferred Payment Date, and (ii) selected a form of payment. A Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time, and may be paid in a Lump Sum or in one (1) to fifteen (15) Annual Installment Payments, as the Participant shall select on the Election Form in effect on his Final Deferral Filing Date, and only the last Election Form filed on or before such Final Deferral Filing Date shall be effective. For the avoidance of doubt, a Deferred Payment Date may be elected (A) by reference to a specified date that is at least one year after the Election Date for Compensation Deferrals for the Plan Year with respect to which the Deferred Payment Date relates, (B) the date of the Participant's Separation, (C) by reference to a specified anniversary of the date of Participant's Separation or (D) by reference to the earlier or later to occur of any combination of the events described in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 7.1. 7.2 TYPES OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS. (a) ANNUAL PERCENTAGE INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. If Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of an Annual Installment Percentage Payment, each installment shall be equal to the product of (i) his Benefit attributable to the Accounts for the particular Plan Year of reference as of the Deferred Payment Date, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid. Without limitation, a Participant may receive multiple Annual Percentage Installment Payments, each attributable to Deferred Payments from Accounts with respect to different Plan Years. (b) ANNUAL FIXED DOLLAR INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. If Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of a Fixed Dollar Annual Installment Payment, each installment shall be equal to the Participant's specified Fixed Dollar amount with a final installment equal to the remaining balance of the deferral until the entire deferral is paid. Without limitation, a Participant may receive multiple Annual Fixed Dollar Installment Payments, each attributable to Deferred Payments from Accounts with respect to different Plan Years. (c) LUMP SUM PAYMENT. If a Participant elects a Lump Sum distribution of his Benefit, the Lump Sum shall be paid on its Deferred Payment Date as soon as reasonably possible (not to exceed sixty (60) days) following the Business Day on 11
which his distributable Benefit is determined in accordance with Rules of General Application. See Separation by Specified Employee below. 7.3 CHANGE OF DEFERRED PAYMENT DATE. A Participant may change his election as to the timing and/or form of Deferred Payment by filing a specified form with the Administrator designating a new date or form of payment, but the election must be filed at least twelve (12) months prior to the date on which the first payment would have begun, the election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date of such election, and the new payout date must be no earlier than five (5) years from the date payments otherwise would have commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, the five (5) year requirement shall not apply. In addition, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals no election change pursuant to this Section 7.3 may have the effect of accelerating the time of payment of any distributions, except to the extent permitted under the Act without the imposition of any penalties or additional taxes under the Act. 7.4 MANDATORY LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION. Subject to Section 7.5, in the event of a Separation by a Participant: (i) who has not attained the age of 55 and completed at least 10 Years of Vesting Service with the Company, or (ii) whose aggregate Benefit is less than $5,000, he shall receive a Lump Sum distribution of his Benefit, as soon as reasonably possible (not to exceed sixty (60) days) following the Business Day on which his distributable Benefit is determined in accordance with Rules of General Application. 7.5 SEPARATION BY SPECIFIED EMPLOYEE. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals only, a Specified Employee may not receive a distribution of his Benefit on account of his Separation until the earlier of (i) six months after the date of such Separation or (ii) the Participant's death. 7.6 CHANGE IN CONTROL. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, or which are being paid in Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, but not Post-2004 Deferrals, a Participant may elect to waive the provisions of this Section 7.6 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 7.6 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the 12
ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder. 7.7 HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTION. Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by the Participant) that the Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship", the Administrator shall distribute to Participant that portion of such Participant's Benefit as requested by the Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either the Participant or his spouse or dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the Participant's control, which the Participant cannot satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. The Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval. If a Participant receives a hardship distribution he shall be ineligible to elect Compensation Deferral Contributions until the first enrollment period occurring after the first anniversary of the date of such withdrawal. 7.8 NON-SCHEDULED IN-SERVICE WITHDRAWAL. Non-Scheduled In-Service Withdrawals are not permitted with respect to Post 2004 Deferrals. With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, prior to a Participant's Separation, a Participant may elect to receive a distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of his Benefit without regard to the Deferred Payment Date elected by the Participant. If a Participant elects to receive such a distribution, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from his Benefit (and irrevocably forfeited), such Participant's current Compensation Deferral Contribution shall immediately cease, and such Participant shall be ineligible to elect to recommence Compensation Deferral Contributions until an Entry Date occurring after the first enrollment period occurring after the first anniversary of the date of such withdrawal. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Employer in the manner determined by the Administrator. Non-Scheduled In-Service Withdrawals shall cause a Match Qualified Deferral to become unqualified if the Non-Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal distribution is made from Compensation Deferral Contributions with Company Match that has not yet Vested or not yet Qualified under Section 6.2. If this occurs, the Company Match and associated investment earnings previously credited to the Compensation Deferral Account will be forfeited before the Non-Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal is paid. 13
7.9 SOURCE OF DISTRIBUTION. All payments of Benefits shall be in cash from the funds in the Trust or, in the discretion or the Employer, from the Employer's funds held outside of the Trust. Nothing contained in the Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company, an Employer, Participant, Beneficiary, or Employee or other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to be paid Benefits, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of his Employer. SECTION EIGHT DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARIES 8.1 DESIGNATION BY PARTICIPANT. Participant's written designation of one or more persons or entities as his Beneficiary shall operate to designate the Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan. The Participant shall file with the Administrator a copy of his Beneficiary designation under the Plan. The last such designation received by the Administrator shall be controlling, and no designation, or change or revocation of a designation shall be effective unless received by the Administrator prior to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. 8.2 LACK OF DESIGNATION. If no Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of Participant's death, if no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant or if the otherwise applicable Beneficiary designation conflicts with applicable law, the Participant's estate shall be the Beneficiary. The Administrator may direct the Employer or Trustee to retain any unpaid Benefits, without crediting for either Measurement Preferences or Alternative Earnings Rate, until all rights to the unpaid Benefits are determined. Alternatively, the Administrator may direct the Employer or Trustee to pay the Benefits into any court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any such payment shall completely discharge each Employer, the Trustee, and the Administrator from any liability under the Plan. SECTION NINE AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Company, through its Board of Directors, may in its discretion amend the Plan from time-to-time, provided that no Amendment may reduce a Participant's Benefit. Specifically, termination of the Plan shall require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby delegates to its executive officers the authority to make any amendment (i) that does not increase the benefit costs of the Plan to the Company by more than 1% of the Plan's prior calendar year financial statement expense or (ii) that is necessary or desirable in order to have it conform to the provisions and requirements of the Code, AJCA or any other applicable law. In the event of a termination of the Plan, all Participants shall become 100% Vested on such date of termination and, notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the 14
Benefits of such affected Participant may, in the Company's sole discretion, be distributed in a Lump Sum as soon as administratively possible (not to exceed 60 days) following such termination with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals only to the extent permitted by the Act without the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under the Act). SECTION TEN GENERAL PROVISIONS 10.1 NO ASSIGNMENT. The right of any Participant to Benefits shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except as provided in SECTION EIGHT with respect to designations of Beneficiaries or between spouses incident to divorce within the meaning of Code Section 1041 or of any successor provision, pursuant to a transfer permitted by the Act and other applicable law. 10.2 INCAPACITY. If the Administrator shall find that any person to whom any Benefit is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, any payment due shall be paid to the duly appointed guardian, Administrator or other legal representative for such person. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of each Employer, the Trustee and the Administrator as to the amount paid. 10.3 CLAIMS PROCEDURE. The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any Employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any Employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 90 days after receipt of notice of denial. In making an appeal the claimant may examine pertinent Plan documents and may submit issues and comments in writing. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing by the Administrator delivered to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the Administrator's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 90 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 180 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. If the claim involves a determination of whether or not the Participant has experienced a Disability (a "Disability Claim"), such claim will generally be decided and the claimant notified of the decision within 45 days after receipt of the claim; provided that the Administrator may obtain two 45-day extensions if the proper written notice, which contains the information described above, is given to the Participant before the end of each applicable 45-day period. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits 15
determination on review. If the denied claim is a Disability Claim, the following additional information will be provided with the denial notice: (a) if an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion, or a statement that such a rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination and that a copy of such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon written request; and (b) if the adverse benefit determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon written request. Within 60 days after receiving a denial (180 days in the case of a Disability Claim), the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator. On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. If the appeal involves a Disability Claim, the following additional procedures shall apply to the review on appeal: (i) it will be conducted by a Plan fiduciary that is neither the individual who made the initial adverse benefit determination, nor the subordinate of such individual; (ii) if the initial adverse decision was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, the reviewer will consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and who is not the same person (or his or her subordinate) that was consulted in connection with the initial benefits decision; and (iii) upon request, the claimant will be provided the identification of the expert whose advise was obtained in connection with the initial benefit decision, if any, regardless of whether or not the advice was relied upon. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days (45 days in the case of a Disability Claim) after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal (90 days in the case of a Disability Claim). If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render its final decision. Subject to Section 2.3, the Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA. In addition, if the appeal involved a 16
Disability Claim, the denial notice will include the additional information for Disability Claims described above, as applicable. The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Employer, through written resolution, appoints another agent. 10.4 NO GUARANTY OF DEFERRAL. While the Company intends that this Plan will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds credited hereunder until such time as they actually shall be paid to a Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by Participants in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Eligible Individual electing to become a Participant should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for participation in this Plan. 10.5 COMMUNICATIONS BY, AND INFORMATION FROM, PARTICIPANT. Each Participant shall file with the Administrator such pertinent information concerning him and his Beneficiary as the Administrator may specify, and no Participant or Beneficiary or other person shall have any rights or be entitled to any benefits under the Plan, unless such information is properly filed. All elections, selections, designations, requests, notices, instructions and other communications to the Administrator, Third-Party Recordkeeper, Company, or Employer required or permitted under the Plan shall be (i) in such form as is prescribed from time to time by the Administrator, (ii) shall be (x) mailed by first-class mail, or (y) delivered, to such location as shall be specified by the Administrator and shall be deemed to have been given and delivered only on actual receipt by the person to be charged at such location. If the Administrator notifies the Participant or Beneficiary by registered mail (return receipt requested) at his last known address that he is entitled to a distribution and also notifies him of the provisions of this paragraph, and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim his benefits under the Plan or provide his current address to the Administrator within one year after such notification, his Benefit will be forfeited and inure to the benefit of the Employer in the manner determined by the Administrator. If the Participant or Beneficiary is subsequently located, such Benefit will be restored, but without Earnings being credited subsequent to the date of the forfeiture. 10.6 NO RIGHTS IMPLIED. Without limitation, nothing contained in this Plan, nor any modification or amendment to the Plan, nor the creation of any Account on the books of the Company, shall give any Employee or Participant any legal or equitable right against the Company or any officer, director, or Employee of the Company, except as expressly provided by the Plan. 10.7 COMMUNICATIONS BY ADMINISTRATOR OR EMPLOYER. All notices, statements, reports and other communications from the Administrator or any Employer to any person required or permitted under the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered to, or when mailed first-class mail, postage prepaid and addressed to, such person at his address last 17
appearing on the records of the most recent Employer or provided to the last known electronic address on record. 10.8 INTERPRETATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS. To the extent permitted by law, each interpretation of the Plan and each decision on any matter relating to the Plan made by the Board, the Company, or the Administrator, within their scope of their authority hereunder, shall be made in their sole discretion and shall be binding on all persons. A misstatement or other mistake of fact shall be corrected when it becomes known and the person responsible shall make such adjustment on account thereof as he considers equitable and practicable. 10.9 NO LIABILITY FOR GOOD FAITH DETERMINATIONS. Neither the Company, the Board, nor the Administrator shall be liable for any act, omission, or determination taken or made with respect to the Plan which is not judicially determined to be due to willful misconduct, and members of the Board, and the Administrator, shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement by the Company in respect of any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including attorneys' fees, the costs of settling any suit, provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company, and amounts paid in satisfaction of a judgment, except a judgment based on a finding of willful misconduct) arising therefrom to the full extent permitted by law and under any directors' and officers' liability or similar insurance coverage that may from time to time be in effect. 10.10 NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. Neither the Plan nor any action taken under the Plan shall be construed as giving to any Employee the right to be retained in the employ of an Employer or as affecting the right of an Employer to dismiss any Employee at any time, with or without cause. 10.11 WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. An Employer shall deduct from Participant's Salary, Bonus or the amount of any payment made pursuant to this Plan any amounts required to be paid or withheld by the federal government or any state or local government. By his participation in the Plan, the Participant agrees to all such deductions. 10.12 WAIVERS. Any waiver of any right granted pursuant to this Plan shall not be valid unless the same is in writing and signed by the party waiving such right. Any such waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other rights. 10.13 RECORDS.

ARKANSAS BEST CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLAN AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005 Article I. Establishment and Purpose 1.1 Establishment. Arkansas Best Corporation established the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "PLAN") effective as of January 1, 1988 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE"), and hereby amends and restates it (except as otherwise herein provided) as of January 1, 2005. 1.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Plan is to provide (i) a restoration of benefits of Category I Participants which were lost under the Qualified Plan (x) because of amendments which were adopted, and Statutory Limitations imposed, subsequent to 1985, and (y) by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP; and (ii) a restoration of benefits of Category II Participants which were lost under the Current Qualified Plan solely by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP. The purpose of this amendment and restatement of the Plan is to comply with the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") in order to avoid immediate taxation of amounts deferred hereunder, and the Plan will be interpreted accordingly. With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, the Plan shall be interpreted so as to avoid having such Pre-2005 Deferrals subject to the Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Plan shall be closed to new Participants from and after December 16, 2005; (ii) benefits payable to existing Category II Participants shall only take into account amounts deferred under the VSP (as defined below) on or before December 31, 2006; and (iii) the Benefits payable hereunder shall be subject to the maximum caps set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

Article III. Participation 3.1 Participation. Participation in this Plan shall be limited to those persons (i) who are Participants on December 16, 2005. Article IV. Benefit and Payment 4.1 Benefit. (a) Benefits of Category I Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category I Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of (i) the benefits which would be payable to the Category I Participant under the Qualified Plan if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered (x) without regard to the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (y) without regard to the limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17)of the Code, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such person under the Current Qualified Plan, with the benefits in both (i) and (ii) being computed as of the date the Category I Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Without limitation, the amount described in "(i)" shall be determined as if the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation were amended by (iii) deleting all direct or indirect references to the provisions of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (iv) adding thereto a provision which would cause the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation to include all amounts which a Category I Participant shall contribute to the VSP as a Compensation Deferral Contribution (as defined in the VSP); and (v) applying the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation so as to reflect the historical intent and practice of excluding all income which the Company considered as not subject to FICA tax, including without limitation, the exclusion of all income from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Basic Benefits payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category I Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category I Participant solely under 7
the Qualified Plan had Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code not been applicable thereto, and had he not elected to make Compensation Deferral Contribution(s) as defined in the VSP; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any service or compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category I Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan with respect to service and compensation to the extent, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, he receives benefits with respect thereto under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan. (b) Benefit of Category II Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit. (c) Vesting Schedule. Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule: 1.67% vesting for each month of participation as a Category I Participant in the Plan The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested. 8
This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above. 4.2 Payment. Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 4.3 Funding. All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. 4.4 Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment. 4.5 Benefits are Not Compensation. No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such 9
Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control. 4.6 Nontransferability. A Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law other than by will or the laws of distribution or between spouses or incident to a divorce within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Code or any successor provision (provided any such permitted transfer shall remain subject to all other provisions of this Plan). Article V. Deferrals And Investments 5.1 Elections. Each Eligible Deferral Participant may file a Deferral Election form with the Administrator and become a Deferred Participant, provided such filing is made prior to his Final Election Date under Section 2(y)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant who desires to defer all or a portion of the Participant's Basic Benefit must file an initial Deferral Election form with the Administrator by December 31, 2006, or, if later, 30 days following the date the individual first becomes a Participant in the Plan; provided, however, that an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2006 may not (i) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2006, or (ii) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2006 that would not have otherwise been made in 2006. In addition, a Participant may file subsequent Deferral Election forms prior to the Final Election Date; provided, however, that with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, any subsequent Deferral Election, including any Deferral Election made by a Deferred Participant with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, (a) will not be effective until 12 months following the date the new Deferral Election form is filed, (b) must provide for the delay of the Deferral Payment Date for at least 5 additional years and (c) must not provide for the accelerated payment of any portion of such Post-2004 Deferrals. 5.2 Establishment of Deferral Account. The Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account for each Deferred Participant, (i) to which shall be added the deferred portion of such Deferred Participant's Basic Benefit effective not less than thirty (30) days after his Separation, (ii) to which shall be added (or deducted) Earnings, and (iii) from which shall be deducted Deferred Payments. 5.3 Earnings Added to Deferral Accounts. Earnings shall be added to each Deferral Account based on the Deferred Participant's Measurement Preference as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application. 5.4 Investment Direction. Effective as of each Business Day, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Deferred Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator. No actual investments shall be made by Deferred Participants. The Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Company's payment 10
obligation under Article VI and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Company. A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved. 5.5 No Guaranty of Deferral. While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form. 5.6 Statements. As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period. Article VI. Distributions to Deferred Participants 6.1 Form of Deferred Payments. A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. 11
Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective. 6.2 Installment Payments. If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator. 6.3 Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder. 6.4 Hardship Distribution. Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or 12
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval. 6.5 Accelerated Withdrawal. A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals. Article VII. Administration 7.1 Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan. 7.2 Finality of Determination. The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons. 7.3 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company. 7.4 Indemnification and Exculpation. The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall 13
not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Article VIII. Merger, Amendment, and Termination 8.1 Merger, Consolidation. In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act. 8.2 Claims Procedure. The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator. On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal. If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render 14
its final decision. The Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Company, through written resolution, appoints another agent. 8.3 Securities Laws. The Plan intends to comply with and be exempt under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Deferred Participants under the Plan are final purchasers and not underwriters or conduits to other beneficial owners or subsequent purchasers. 8.4 Amendment and Termination. The Company, through its Board of Directors, may in its discretion amend the Plan from time-to-time. Specifically, termination of the Plan shall require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby delegates to its executive officers the authority to make any amendment (i) that does not increase the benefit costs of the Plan to the Company by more than 1% of the Plan's prior calendar year financial statement expense or (ii) that is necessary or desirable in order to have it conform to the provisions and requirements of the Code, AJCA or any other applicable law. In the event of an amendment or termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section or Section 8.1, the Benefits accrued hereunder, prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment shall continue to be an obligation of the Company, and shall be paid not later than the date(s) provided hereunder immediately prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment; and provided further, without limitation, that, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals and with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals to the extent permitted by the Act without the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under the Act, such amounts may be paid earlier, with actuarial reductions based on the actuarial assumptions in the Qualified Plan, in the sole discretion of the Administrator.

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLAN AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005 Article I. Establishment and Purpose 1.1 Establishment. ABF Freight System, Inc. established the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "PLAN") effective as of January 1, 1992 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE"), and hereby amends and restates it (except as otherwise herein provided) as of January 1, 2005. 1.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Plan is to provide (i) a restoration of benefits of Category I Participants which were lost under the Qualified Plan (x) because of amendments which were adopted, and Statutory Limitations imposed, subsequent to 1985, and (y) by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP; and (ii) a restoration of benefits of Category II Participants which were lost under the Current Qualified Plan solely by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP. The purpose of this amendment and restatement of the Plan is to comply with the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") in order to avoid immediate taxation of amounts deferred hereunder, and the Plan will be interpreted accordingly. With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, the Plan shall be interpreted so as to avoid having such Pre-2005 Deferrals subject to the Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Plan shall be closed to new Participants from and after December 16, 2005; (ii) benefits payable to existing Category II Participants shall only take into account amounts deferred under the VSP (as defined below) on or before December 31, 2006; and (iii) the Benefits payable hereunder shall be subject to the maximum caps set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

(mm) "SPECIFIED EMPLOYEE" shall mean a "specified employee" of the Arkansas Best Corporation as defined in the Act.

2.3 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted, and the Company shall have the privilege and opportunity to correct and remedy such questions of illegality or invalidity by amendment as provided in the Plan. 2.4 Applicable Law. This Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas. 2.5 Plan Not an Employment Contract. This Plan is not an employment contract. It does not give to any person the right to be continued in employment, and all employees remain subject to change of salary, transfer, change of job, discipline, layoff, discharge, or any other change of employment status. Article III. Participation 3.1 Participation. Participation in this Plan shall be limited to those persons who are Participants on December 16, 2005. Article IV. Benefit and Payment 4.1 Benefit. (a) Benefits of Category I Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category I Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of (i) the benefits which would be payable to the Category I Participant under the Qualified Plan if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered (x) without regard to the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (y) without regard to the limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17)of the Code, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such person under the Current Qualified Plan, with the benefits in both (i) and (ii) being computed as of the date the Category I Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Without limitation, the amount described in "(i)" shall be determined as if the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation were amended by (iii) deleting all direct or indirect references to the provisions of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (iv) adding thereto a provision which would cause the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation to include all amounts which a Category I Participant shall contribute to the VSP as a Compensation Deferral Contribution (as defined in the VSP); and (v) applying the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation so as to reflect the historical intent and practice of excluding all income which the Company considered as not subject to FICA tax, including without limitation, the exclusion of all income from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Basic Benefits payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category I Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category I Participant solely under 7
the Qualified Plan had Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code not been applicable thereto, and had he not elected to make Compensation Deferral Contribution(s) as defined in the VSP; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any service or compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category I Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan with respect to service and compensation to the extent, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, he receives benefits with respect thereto under the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. (b) Benefit of Category II Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit. (c) Vesting Schedule. Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule: 1.67% vesting for each month of participation as a Category I Participant in the Plan The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested. 8
This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above. 4.2 Payment. Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 4.3 Funding. All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. 4.4 Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment. 4.5 Benefits are Not Compensation. No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such 9
Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control. 4.6 Nontransferability. A Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law other than by will or the laws of distribution or between spouses or incident to a divorce within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Code or any successor provision (provided any such permitted transfer shall remain subject to all other provisions of this Plan). Article V. Deferrals And Investments 5.1 Elections. Each Eligible Deferral Participant may file a Deferral Election form with the Administrator and become a Deferred Participant, provided such filing is made prior to his Final Election Date under Section 2(y)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant who desires to defer all or a portion of the Participant's Basic Benefit must file an initial Deferral Election form with the Administrator by December 31, 2006, or, if later, 30 days following the date the individual first becomes a Participant in the Plan; provided, however, that an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2006 may not (i) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2006, or (ii) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2006 that would not have otherwise been made in 2006. In addition, a Participant may file subsequent Deferral Election forms prior to the Final Election Date; provided, however, that with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, any subsequent Deferral Election, including any Deferral Election made by a Deferred Participant with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, (a) will not be effective until 12 months following the date the new Deferral Election form is filed, (b) must provide for the delay of the Deferral Payment Date for at least 5 additional years and (c) must not provide for the accelerated payment of any portion of such Post-2004 Deferrals. 5.2 Establishment of Deferral Account. The Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account for each Deferred Participant, (i) to which shall be added the deferred portion of such Deferred Participant's Basic Benefit effective not less than thirty (30) days after his Separation, (ii) to which shall be added (or deducted) Earnings, and (iii) from which shall be deducted Deferred Payments. 5.3 Earnings Added to Deferral Accounts. Earnings shall be added to each Deferral Account based on the Deferred Participant's Measurement Preference as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application. 5.4 Investment Direction. Effective as of each Business Day, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Deferred Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator. No actual investments shall be made by Deferred Participants. The Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Company's payment 10
obligation under Article VI and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Company. A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved. 5.5 No Guaranty of Deferral. While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form. 5.6 Statements. As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period. Article VI. Distributions to Deferred Participants 6.1 Form of Deferred Payments. A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. 11
Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective. 6.2 Installment Payments. If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator. 6.3 Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder. 6.4 Hardship Distribution. Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or 12
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval. 6.5 Accelerated Withdrawal. A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals. Article VII. Administration 7.1 Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan. 7.2 Finality of Determination. The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons. 7.3 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company. 7.4 Indemnification and Exculpation. The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall 13
not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Article VIII. Merger, Amendment, and Termination 8.1 Merger, Consolidation. In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act. 8.2 Claims Procedure. The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator. On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal. If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render 14
its final decision. The Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Company, through written resolution, appoints another agent. 8.3 Securities Laws. The Plan intends to comply with and be exempt under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Deferred Participants under the Plan are final purchasers and not underwriters or conduits to other beneficial owners or subsequent purchasers. 8.4 Amendment and Termination. The Company, through its Board of Directors, may in its discretion amend the Plan from time-to-time. Specifically, termination of the Plan shall require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby delegates to its executive officers the authority to make any amendment (i) that does not increase the benefit costs of the Plan to the Company by more than 1% of the Plan's prior calendar year financial statement expense or (ii) that is necessary or desirable in order to have it conform to the provisions and requirements of the Code, AJCA or any other applicable law. In the event of an amendment or termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section or Section 8.1, the Benefits accrued hereunder, prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment shall continue to be an obligation of the Company, and shall be paid not later than the date(s) provided hereunder immediately prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment; and provided further, without limitation, that, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals and with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals to the extent permitted by the Act without the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under the Act, such amounts may be paid earlier, with actuarial reductions based on the actuarial assumptions in the Qualified Plan, in the sole discretion of the Administrator.

DATA-TRONICS SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLAN AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005 Article I. Establishment and Purpose 1.1 Establishment. Data-Tronics Corp. established the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "PLAN") effective as of January 1, 1992 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE"), and hereby amends and restates it (except as otherwise herein provided) as of January 1, 2005. 1.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Plan is to provide (i) a restoration of benefits of Category I Participants which were lost under the Qualified Plan (x) because of amendments which were adopted, and Statutory Limitations imposed, subsequent to 1985, and (y) by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP; and (ii) a restoration of benefits of Category II Participants which were lost under the Current Qualified Plan solely by reason of voluntary contributions to the VSP. The purpose of this amendment and restatement of the Plan is to comply with the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") in order to avoid immediate taxation of amounts deferred hereunder, and the Plan will be interpreted accordingly. With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, the Plan shall be interpreted so as to avoid having such Pre-2005 Deferrals subject to the Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Plan shall be closed to new Participants from and after December 16, 2005; (ii) benefits payable to existing Category II Participants shall only take into account amounts deferred under the VSP (as defined below) on or before December 31, 2006; and (iii) the Benefits payable hereunder shall be subject to the maximum caps set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

It does not give to any person the right to be continued in employment, and all employees remain subject to change of salary, transfer, change of job, discipline, layoff, discharge, or any other change of employment status. Article III. Participation 3.1 Participation. Participation in this Plan shall be limited to those persons (i) who are Participants on December 16, 2005. Article IV. Benefit and Payment 4.1 Benefit. (a) Benefits of Category I Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category I Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of (i) the benefits which would be payable to the Category I Participant under the Qualified Plan if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered (x) without regard to the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (y) without regard to the limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17)of the Code, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such person under the Current Qualified Plan, with the benefits in both (i) and (ii) being computed as of the date the Category I Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Without limitation, the amount described in "(i)" shall be determined as if the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation were amended by (iii) deleting all direct or indirect references to the provisions of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (iv) adding thereto a provision which would cause the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation to include all amounts which a Category I Participant shall contribute to the VSP as a Compensation Deferral Contribution (as defined in the VSP); and (v) applying the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation so as to reflect the historical intent and practice of excluding all income which the Company considered as not subject to FICA tax, including without limitation, the exclusion of all income from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Basic Benefits payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category I Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category I Participant solely under 7
the Qualified Plan had Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code not been applicable thereto, and had he not elected to make Compensation Deferral Contribution(s) as defined in the VSP; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any service or compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category I Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan with respect to service and compensation to the extent, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, he receives benefits with respect thereto under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. (b) Benefit of Category II Participants. The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit. (c) Vesting Schedule. Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule: 1.67% vesting for each month of participation as a Category I Participant in the Plan The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting 8
schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested. This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above. 4.2 Payment. Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 4.3 Funding. All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. 4.4 Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment. 9
4.5 Benefits are Not Compensation. No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control. 4.6 Nontransferability. A Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law other than by will or the laws of distribution or between spouses or incident to a divorce within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Code or any successor provision (provided any such permitted transfer shall remain subject to all other provisions of this Plan). Article V. Deferrals And Investments 5.1 Elections. Each Eligible Deferral Participant may file a Deferral Election form with the Administrator and become a Deferred Participant, provided such filing is made prior to his Final Election Date under Section 2(y)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant who desires to defer all or a portion of the Participant's Basic Benefit must file an initial Deferral Election form with the Administrator by December 31, 2006, or, if later, 30 days following the date the individual first becomes a Participant in the Plan; provided, however, that an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2006 may not (i) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2006, or (ii) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2006 that would not have otherwise been made in 2006. In addition, a Participant may file subsequent Deferral Election forms prior to the Final Election Date; provided, however, that with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, any subsequent Deferral Election, including any Deferral Election made by a Deferred Participant with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, (a) will not be effective until 12 months following the date the new Deferral Election form is filed, (b) must provide for the delay of the Deferral Payment Date for at least 5 additional years and (c) must not provide for the accelerated payment of any portion of such Post-2004 Deferrals. 5.2 Establishment of Deferral Account. The Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account for each Deferred Participant, (i) to which shall be added the deferred portion of such Deferred Participant's Basic Benefit effective not less than thirty (30) days after his Separation, (ii) to which shall be added (or deducted) Earnings, and (iii) from which shall be deducted Deferred Payments. 5.3 Earnings Added to Deferral Accounts. Earnings shall be added to each Deferral Account based on the Deferred Participant's Measurement Preference as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application. 5.4 Investment Direction. Effective as of each Business Day, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Deferred Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator. No actual investments shall be made by Deferred Participants. The 10
Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Company's payment obligation under Article VI and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Company. A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved. 5.5 No Guaranty of Deferral. While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form. 5.6 Statements. As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period. Article VI. Distributions to Deferred Participants 6.1 Form of Deferred Payments. A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. 11
Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective. 6.2 Installment Payments. If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator. 6.3 Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder. 6.4 Hardship Distribution. Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or 12
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval. 6.5 Accelerated Withdrawal. A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals. Article VII. Administration 7.1 Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan. 7.2 Finality of Determination. The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons. 7.3 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company. 7.4 Indemnification and Exculpation. The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall 13
not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Article VIII. Merger, Amendment, and Termination 8.1 Merger, Consolidation. In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act. 8.2 Claims Procedure. The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator. On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal. If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render 14
its final decision. The Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Company, through written resolution, appoints another agent. 8.3 Securities Laws. The Plan intends to comply with and be exempt under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Deferred Participants under the Plan are final purchasers and not underwriters or conduits to other beneficial owners or subsequent purchasers. 8.4 Amendment and Termination. The Company, through its Board of Directors, may in its discretion amend the Plan from time-to-time. Specifically, termination of the Plan shall require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby delegates to its executive officers the authority to make any amendment (i) that does not increase the benefit costs of the Plan to the Company by more than 1% of the Plan's prior calendar year financial statement expense or (ii) that is necessary or desirable in order to have it conform to the provisions and requirements of the Code, AJCA or any other applicable law. In the event of an amendment or termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section or Section 8.1, the Benefits accrued hereunder, prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment shall continue to be an obligation of the Company, and shall be paid not later than the date(s) provided hereunder immediately prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment; and provided further, without limitation, that, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals and with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals to the extent permitted by the Act without the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under the Act, such amounts may be paid earlier, with actuarial reductions based on the actuarial assumptions in the Qualified Plan, in the sole discretion of the Administrator.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On April 24, 2006, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2006 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings to non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because they provide more comparable measures of earnings. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 24, 2006)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced first quarter 2006 net income of $6.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted common share, compared to first quarter 2005 net income of $10.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share. Excluding a previously disclosed after-tax settlement accounting charge of $5.1 million ($0.20 per diluted common share) related to distributions from Arkansas Best's unfunded supplemental pension benefit plan, first quarter 2006 earnings per diluted common share were $0.44.
     Arkansas Best's revenue during the first quarter of 2006 was $450.6 million, a per-day increase of 8.0% over the first quarter of 2005.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System had first quarter 2006 revenue of $413.7 million, a per-day increase of 7.7% compared to first quarter 2005 revenue of $384.1 million. First quarter 2006 operating income at ABF was $8.4 million compared to $17.2 million during the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the settlement accounting charge, ABF's operating income was $16.8 million. ABF's first quarter 2006 operating ratio was 98.0% versus an operating ratio of 95.5% during the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the settlement accounting charge, ABF's operating ratio was 95.9%.
     ABF's total weight per day increased by 4.4% during the first quarter of 2006 versus the first quarter of 2005. "Although ABF's tonnage increase in the first quarter was adequate, we are not satisfied with this result," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "First quarter tonnage comparisons between this year and last year are improved by the fact that the Easter holiday occurred in the first quarter of 2005 and occurred in the second quarter of 2006. When adjusted for the Easter effect, ABF's total tonnage per day increased a little over 3%."
 
     Through the first twenty days of April, average daily tonnage figures in ABF's total business are about 1.5% above last year. "Adjusted for the Easter effect, April tonnage, to this point, is approximately 4% over the same period last year," said Mr. Davidson.
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $23.83, an increase of 4.1% over last year's first quarter figure of $22.90. Total billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 1.1%. During the first quarter of 2006, ABF continued to experience significant and positive freight profile changes that dampened the nominal revenue per hundredweight. For instance, ABF's first quarter 2006 total weight per shipment increased by 3.4% versus the same period last year. First quarter 2006 total length of haul declined by 1.8% compared to the first quarter of 2005. Both higher weight per shipment and shorter length of haul reduce the revenue per hundredweight without a commensurate impact on effective pricing or shipment profitability.
     "Consistent with a trend seen during the last few years, ABF experienced higher growth in the segment of shipments moving 800 miles or less. This trend illustrates the significant opportunities for ABF as we refine our marketing and operations to further penetrate the faster-growing regional markets, which already account for over one-third of ABF's tonnage," said Mr. Davidson. "Our limited trial of new operating procedures in 13 Northeastern facilities has been successful but these additional next-day and same-day regional shipments do not yet have a material impact on ABF's system results."
     In the first quarter of 2006, ABF's costs were adversely impacted by additional expense recognition associated with workers' compensation claims related to ABF's annual review of the development factors it uses to project the expected future cost of existing claims. Since 1999, ABF has used ten years of its claims history to calculate the appropriate claims development factors. However, this year's review indicated ABF was experiencing claim development beyond ten years and that this development should be considered in the factors. As a result, Arkansas Best and its independent actuary concluded that thirteen years of claims history data was appropriate to use for calculating the claims development factors. This change caused ABF's first quarter 2006 workers' compensation costs to increase by $2.5 million and added 0.6% to ABF's operating ratio.
 
     "Productivity statistics, as measured by total weight per labor hour, increased by 2.4% during this year's first quarter. These productivity improvements were primarily the result of the increase in ABF's total weight per shipment," said Mr. Davidson. "The larger shipments require more labor, but the weight per hour is greater. As with ABF's growing family of value-added specialty services that require more pickup, delivery and dock labor, the additional revenue results in improved profitability."
Clipper
     Clipper's first quarter 2006 revenue was $25.7 million, a 9.5% increase over first quarter 2005 revenue of $23.5 million. Clipper's first quarter 2006 operating ratio was 98.0% compared to a 2005 first quarter operating ratio of 100.1%. Clipper's first quarter 2006 operating income was approximately $506,000 compared to a first quarter 2005 operating loss of approximately $23,000.
     "Clipper had its best first quarter operating income and operating ratio since 1996. We are pleased with these results in the historically-challenging first quarter," said Mr. Davidson. "Each of Clipper's divisions experienced year-over-year quarterly revenue increases. For instance, revenue in Clipper's temperature-controlled division increased by 20.1% during their off-season," said Mr. Davidson. "This unusual revenue increase came from produce and non-produce products requiring temperature protection," said Mr. Davidson. "We are pleased with Clipper's strong first quarter performance."
Stock-Based Compensation
     On April 17, 2006, Arkansas Best Corporation granted 192,500 shares of restricted stock under its 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board requires that the fair value of stock options be expensed. Arkansas Best issued stock options through 2004 and is now required to expense the fair value of its unvested stock options over the remaining vesting period. Arkansas Best's first quarter 2006 expense from stock options and restricted stock grants was $1.1 million or $0.03 per diluted common share, net of taxes. Arkansas Best had no expenses for stock options or restricted stock in the first quarter of 2005. For the full year of 2006, Arkansas Best estimates its expense from stock options and restricted stock grants to be approximately $4.3 million or $0.10 per diluted common share, net of taxes. In 2005, restricted stock expense was $842,467, or $0.02 per diluted common share, net of taxes.
 
Nonunion Pension and Supplemental Pension Benefits
     Arkansas Best's nonunion pension expense will be $11.6 million for the full year 2006. This compares to full year 2005 pension expense of $10.0 million. Arkansas Best will use 7.9% as its 2006 investment return assumption and 5.5% as its discount rate assumption for 2006 plan liabilities. These rates compare to 8.3% for investment returns and a 5.5% discount rate for plan liabilities for 2005.
     Arkansas Best has an unfunded supplemental pension benefit plan for the purpose of providing supplemental retirement benefits to executive officers of the company. As previously disclosed, distributions of benefits to retiring officers and previously retired officers who deferred payments until 2006 were made in the first quarter of 2006 and will be made in the third quarter of 2006. Under FASB Statement No. 88, Arkansas Best is required to record a "pension accounting settlement" charge when cash payouts exceed annual service and interest costs of the related plan. As a result of this required settlement accounting, in the first quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best recorded a pre-tax charge of $8.4 million or $0.20 per diluted common share, net of taxes. For the third quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best anticipates recording another pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million or between $0.02 and $0.04 per diluted common share, net of taxes. Although Arkansas Best anticipates having future benefit distributions that could require settlement accounting charges, such future charges should be much less significant to Arkansas Best's financial results than the 2006 amounts. Effective December 16, 2005, Arkansas Best's supplemental pension benefit plan was closed to new participants, and new executive officers will participate in a three-year, performance-based plan.
Common Stock Purchase
     During the first quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best made open-market purchases, totaling 100,000 shares, of its common stock. The total purchase price for these transactions was $4.3 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since January 2003, Arkansas Best has purchased a total of 943,150 shares totaling $29.3 million. Under a program announced in July 2005, Arkansas Best currently has authorization to purchase up to an additional $45.7 million of its common stock. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.

     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2006 first quarter results. The call will be today, Monday, April 24, at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 24, 2006)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2006 net income of $32.3 million, or $1.26 per diluted common share. Income from continuing operations was $29.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, compared to second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations of $22.6 million, or $0.88 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's second quarter 2006 revenue was $479.3 million, an increase of 12.0% over second quarter 2005 revenue of $427.9 million.
     As previously announced, in June 2006 Arkansas Best completed the sale of Clipper Exxpress, its former intermodal transportation subsidiary. Arkansas Best's discontinued operations include an after-tax gain on the sale of Clipper of $0.12 per common share, which is subject to adjustments based on the final closing balance sheet as of June 14, 2006. In addition, discontinued operations include after-tax income of $0.01 per common share associated with Clipper's second quarter operating results through the closing date.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System,Inc. had second quarter 2006 revenue of $466.9 million, a per-day increase of 11.8% over second quarter 2005 revenue of $417.5 million. Second quarter 2006 operating income at ABF was $46.4 million compared to $38.1 million during the second quarter of 2005. ABF's second quarter 2006 operating ratio was 90.1% versus an operating ratio of 90.9% in the second quarter of 2005. "During a period of healthy revenue and tonnage growth, the employees of ABF enhanced customer satisfaction levels and cargo care, further improving the industry's best loss and damage experience," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our balance of growth and disciplined yield management resulted in an improvement in ABF's operating profit and the best second quarter operating ratio in over twenty-eight years."
 
     ABF's second quarter 2006 total weight per day increased by 6.4% compared to last year. "ABF experienced solid tonnage increases throughout the quarter as the year-over-year increase in total tonnage grew during each successive month of the second quarter," said Mr. Davidson. "Second quarter tonnage comparisons were dampened slightly by the timing of the Easter holiday, just as they were helped in this year's first quarter. When adjusted for the Easter effect, ABF's second quarter total tonnage per day increased about 7%."
     "Our year-over-year tonnage trends in July are running at or slightly behind those of the second quarter, although comparisons for this short period are complicated by calendar differences," said Mr. Davidson.
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $25.22, an increase of 5.5% over last year's second quarter figure of $23.91. Total billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 1.9%. "The industry pricing environment is competitive but firm, consistent with recent quarters. The retention of the April 3rd general rate increase is in line with our expectations, and price increases on contract renewals are acceptable," said Mr. Davidson. During the second quarter of 2006, ABF continued to experience significant and positive freight profile changes that reduced the reported revenue per hundredweight. Compared to last year, ABF's second quarter 2006 total weight per shipment increased by 4.7% while total length of haul declined by 1.6%. The combination of higher weight per shipment and shorter length of haul reduce the reported revenue per hundredweight without a corresponding reduction in effective pricing or shipment profitability.
     "Once again, ABF experienced higher growth rates in freight traveling 800 miles or less. In this year's second quarter, this freight increased by 10.4% compared to last year. As in the past, most of these short-haul shipments are moving in existing network lanes," said Mr. Davidson. "In April of this year, ABF announced new operating procedures in 52 additional customer service facilities. As a result, ABF's more flexible regional capabilities are in place in nearly 25% of the locations in its network. In addition, these new regional operating procedures have improved reliability in longer haul lanes. ABF is beginning to market its new next-day and second-day services, branded as the Regional Performance Model or RPM, throughout the East Coast, from Maine to South Carolina. Despite the initial success ABF has experienced with these operational changes, resulting freight is not expected to have a meaningful impact on ABF's operating results until late this year or early 2007."
 
     "ABF's second quarter productivity, as measured by total weight per labor hour, improved by 1.8% compared to last year's second quarter. During the quarter, this productivity figure was at its highest level since the third quarter of last year. "Freight-handling productivity continues to be positively impacted by increases in ABF's total weight per shipment," said Mr. Davidson. "While freight-handling productivity has improved, ABF has continued to maintain one of the best cargo claims ratios in the LTL industry. During the second quarter, ABF's cargo claim ratio, a measure of net cash payouts to revenue, was 0.67%. This compares to ABF's cargo claims ratio of 0.78% for the combined years of 2004 and 2005. Also, as we expected, ABF's year-to-date workers' compensation expenses as a percent of revenue returned to historical levels."
Common Stock Purchase
     During the second quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best purchased 200,000 shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $8.3 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since January 2003, Arkansas Best has purchased 1,143,150 shares totaling $37.6 million. Under a program announced in July 2005, Arkansas Best currently has authorization to purchase up to an additional $37.4 million of its common stock. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 23, 2006, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2006 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures of earnings and earnings per share. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because they provide a more comparable measure of earnings and earnings per share. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 23, 2006)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2006 revenue of $507.3 million, an 11.2% per-day increase versus $463.3 million from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $1.24 per diluted share compared to $1.58 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding a previously disclosed after-tax settlement accounting charge of $0.02 per share, earnings were $1.26 per diluted share. This was an improvement of $0.06 per share over third quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations of $1.20 per diluted share, after adjusting for a $0.38 per share gain on the sale of properties to G.I. Trucking Company.
     "ABF's third quarter operating ratio, excluding the settlement accounting charge, was in the eighties for only the fourth time in the last thirty-five years," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "As a result, for the past twelve-month period, Arkansas Best's After-Tax Return on Capital Employed was 17% and our company's balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the transportation industry."
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     "During this year's third quarter, ABF experienced a healthy balance of tonnage growth and yield increases that produced a successful quarter," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF's total tonnage per day increased by 2.5%. Total tonnage would have been higher if we had not reduced spot volume tonnage with higher prices during the third quarter. Total billed revenue per hundredweight without fuel surcharge increased by 3.1% which included yield improvement and the impact of profile changes."
     ABF had third quarter 2006 revenue of $493.7 million, a per-day increase of 11.0% compared to third quarter 2005 revenue of $451.8 million. Third quarter 2006 operating income at ABF, excluding the settlement accounting charge, was $50.5 million compared to $52.0 million in the third quarter of 2005. ABF's third quarter 2006 operating ratio was 89.8%, after
 
adjusting for the settlement accounting charge, versus an operating ratio of 88.5% during the third quarter of 2005.
     "ABF's quarterly operating ratio wasn't quite as good as the superior number that we posted in the third quarter of last year, but it still reflected an excellent result," Davidson continued. "In the third quarter of this year, ABF took aggressive steps to improve service levels to customers. In addition to reducing spot volume tonnage, ABF has added approximately 2,000 new employees throughout its network, resulting in a net increase of over 750 in ABF's total employee count since the first of the year. The additional employees also allowed us to reduce our rail usage and thus increase the amount of freight moving in ABF's linehaul network. This successful recruiting effort will also position ABF for future growth, especially as we expand in the regional markets."
     "ABF's productivity statistics, as measured by total weight per labor hour, declined by 4.3% during this year's third quarter. This was only partially explained by ABF's reduction in larger shipments," said Mr. Davidson. "As we have seen in the past, the addition of a large number of employees resulted in an initial reduction of productivity. When these costs are combined with the costs of improvements in customer service levels, ABF's third quarter operating ratio increased by nearly a point. Our past experience suggests that productivity will improve as the new employees gain experience."
     Since the end of the third quarter, the percentage change in ABF's total tonnage per day is running in the mid-to-high single digits below the same period last year. Excluding the impact of reductions in spot volume tonnage that ABF continues to experience, the percentage change in early October tonnage is flat to down in the low, mid-single digits compared to the same period last year. "In early October, ABF began to experience a slowdown in freight tonnage that appears to be related mostly to retail customers who have delayed the timing of normal holiday orders," said Mr. Davidson. "In addition, based on the continuing decline of ABF's spot volume tonnage, we suspect that this slowdown is related to softness in the truckload market."
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $25.91, an increase of 6.1% when compared to $24.43 in the third quarter of 2005. Total billed revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased by 3.1%. "During the third quarter, ABF secured good increases in a pricing environment that is competitive, yet rational," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF has a continued focus on obtaining necessary price increases on its base freight rates, especially as fuel prices and
 
related surcharges decline," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF will maintain its overall pricing philosophy of focusing on individual account profitability."
     In August, ABF began marketing its Regional Performance Model or RPM which provides improved next-day and second-day services throughout the East Coast. Beginning in October, ABF has expanded its RPM operation to include most facilities in the eastern two-thirds of the United States. New RPM linehaul operating models that are separate from and parallel to those of ABF's national linehaul network are being developed. Once all of these are in place in November, ABF will be offering RPM service in 220 of its 288 systemwide facilities. "The initial RPM operations are going well, and ABF is adding new employees and making capital investments in equipment to support this initiative. Our sales and operations employees are excited about the additional business and growth opportunities in RPM," said Mr. Davidson. "It is important to remember, however, that business development in these new lanes will occur gradually over time. We do not expect these RPM shipments to have a meaningful impact on our system revenue totals until sometime in 2007."
     "We anticipate fourth quarter operating ratio deterioration of as much as a percentage point related to continuing investments in ABF's RPM initiative," said Mr. Davidson. "Though establishment of the RPM network will require initial costs and investments that may adversely affect our current results, ABF is firmly committed to this new market and we expect it to provide significant future long-term growth opportunities. Fortunately, our strong balance sheet, considerable cash reserves and ABF's flexibility in offering value to the marketplace allow us to be patient while establishing a new service like RPM."
Common Stock Purchase
     During the third quarter of 2006, Arkansas Best purchased 100,000 shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $4.2 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since January 2003, Arkansas Best has purchased 1,243,150 shares totaling $41.7 million. Under a program announced in July 2005, Arkansas Best currently has authorization to purchase up to an additional $33.3 million of its common stock. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.
 
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued Statement No. 158, which requires the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to be recognized in the balance sheet. As a result of adjusting liabilities to record the funded status of Arkansas Best's plans, previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs will be recognized, net of deferred taxes, within a component of stockholders' equity. Actual results and assumptions used to determine the funded status of the company's plans will vary. Based on current information, Arkansas Best's stockholders' equity is estimated to be reduced, net of deferred taxes, by approximately $40 million at December 31, 2006 due to the new accounting standard.
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2006 third quarter results. The call will be today, Monday, October 23, at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257 or (706) 634-6529 (for international callers).

Benefit
     (a) . The Basic Benefits payable to a Category I Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of (i) the benefits which would be payable to the Category I Participant under the Qualified Plan if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered (x) without regard to the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (y) without regard to the limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17)of the Code, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such person under the Current Qualified Plan, with the benefits in both (i) and (ii) being computed as of the date the Category I Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Without limitation, the amount described in "(i)" shall be determined as if the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation were amended by (iii) deleting all direct or indirect references to the provisions of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (iv) adding thereto a provision which would cause the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation to include all amounts which a Category I Participant shall contribute to the VSP as a Compensation Deferral Contribution (as defined in the VSP); and (v) applying the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation so as to reflect the historical intent and practice of excluding all income which the Company considered as not subject to FICA tax, including without limitation, the exclusion of all income from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock.

Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan.
     (b) . The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit.
Benefit of Category II Participants
     (c) . Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule:
Vesting Schedule
The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested.
 
This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above.
     4.2 . Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
Payment
     4.3 . All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any trust agreement to the contrary, in no even shall (i) assets of the Company or any affiliate be set aside or reserved (directly or indirectly) in a trust or transferred to such a trust for purposes of paying deferred amounts and earnings thereon for an "applicable covered employee" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(D)(1) of the Code) under the plan during any "restricted period" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(B) of the Code), or (ii) any assets of the Company, any affiliate or any trust described in this paragraph become restricted to the provision of benefits under the Plan in connection with a "restricted period" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(B) of the Code); in each case, unless otherwise permitted under Section 409A(b)(3) of the Code without the imposition of the additional tax set forth in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.
Funding
 
     4.4 . The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.
Tax Withholding
     4.5 . No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control.
Benefits are Not Compensation
     4.6 . A Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law other than by will or the laws of distribution or between spouses or incident to a divorce within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Code or any successor provision (provided any such permitted transfer shall remain subject to all other provisions of this Plan).
Nontransferability
     5.1 . Each Eligible Deferral Participant may file a Deferral Election form with the Administrator and become a Deferred Participant, provided such filing is made prior to his Final Election Date under Section 2(y)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant who desires to defer all or a portion of the Participant's Basic Benefit must file an initial Deferral Election form with the Administrator by December 31, 2007, or, if later, 30 days following the date the individual first becomes a Participant in the Plan; provided, however, that (i) an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2006 may not (A) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2006, or (B) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2006 that would not have otherwise been made in 2006 and (ii) an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2007 may not (A) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2007, or (B) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2007 that would not have otherwise been made in 2007. In addition, a Participant may file subsequent Deferral Election forms prior to the Final Election Date; provided, however, that with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, any subsequent Deferral Election, including any Deferral Election made by a Deferred Participant with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, (a) will not be effective until 12 months following the date the new Deferral Election form is filed, (b) must provide for the delay of the Deferral Payment Date for at least 5 additional years and (c) must not provide for the accelerated payment of any portion of such Post-2004 Deferrals.
Elections
     5.2 . The Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account for each Deferred Participant, (i) to which shall be added the deferred portion of such Deferred Participant's Basic Benefit effective not less than thirty (30) days after his Separation, (ii) to which shall be added (or deducted) Earnings, and (iii) from which shall be deducted Deferred Payments.
Establishment of Deferral Account
 
     5.3 . Earnings shall be added to each Deferral Account based on the Deferred Participant's Measurement Preference as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application.
Earnings Added to Deferral Accounts
     5.4 . Effective as of each Business Day, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Deferred Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator. No actual investments shall be made by Deferred Participants. The Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Company's payment obligation under Article VI and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Company.
Investment Direction
     A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form.
     Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved.
     5.5 . While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form.
No Guaranty of Deferral
     5.6 . As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period.
Statements
 
     6.1 . A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective.
Form of Deferred Payments
     6.2 . If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator.
Installment Payments
     6.3 . Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
Change in Control
     6.4 . Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other
Hardship Distribution
 
similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval.
     6.5 . A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals.
Accelerated Withdrawal
     7.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan.
Administration
     7.2 . The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.
Finality of Determination
     7.3 . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.
Expenses
     7.4 . The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and
Indemnification and Exculpation
 
held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
     8.1 . In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act.
Merger, Consolidation
     8.2 . The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator.
Claims Procedure

     (b) . The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the Data-Tronics Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit.
Benefit of Category II Participants
     (c) . Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule:
Vesting Schedule
The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided
 
such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested.
This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above.
     4.2 . Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
Payment
     4.3 . All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any trust agreement to the contrary, in no event shall (i) assets of the Company or any affiliate be set aside or reserved (directly or indirectly) in a trust or transferred to such a trust for purposes of paying deferred amounts and earnings thereon for an "applicable covered employee" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(D)(1) of the Code) under the Plan during any "restricted period" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(B) of the Code), or (ii) any assets of the Company, any affiliate or any trust described in this

     4.4 . The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.
Tax Withholding
     4.5 . No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control.
Benefits are Not Compensation

     A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form.
     Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved.
     5.5 . While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form.
No Guaranty of Deferral
 
     5.6 . As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period.
Statements
     6.1 . A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective.
Form of Deferred Payments
     6.2 . If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator.
Installment Payments
     6.3 . Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
Change in Control
 
     6.4 . Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval.
Hardship Distribution
     6.5 . A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals.
Accelerated Withdrawal
     7.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan.

     7.2 . The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the
Finality of Determination
 
vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.
     7.3 . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.
Expenses
     7.4 . The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Indemnification and Exculpation
     8.1 . In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act.
Merger, Consolidation
     8.2 . The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information
Claims Procedure
 
necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator.
     On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal. If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render its final decision. The Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
     The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Company, through written resolution, appoints another agent.
     8.3 . The Plan intends to comply with and be exempt under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Deferred Participants under the Plan are final purchasers and not underwriters or conduits to other beneficial owners or subsequent purchasers.

Amendment and Termination

The Basic Benefits payable to a Category I Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of (i) the benefits which would be payable to the Category I Participant under the Qualified Plan if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered (x) without regard to the maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (y) without regard to the limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17)of the Code, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such person under the Current Qualified Plan, with the benefits in both (i) and (ii) being computed as of the date the Category I Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Without limitation, the amount described in "(i)" shall be determined as if the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation were amended by (iii) deleting all direct or indirect references to the provisions of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (iv) adding thereto a provision which would cause the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation to include all amounts which a Category I Participant shall contribute to the VSP as a Compensation Deferral Contribution (as defined in the VSP); and (v) applying the Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation so as to reflect the historical intent and practice of excluding all income which the Company considered
Benefits of Category I Participants
 
as not subject to FICA tax, including without limitation, the exclusion of all income from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Basic Benefits payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category I Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category I Participant solely under the Qualified Plan had Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code not been applicable thereto, and had he not elected to make Compensation Deferral Contribution(s) as defined in the VSP; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any service or compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category I Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan with respect to service and compensation to the extent, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, he receives benefits with respect thereto under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan.
     (b) . The Basic Benefits payable to a Category II Participant under this Plan shall be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the excess, if any, of the benefits which would be payable to the Category II Participant (i) under the Current Qualified Plan, if the Current Qualified Plan's definition of Compensation (without limitation, determined by the application described in Section 4.1 (a)(v)) included the Special Restored Compensation, if any, of such Category II Participant, over (ii) the benefits which are actually payable to such Category II Participant under the Current Qualified Plan, with both benefits being computed as of the date the Category II Participant Separates, but in no event, when combined with the Participant's Deferred Benefit, more than the maximum amount specified in Exhibit B hereto for such Participant's employment classification. Basic Benefits of each Category II Participant payable under this Plan shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing, and with the objective that, subject to the maximum Benefit caps specified in Exhibit B hereto, the Category II Participant should receive under this Plan and the Current Qualified Plan that total amount which would have been payable to the Category II Participant solely under the Current Qualified Plan (calculated, without limitation, by recognizing and applying the limitations of Section 415 and Section 401(a)(17) of the Code) if he had not incurred a Compensation Deferral Contribution as defined in the VSP on or before December 31, 2006; provided, however, that it is not intended that there be any Special Restored Compensation credited under more than one supplemental benefit plan and no Category II Participant shall receive Basic Benefits from this Plan to the extent he receives benefits under the ABF Freight System, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan or the Arkansas Best Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. In addition, amounts contributed to the VSP on or after January 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account in determining a Category II Participant's Basic Benefit.
Benefit of Category II Participants
     (c) . Subject to the following provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable to any Participant who becomes a Category I Participant after January 22, 2003, shall be subject to the following vesting schedule:
Vesting Schedule
 
The determination of a Participant's vested benefits shall be calculated on a monthly basis for a period up to sixty (60) months (with the last month equal to 1.47%), provided such Participant continues to be a Category I Participant in the Plan. The vesting schedule shall not apply to Category I Participants who became Category I Participants on or prior to January 22, 2003, such Participants shall be 100% vested.
This vesting schedule shall not apply to benefits earned by a Category II Participant; provided however, that in the event a Category I Participant becomes a Category II Participant, no further vesting in his or her Category I benefits shall occur. In the event a Category II Participant becomes a Category I Participant, all benefits earned while a Category II Participant shall remain 100% vested; however, any benefits earned as a Category I Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule described above.
     4.2 . Except as provided with respect to Deferred Participants (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), any Basic Benefit payable hereunder shall be paid to a Participant in the form of a single Lump Sum cash payment within a reasonable time after his date of Separation; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Specified Employee and Participant's Separation did not result from Participant's death or Disability, Participant's Post-2004 Deferrals may not be distributed until at least 6 months following his date of Separation. Any Participant shall have the right under this Plan, at any time prior to his death, to designate a Beneficiary, which may be different than the Beneficiary named under the Current Qualified Plan, for purposes of receiving Benefits under this Plan payable after his death, or to revoke or change such Beneficiary designation. In the event that a Participant wishes to exercise such right, he shall make his Beneficiary designation, revocation or change in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe. Such designation, revocation or change is only for purposes of the payment of death benefits that may be payable under this Plan. The designation of a different beneficiary for purposes of this Plan shall only affect the identity of the person or persons entitled to receive death benefits under this Plan; it shall not affect the amount of Benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall it affect the time or the form in which Benefits are payable hereunder. Moreover, if the Participant does not exercise his right to designate a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Plan, the Participant's Beneficiary under the Qualified Plan shall also be his Beneficiary under this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the death of a Deferred Participant, his or her Deferred Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
Payment
     4.3 . All amounts paid under this Plan shall be paid in cash from the general assets of the Company or from such funding vehicle, if any, as the Company shall establish for this purpose; provided, further, that all assets paid into any such funding vehicle shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the document(s) establishing such funding vehicle but which, in any event, shall at all times, prior to payment to a Participant, remain subject to the general creditors of the Company. The benefits restored hereunder, including any Deferred Benefits, shall be reflected on the accounting records of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship of any kind between the Company and a Participant or other person. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any trust agreement to the contrary, in no
Funding
 
event shall (i) assets of the Company or any affiliate be set aside or reserved (directly or indirectly) in a trust or transferred to such a trust for purposes of paying deferred amounts and earnings thereon for an "applicable covered employee" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(D)(1) of the Code) under the Plan during any "restricted period" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(B) of the Code), or (ii) any assets of the Company, any affiliate or any trust described in this paragraph become restricted to the provision of benefits under the Plan in connection with a "restricted period" (as defined in Section 409A(b)(3)(B) of the Code); in each case, unless otherwise permitted under Section 409A(b)(3) of the Code without the imposition of the additional tax set forth in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.
     4.4 . The Company may withhold or cause to be withheld from any Benefit payment any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.
Tax Withholding
     4.5 . No Benefit accrued or payable hereunder shall be deemed compensation to the Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which such Participant may be entitled under the Qualified Plan, the Current Qualified Plan, or any other retirement plan or arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees; provided, further, that in the event of a conflict with this Plan, the terms of each retirement plan or arrangement shall control.
Benefits are Not Compensation
     4.6 . A Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law other than by will or the laws of distribution or between spouses or incident to a divorce within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Code or any successor provision (provided any such permitted transfer shall remain subject to all other provisions of this Plan).
Nontransferability
     5.1 . Each Eligible Deferral Participant may file a Deferral Election form with the Administrator and become a Deferred Participant, provided such filing is made prior to his Final Election Date under Section 2(y)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant who desires to defer all or a portion of the Participant's Basic Benefit must file an initial Deferral Election form with the Administrator by December 31, 2007, or, if later, 30 days following the date the individual first becomes a Participant in the Plan; provided, however, that (i) an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2006 may not (A) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2006, or (B) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2006 that would not have otherwise been made in 2006, and (ii) an initial Deferral Election filed in the calendar year 2007 may not (A) defer the distribution of payments that would otherwise be payable in 2007, or (B) accelerate any payments into calendar year 2007 that would not have otherwise been made in 2007. In addition, a Participant may file subsequent Deferral Election forms prior to the Final Election Date; provided, however, that with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, any subsequent Deferral Election, including any Deferral Election made by a Deferred Participant with respect to
Elections
 
Post-2004 Deferrals, (a) will not be effective until 12 months following the date the new Deferral Election form is filed, (b) must provide for the delay of the Deferral Payment Date for at least 5 additional years and (c) must not provide for the accelerated payment of any portion of such Post-2004 Deferrals.
     5.2 . The Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account for each Deferred Participant, (i) to which shall be added the deferred portion of such Deferred Participant's Basic Benefit effective not less than thirty (30) days after his Separation, (ii) to which shall be added (or deducted) Earnings, and (iii) from which shall be deducted Deferred Payments.
Establishment of Deferral Account
     5.3 . Earnings shall be added to each Deferral Account based on the Deferred Participant's Measurement Preference as shall be determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rules of General Application.
Earnings Added to Deferral Accounts
     5.4 . Effective as of each Business Day, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Deferred Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Administrator. No actual investments shall be made by Deferred Participants. The Measurement Preferences are only for the purpose of determining the Company's payment obligation under Article VI and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments made by the Company.
Investment Direction
     A Deferred Participant may change his Measurement Preferences as of each Business Day by filing an Investment Election form with the Administrator who will review and determine whether such direction shall be forwarded, and if the Administrator elects to follow such direction, he shall notify the Third Party Recordkeeper. If a Deferred Participant has not filed an Investment Election form with respect to some or all of the amount in his Deferral Account, he will be deemed to have elected for such amount to be invested in the Money Market Fund until the first Business Day with respect to which he has designated an investment of such amount by filing an Investment Election form.
     Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Administrator shall have the power to reject some or all of the selections of Measurement Preferences selected by any one or more Deferred Participants by advising the affected Deferred Participant(s) in writing of such rejection within five (5) days of receiving an Investment Election form selecting or changing a Deferred Participant's Measurement Preferences. If the Administrator rejects as election, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the portion of such Deferral Account(s) subject to such rejection shall be credited with the Alternative Earnings Rate until a Measurement Preference is approved.
     5.5 . While the Company intends that the Deferral Election(s) will result in the deferral of the imposition of a federal income tax on the funds added to a Deferred Participant's Deferral Account until such time as they actually shall be paid to such Deferred Participant, nothing herein shall be construed as a promise, guarantee or other representation by the Company of such tax effect nor, without limitation, shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or other amounts incurred by any Eligible Deferral Participant(s) or
No Guaranty of Deferral
 
Deferred Participant(s) in the event it is determined by applicable authorities that such deferral was not accomplished, and each Participant who files an Election Form should consult his or her own tax advisor(s) to determine the tax consequences in his or her specific case, and their suitability for the filing of such Election Form.
     5.6 . As soon as reasonably possible following each Plan Year, and at such other times as determined by the Administrator under Rules of General Application, the Administrator shall furnish each Deferred Participant with a statement setting forth (i) the amount in his Deferral Account, (ii) the Earnings added or deducted from his Deferral Account for such period, and (iii) any deducted charges to, or distributions from, his Deferral Account during such period.
Statements
     6.1 . A Deferred Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time following the date on which they are first added to his Deferral Account, and may be paid on the date(s) designated and either in a Lump Sum or in up to fifteen (15) Installment Payments, in each case, as a Deferred Participant shall select on the Deferral Election in effect on the Final Election Date preceding the Deferred Payment Date of reference. Subject to Section 5.1, only the last Deferral Election form on or before such Final Election Date of reference shall be effective.
Form of Deferred Payments
     6.2 . If a Deferred Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to either (i) a fixed amount each year (not in excess of the balance of his Account at the time of the distribution), with the remaining balance of his Deferral Account distributed as the final installment; (ii) the product of (w) the balance of his Deferral Account on the payment date elected by the Participant in which such payment is made, multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid plus, in the case of the last Installment Payment, the remaining amount in his Deferral Account, or (iii) such other method as shall be (y) requested by the Deferred Participant on the Election Form of reference, and (z) approved by the Administrator in his sole discretion. Installment Payments shall be paid at such time during the Plan Year as shall be determined by the Administrator.
Installment Payments
     6.3 . Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change in Control, all Deferred Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Deferred Benefits otherwise payable on a later Deferred Payment Date, including, again without limitation, any remaining Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Deferred Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than thirty (30) days, after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change in Control, a Deferred Participant may elect to waive, with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals (but not Post-2004 Deferrals), the provisions of this Section 6.3 with respect to a designated Change in Control and continue to retain his Benefits under the Plan as if such Change in Control had not occurred. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, distributions under this Section 6.3 shall only be made upon the occurrence of Change in Control that qualifies as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective
Change in Control
 
control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
     6.4 . Upon the Administrator's determination (following petition by a Deferred Participant) that a Deferred Participant has suffered a "severe financial hardship, " the Administrator shall distribute to such Deferred Participant that portion of such Deferred Participant's Deferred Benefit as requested by such Deferred Participant and approved by the Administrator, but in no event shall the Administrator approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A "severe financial hardship" means an unforeseeable event resulting from a sudden and unexplained illness or accident experienced by either a Deferred Participant or his dependents, the loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond a Deferred Participant's control, which such Deferred Participant can not satisfy through available or attainable assets. Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home. The amount of the distribution will be limited to an amount necessary to satisfy the severe financial hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The Administrator shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request. A Deferred Participant shall receive a single lump-sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Administrator as soon as possible following the Administrator's approval.
Hardship Distribution
     6.5 . A Deferred Participant may request distribution of a portion (not less than $1,000) of that portion of his Deferred Benefit that relates to Pre-2005 Deferrals before its Deferred Payment Date. If such request is approved by the Administrator, which approval may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount equal to ten percent (10%)of the amount withdrawn shall be deducted from such Deferred Participant's Deferral Account and irrevocably forfeited. The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Company in the manner determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to Post-2004 Deferrals.
Accelerated Withdrawal
     7.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Company, who may delegate that responsibility to any one or more persons or committees. If more than one person is acting as Administrator, a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the members without a meeting, shall be the acts of the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the authority which is expressly stated in this Plan as vested in the Administrator, and authority to make rules to administer and interpret the Plan, to decide questions arising under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan.
Administration
 
     7.2 . The determination of the Administrator as to any disputed questions arising under this Plan, including questions of construction and interpretation shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons. Without limitation, the Board of Directors' determinations as to which persons are Category I Participants and Category II Participants, the specific benefits which shall be restored to each such Participant, and the vehicle, if any, to be used to fund such restorations of benefits shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.
Finality of Determination
     7.3 . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.
Expenses
     7.4 . The members of the Board of Directors, the Administrator, and officers, directors, and employees of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which they may be a party or in which they may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by them in settlement (with the Company's written approval) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding. The foregoing provision shall not be applicable to any person if the loss, cost, liability, or expense is due to such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Indemnification and Exculpation
     8.1 . In the event of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition where the Company is not the surviving corporation, this Plan will terminate unless the successor or acquiring corporation shall elect to continue and carry on the Plan; provided, however, that if the transaction does not qualify as either a "change in the ownership" of the Company, a "change in effective control" of the Company or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company, in each case, as defined under the Act or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder, such Plan termination shall not result in the acceleration of payment of any Post-2004 Deferral unless otherwise permitted under the Act.
Merger, Consolidation
     8.2 . The Administrator will make all determinations as to the rights of any employee, Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the terms of this Plan. Any employee, Participant, Beneficiary, or person claiming under them, may make a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing written notice with the Administrator setting forth the substance of the claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant will have the opportunity to appeal the denial upon filing with the Administrator a written request for review within 60 days after receipt of notice of denial. Denial of a claim or a decision on review will be made in writing the Administrator and delivered to the claimant within 60 days after receipt of the claim or request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim or review, in which event the such person's decision must be made as soon as possible thereafter but not beyond an additional 60 days. If no action on an initial claim is taken within 120 days, the claims will be deemed denied for purposes of permitting the claimant to proceed to the review stage. The denial of a claim or the decision on review will specify the reasons for the denial or decision , the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial or decision is based, a
Claims Procedure
 
description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of, \why such information is necessary, if applicable, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable thereto, including a statement of the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefits determination on review. The denial of a claim will also include a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of the claim review procedure herein described. Within 60 days after receiving a denial, the claimant or his authorized representative may appeal the decision by requesting a review by writing the Administrator.
     On appeal, the claimant may submit in writing any comments or issues with respect to the claim and/or any additional documents or information not considered during the initial review and, upon request and free of charge, the claimant will be provided access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. On appeal, the Administrator will not give deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. A decision on appeal will normally be given within 60 days after the receipt of the appeal. If special circumstances warrant an extension as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, then the decision will be made no later than 120 days after receipt of the appeal. If an extension is required, the claimant will be provided a written notice of the extension that shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render its final decision. The Administrator's decision on appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. If a claimant's appeal is denied in whole or in part, the notice of the decision on appeal shall include the specific reasons for the denial and reference to the relevant Plan provisions on which the denial was based, a statement that, upon request and free of charge, the claimant may review and copy all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits and the claimant's rights under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
     The Administrator will serve as an agent for service of legal process with respect to the Plan unless the Company, through written resolution, appoints another agent.
     8.3 . The Plan intends to comply with and be exempt under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Deferred Participants under the Plan are final purchasers and not underwriters or conduits to other beneficial owners or subsequent purchasers.
Securities Laws
     8.4 . The Company, through its Board of Directors, may in its discretion amend the Plan from time-to-time. Specifically, termination of the Plan shall require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby delegates to its executive officers the authority to make any amendment (i) that does not increase the benefit costs of the Plan to the Company by more than 1% of the Plan's prior calendar year financial statement expense or (ii) that is necessary or desirable in order to have it conform to the provisions and requirements of the Code, AJCA or any other applicable law.
Amendment and Termination
     In the event of an amendment or termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section or Section 8.1, the Benefits accrued hereunder, prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment shall continue to be an obligation of the Company, and shall be paid not later than the date(s) provided hereunder immediately prior to the later of the date of adoption, or the effective date, of the amendment; and provided further, without limitation, that,
 
with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals and with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals to the extent permitted by the Act without the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under the Act, such amounts may be paid earlier, with actuarial reductions based on the actuarial assumptions in the Qualified Plan, in the sole discretion of the Administrator.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized officers on day of , 2006.

ITEM 5.02  DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS
     On December 13, 2006 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") took the following actions:
2007 Annual Incentive Compensation Performance Measures
The Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards for 2007 under the Company's Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The 2007 performance measure is based on the return on capital employed ("ROCE") for each of the Company and ABF Freight System, Inc. The 2007 ROCE performance measure is substantially the same as in 2006. A minimum of 7% ROCE must be achieved for any incentive to be earned with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive. If the target ROCE, which is greater than the minimum, were achieved, the Company's President-CEO would receive $300,000 and each of the Company's and ABF's Senior Vice Presidents would receive $120,000 (based on their current Base Salary levels). The actual incentive earned in 2007 will depend on the final level of ROCE achieved and each Participant's Base Salary earned in 2007. The maximum amount any individual can earn under the Plan during the performance period is $2 million.
The Company's named executive officers participate in either the Company's or ABF's Annual Incentive Compensation Plan.
The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's annual stockholders meeting on April 20, 2005.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Company's stockholders approved the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan on April 20, 2005. Pursuant to such Ownership Incentive Plan, on December 13, 2006, the Committee established a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the"LTIP") for the three year measurement period of 2007-2009. The LTIP is comprised of two parts, an "ROCE Portion," which is given a 60% weighting, and a "Growth Portion," which is given a 40% weighting. The maximum amount any individual can earn under the 2007-2009 LTIP is $2 million.
On December 13, 2006, the Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards under the 2007-2009 LTIP. For the "ROCE Portion" the Committee determined that it would use the Company's three year average return on capital employed ("ROCE") as its performance measure and that a minimum of 7% ROCE must be achieved for any incentive to be earned with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive. The actual incentive earned in 2009 for the ROCE Portion will depend on the final three year average of ROCE achieved and the participants average Base Salary for 2007-2009 as defined in the LTIP.
Table of Contents
For the "Growth Portion" the Committee determined that the performance measure would be based on the Company achieving specified levels of increase in 2009 consolidated earnings per share over 2006 consolidated earnings per share expressed as a compounded annual growth rate for the measurement period. Each executive level has a predetermined target percentage of their average Base Salary for 2007-2009 as defined in the LTIP that is multiplied by a factor determined by the Growth Portion performance measure percentage achieved.
Eligible participants in the 2007-2009 LTIP are officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, ABF Freight System, Inc. or Data-Tronics Corp., who are not participants in the Company's Supplemental Benefit Plan ("SBP") or in the Deferred Salary Agreement ("DSA") program. Ten officers are expected to participate in the 2007-2009 LTIP. Two of the ten participants are named executive officers. The two named executive officers are Judy McReynolds, the Company's Senior Vice President-CFO and Chris Baltz, ABF's Senior Vice President  Yield Management and Strategic Development who entered into agreements amending each of their participation in the Company's SBP and DSA Agreements, effective December 18, 2006, to have their SBP and DSA benefits frozen as of January 31, 2008 and to commence participating in the Company's LTIP program in 2007 and thereafter.
If the ROCE and Growth targets were achieved, the two named executive officers would each receive $168,000 for the 2007-2009 measurement period.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On April 25, 2007, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2007 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations, because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 25, 2007)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced first quarter 2007 revenue of $422.6 million compared to $425.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. Arkansas Best's first quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was $4.8 million, or $0.19 a share, compared to $5.8 million, or $0.23 a share, in the first quarter of 2006. (See the "Supplemental Pension Benefits" section below for details regarding the impact of settlement accounting charges.)
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, the company's largest subsidiary, had first quarter 2007 revenue of $407.4 million, a per-day decrease of 1.5% compared to first quarter 2006 revenue of $413.7 million. First quarter 2007 operating income at ABF was $5.8 million compared to $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2006. ABF's first quarter 2007 operating ratio was 98.6% versus an operating ratio of 98.0% during the first quarter of 2006. ABF's total weight per day decreased by 5.8% during the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. In contrast, in the first quarter of 2006, ABF's total weight per day increased 4.4% versus the first quarter of 2005.
     "In October of 2006, ABF's tonnage declined significantly compared to the previous year. In November, when it became apparent that fourth quarter tonnage would be below expectations, ABF began reducing costs to better match available business levels. Those tonnage declines have continued into 2007. However, the expense reduction steps first initiated last November helped better align ABF's network with existing business. As a result, lower tonnage had less of an impact on ABF's operating ratio than we've seen in previous downturns or in the fourth quarter of 2006," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "As mentioned in previous quarters, investments in ABF's Regional Performance Model initiative increased ABF's first quarter operating ratio by 1.2 percentage points. Abnormally severe February weather also added about one-half of a percentage point to the first quarter 2007 operating ratio."
 
     Compared to the same period last year, ABF's first quarter 2007 operating ratio was improved by 0.7 of a percentage point due to lower expense associated with workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims. The combined costs of these programs in the first quarter of 2007 were in line, as a percent of revenue, with ABF's recent five-year average. In the first quarter of 2006, these costs were unusually high.
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $24.79, an increase of 4.0% over last year's first quarter figure of $23.83. The percentage increase in first quarter pricing was positively affected by profile changes in ABF's business, including a decrease in total weight per shipment and an increase in the shipment commodity class. "Considering the challenging freight demand that exists today, ABF has achieved acceptable price increases throughout its broad base of accounts. ABF continues to maintain its traditional pricing emphasis on individual account profitability," said Mr. Davidson. "Even during a period of reduced business, ABF will work to provide value to its customers in return for a level of revenue that yields acceptable operating margins."
     ABF's Regional Performance Model (RPM), which provides improved next-day and second-day services in the eastern two-thirds of the United States, is fully operational, and ABF's sales team is actively marketing these services. Because we are in the early stages of the marketing effort, RPM did not have a material impact on ABF's system revenue totals in the first quarter of 2007. "As we expected in the early stages of this new initiative, costs are exceeding associated revenues. As a result, for now, RPM continues to affect ABF's operating margins," said Mr. Davidson. "However, we believe that the opportunity for long-term growth of business and operating margins resulting from ABF's presence in the regional market is well worth the initial investments we are now making."
     "ABF is finding success with customers once they experience our services on these shorter-distance shipments and realize we are competitive in both delivery time consistency and price. In many cases, these customers appreciate ABF's high level of service, the problem-solving attitude of ABF's sales representatives and its superior cargo care. As these individual customer success stories continue to build, ABF's market share in the regional space should become more meaningful."
     During this year's first quarter, ABF's cargo claim ratio, a measure of net cash payouts to revenue, was 0.72%. This statistic reflects additional improvement when compared to the full year 2006 cargo claim ratio of 0.76%. During the first quarter, ABF handled 99.12% of its
 
shipments claim-free. Both of these measures are the best in the last twenty-five years. "A consistent record of excellence in cargo handling allows ABF to develop strong customer relationships that are based on superior value," said Mr. Davidson.
Supplemental Pension Benefits
     Arkansas Best has an unfunded supplemental pension benefit plan for the purpose of providing supplemental retirement benefits to certain executive officers of the company. As the result of officer retirements, distributions of benefits were made in the first quarter of 2007 and in the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, as a result of required pension settlement accounting, Arkansas Best recorded a charge of $1.1 million pre-tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, net of taxes. In the first quarter of 2006, settlement accounting charges were $8.4 million pre-tax, or $0.20 per diluted common share, net of taxes. Excluding the settlement accounting charges, ABF's first quarter 2007 operating ratio was 98.3% and ABF's first quarter 2006 operating ratio was 95.9%.
     Arkansas Best's supplemental pension benefit plan was closed to new entrants in late 2005. A majority of Arkansas Best's officers now participate, instead, in a new three-year, performance-based incentive plan.
Common Stock Purchase
     During the first quarter of 2007, Arkansas Best purchased 125,000 shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $4.9 million. These common shares were added to the company's treasury stock. Since January 2003, Arkansas Best has purchased 1,618,150 shares totaling $56.8 million. Under a program announced in July 2005, Arkansas Best currently has authorization to purchase up to an additional $18.2 million of its common stock. Arkansas Best plans to continue making open-market purchases of its stock on an opportunistic basis.

     WHEREAS, Participant is a member of the Board and is not employed by the Company or a Subsidiary;
     WHEREAS, the Company desires to encourage Participant to own Common Stock for the purposes stated in Section 1 of the Plan; and
     WHEREAS, Participant and the Company have entered into this Agreement to govern the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit Award (as defined below) granted to Participant by the Company.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Definitions
     Defined terms in the Plan shall have the same meaning in this Agreement, except where the context otherwise requires.
2. Grant of Restricted Stock Units
     On the Grant Date, the Company hereby grants to Participant an Award of ___ Restricted Stock Units (the "") in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan (as amended from time to time). Each Restricted Stock Unit subject to the Award represents the right to receive one Share (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Paragraph 14 hereof and/or Section 13 of the Plan) upon the terms and subject to the conditions (including the vesting conditions) set forth in this Agreement and the Plan.
Award
By accepting the Award, Participant irrevocably agrees on behalf of Participant and Participant's successors and permitted assigns to all of the terms and conditions of the Award as set forth in or pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan (as such Plan may be amended from time to time).
 
3. Vesting; Payment
     (a) The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. After the Grant Date, provided that Participant remains a member of the Board continuously through the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date (the ""), the Award shall become vested with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock Units on such Normal Vesting Date. In addition, prior to the Normal Vesting Date:
Normal Vesting Date
     (i) the Award shall become vested with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock Units on the first date on or after the 13-month anniversary of the Grant Date that Participant satisfies the requirements for Normal Retirement, as defined below, whether or not actual retirement or separation from service has occurred on that date
     (ii) on the first date on or after the 13-month anniversary of the Grant Date on which Participant satisfies the requirements for Early Retirement, as defined below whether or not actual retirement or separation from service has occurred on that date, the Award shall become vested with respect to the number of the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is equal to the number of full months between such date and the Grant Date, and (B) the denominator of which is 60, and the Award shall continue to vest on the fifteenth day of each subsequent month until the first day of the month in which Normal Vesting Date occurs with respect to an additional one-sixtieth of the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. No vesting will occur by virtue of Normal Retirement or Early Retirement prior to the 13-month anniversary of the Grant Date. In the month that the Normal Vesting Date occurs, all Units not previously vested shall become vested on the date of the month that corresponds to the Grant Date.
     For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Normal Retirement" shall mean Participant's retirement from service as a member of the Board on or after age 65 so long as Participant has, as of the date of such retirement, at least 5 years of service with the Company.
     For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Early Retirement" shall mean Participant's retirement from service as a member of the Board with at least 3 years of Board member service with the Company.
     Restricted Stock Units that have vested and are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture are referred to herein as "Vested Units." Restricted Stock Units that are not vested and generally remain subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as "Unvested Units."
     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 3, the Award shall be subject to earlier acceleration of vesting and/or forfeiture and transfer as provided in this Agreement and the Plan.
     (c) Subject to Paragraph 3(d) below, on the Normal Vesting Date, or, if earlier, the date Participant's service as a member of the Board terminates on or after he satisfied the requirements for accelerated vesting by virtue of qualifying for Normal Retirement or Early Retirement, Participant shall be entitled to receive one Share (subject to adjustment under
 
Section 13 of the Plan) for each Vested Unit in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. The Company will transfer such Shares to Participant or Participant's designee subject to (i) Participant's satisfaction of any required tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 7 and (ii) the restrictions, if any, imposed by the Company pursuant to Paragraph 15(f) or otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
     (d) Subject to the satisfaction of all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 7 below, Participant may irrevocably elect to defer the receipt of any Shares issuable pursuant to Vested Units, including Units distributable by reason of Sections 6(b) or (c), by submitting to the Company an election to defer receipt in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the ""). In the event Participant intends to defer the receipt of any Shares, Participant must submit to the Company a proposed Deferral Election Form within 30 days following the Grant Date of the Award. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Shares subject to Vested Units with respect to which a deferred payment date has been elected shall be immediately distributed to Participant or Participant's estate, as applicable, upon Participant's death or Disability (as defined below) or upon a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Company or in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company within the meanings ascribed to such terms in Treasury Department regulations or other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code. Participant hereby represents that he or she understands the effect of any such deferral under relevant federal, state and local tax laws.
Deferral Election Form
     (e) The date upon which Shares are to be issued under either Paragraph 3(c) or 3(d) is referred to as the "." The issuance of the Shares hereunder may be effected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant's behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company. Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.
Settlement Date
     Notwithstanding the above, prior to a Change in Control, (i) for administrative or other reasons, the Company may from time to time temporarily suspend the issuance of Shares in respect of earned Vested Units (whether or not deferred), (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares during any period when the Company determines that the delivery of Shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, and (iii) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters.
     Notwithstanding the delay for administrative or other reasons provided for in clauses (i) and (iii) above, in no event will such issuance of shares be delayed beyond the later of the end of the calendar year or the 15 day of the third month after the month in which the Settlement Date occurs, or such other time as permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder without the imposition of any additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code.
th
     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, this Agreement or the Deferral Election Form to the contrary, the Plan, this Agreement and the Deferral Election Form shall be construed or deemed to be amended as necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the imposition of any additional or accelerated taxes or other penalties under
 
Section 409A of the Code. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the requirements of Section 409A of the Code applicable to the Plan, this Agreement and the Deferral Election Form and shall interpret the terms of the Plan, this Agreement and the Deferral Election Form consistently therewith. Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any liability under the Plan, this Agreement or the Deferral Election Form for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Plan, this Agreement or the Deferral Election Form, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
4. Status of Participant
     Except as set forth in Paragraph 5, Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder (including, without limitation, any voting rights with respect to the Shares subject to the Award) with respect to either the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder or the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units, unless and until such Shares are issued in respect of Vested Units, and then only to the extent of such issued Shares.
5. Dividend Equivalents
     From and after the Grant Date and unless and until the Restricted Stock Units are forfeited or otherwise transferred back to the Company, Participant will be entitled to receive cash payments (subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Shares subject to this Award, which dividend equivalent payments shall be paid on or about the date such dividends or other distributions are payable to public stockholders, subject to any applicable tax withholding requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to any dividend or other distribution declared by the Company in connection with which the Award is adjusted pursuant to Paragraph 14 hereof and/or Section 13 of the Plan. For avoidance of doubt, this ineligibility for a dividend equivalent will apply only to the actual stock distribution in question (in the year of such distribution), and shall not adversely affect the ability to receive subsequent regular cash dividends on the Award as so adjusted.

Cause
Good Reason
     (e) . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any amounts that the Company determines to be deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if the Company determines that as of the Settlement Date Participant is a "specified employee" (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code), any such Shares to be issued to Participant on a Settlement Date that occurs by reason of Participant's termination of employment with the Company other by reason of Participant's death or Disability will not be issued to Participant until the date that is six months following the Settlement Date (or such earlier time permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the imposition of any accelerated or additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code).
Specified Employees
7. Withholding and Disposition of Shares
     (a) . Participant is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. The Company does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Award. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
Generally
     (b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Award that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign minimum statutory tax withholding obligation (i.e. federal, state, OASDI and HI and/or local) (the ""), Participant is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. Participant and the Company agree that tax withholding required as a result of cash dividend equivalents and/or periodic vesting will be handled at the Company's option by payroll deduction.
Payment of Withholding Taxes
Tax Withholding Obligation
          (i) . Unless Participant elects to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by an alternative means in accordance with Paragraph 7(b)(ii), that occurs at the Settlement Date, Participant's acceptance of this Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company to withhold on Participant's behalf the number of Shares from those Shares issuable to Participant as a result of the occurrence of a Settlement Date as the Company determines to be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
By Withholding Shares
 
          (ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arising as a result of the Settlement Date, Participant may notify the Company of Participant's election to pay Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by wire transfer, cashier's check or other means permitted by the Company. In such case, Participant shall satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation by paying to the Company on such date as it shall specify an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the expected Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a cashier's check payable to the Company, Attn: Executive Benefits, at the address set forth in Paragraph 15(a), or such other address as the Company may from time to time direct, or (iii) such other means as the Company may establish or permit. Participant agrees and acknowledges that prior to the date the Tax Withholding Obligation arises, the Company will be required to estimate the amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation and accordingly may require the amount paid to the Company under this Paragraph 7(b)(ii) to be more than the minimum amount that may actually be due and that, if Participant has not delivered payment of a sufficient amount to the Company to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation (regardless of whether as a result of the Company underestimating the required payment or Participant failing to timely make the required payment), the additional Tax Withholding Obligation amounts shall be satisfied in the manner specified in Paragraph 7(b)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Tax Withholding Obligation that arises on a date other than a Settlement Date may only be satisfied pursuant to this Paragraph 7(b)(ii).
By Other Payment
8. Excess Parachute Payments
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments in respect of this Award, together with any other payments to which Participant has the right to receive from the Company or any purchaser, successor, or assign, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G), the payments pursuant to the Award and/or such other plans or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, with any such reduction first applied to payments pursuant to any Deferred Salary Agreement to which Participant is a party and then to payments pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan.
9. Plan Controls
     The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, as it exists on the Grant Date and as the Plan is amended from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement. The term "Section" generally refers to provisions within the Plan; provided, however, the term "Paragraph" shall refer to a provision of this Agreement.
10. Limitation on Rights; No Right to Future Grants; Extraordinary Item
     By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges that: (a) Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary; (b) the value of the Award is an extraordinary item which is outside the scope of any employment contract with Participant;
 
(c) the Award is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without limitation for calculating any benefits, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and Participant will not be entitled to compensation or damages as a consequence of Participant's forfeiture as provided for in the Plan or this Agreement of any unvested portion of the Award for any reason; and (d) in the event that Participant is not a direct employee of Company, the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary and the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with Participant's employer, the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company shall be under no obligation whatsoever to advise Participant of the existence, maturity or termination of any of Participant's rights hereunder and Participant shall be responsible for familiarizing himself or herself with all matters contained herein and in the Plan which may affect any of Participant's rights or privileges hereunder.
11. Committee Authority
     Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or the Plan, any adjustments required to be made under the Plan, and any controversy that may arise under the Plan or this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding.
12. Transfer Restrictions
     Any sale, transfer, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, conveyance in trust, gift, transfer by bequest, devise or descent, or other transfer or disposition of any kind, whether voluntary or by operation of law, directly or indirectly, of (i) Unvested Units, (ii) Vested Units prior to the Settlement Date, or (iii) Shares subject to such Unvested Units or Vested Units shall be strictly prohibited and void; provided, however, Participant may assign or transfer the Award to the extent permitted under the Plan, provided that the Award shall be subject to all the terms and condition of the Plan, this Agreement and any other terms required by the Committee as a condition to such transfer.
13. Suspension or Termination of Award
     Pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if at any time prior to Participant's receipt of Shares pursuant to the Award an Authorized Officer reasonably believes that Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct (as defined below), the Authorized Officer, the Committee or the Board may suspend Participant's rights to vest in any Restricted Stock Units, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of Vested Units pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed. In addition, pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if the Committee or an Authorized Officer determines Participant has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Company or any Subsidiary, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Company ethics policy or code of conduct, deliberate disregard of Company or Subsidiary rules, or if Participant makes an unauthorized disclosure of any Company or Subsidiary trade secret or confidential information, solicits any employee or service provider to leave the employ or cease providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary, breaches any intellectual property or assignment of inventions covenant, engages
 
in any conduct constituting unfair competition, breaches any non-competition agreement, induces any Company or Subsidiary customer to breach a contract with the Company or any Subsidiary or to cease doing business with the Company or any Subsidiary, or induces any principal for whom the Company or any Subsidiary acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship (any of the foregoing acts, an ""), then except as otherwise provided by the Committee, (i) neither Participant nor Participant's estate nor transferee will be entitled to vest in or have the restrictions on Unvested Units lapse, or otherwise receive payment or Shares in respect of Vested Units and (ii) Participant will forfeit all undelivered Vested and Unvested Units. In making such determination, the Committee or an Authorized Officer shall give Participant an opportunity to appear and present evidence on his or her behalf at a hearing before the Committee or an opportunity to submit written comments, documents, information and arguments to be considered by the Committee. Any dispute by Participant or other person as to the determination of the Committee must be resolved pursuant to Paragraph 15(j).

The review by the arbitrator will be limited to determining whether Participant or Participant's transferee has proven that the Committee's decision was arbitrary or capricious. This arbitration will be the sole and exclusive review permitted of the Committee's decision. Participant explicitly waives any right to judicial review.
          (ii) Notice of demand for arbitration will be made in writing to the Committee within thirty (30) days after written notice to Participant of the applicable decision by the Committee.

The Amendment also updates the summary of rights attached as Exhibit B to the First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement.
     The above description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Rights Agent
     WHEREAS, the Company and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, the predecessor Rights Agent, entered into a First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of May 1, 2001 (as amended, the "");
Rights Agreement
     WHEREAS, Section 26 of the Rights Agreement permits the amendment of the Rights Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company;
     WHEREAS, pursuant to a resolution duly adopted on May 17, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company has duly adopted and authorized the amendment of the Rights Agreement to amend the definition of "Acquiring Person" to permit Royce & Associates, LLC to beneficially own up to 17.999% of the Common Shares (as defined in the Rights Agreement); and
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved and determined that such amendment is in the best interest of the Company and consistent with, and for the purpose of fulfilling, the objectives of the Board of Directors in connection with the original adoption of the Rights Agreement;
     NOW, THEREFORE, the Rights Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
     1. AMENDMENT OF SECTION 1(a). Section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     (a) "Acquiring Person" means any Person that, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding, , that Royce & Associates, LLC ("Royce") shall not be deemed to be an Acquiring Person until such time as Royce, together with all of its Affiliates and Associates, is the Beneficial Owner of 18% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding. The term "Acquiring Person" shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Person who acquires beneficial ownership of the Common Shares in a Permitted Transaction, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Person holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after January 22, 2003 no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 15% or more, or 18% or more in the case of Royce, of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; , , that, if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more, or
;

18% or more in the case of Royce, of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company and at a time when such Person is the Beneficial Owner of 15% or moreor 18% or more in the case of Royce, of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (as such number has most recently been disclosed by the Company in any filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other widely disseminated public disclosure) become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, upon Board Approval, the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph has become such inadvertently, and such Person divests as promptly as practicable (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion) a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then such Person shall not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, as of May 18, 2007, no Stock Acquisition Date has occurred with respect to Royce and Royce is not an Acquiring Person.
,
     2. AMENDMENT OF EXHIBIT B. Exhibit B of the Rights Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     The Board of Directors of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") issued one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company issued and outstanding on the closing date of the Company's initial public offering (the "Record Date"). Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one Common Share at a price of $80.00 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment.
     The Rights were issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 23, 1992 (the "Original Rights Agreement"), by and between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank. The Original Rights Agreement was amended on May 27, 1999 by an Amendment to Rights Agreement and was amended and restated by the First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated May 1, 2001 (the "Restated Rights Agreement"), by and between the Company and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as successor Rights Agent. The Restated Rights Agreement amended the Original Rights Agreement (as previously amended) to, among other things, extend the term of the Rights Agreement to April 30, 2011 and increase the Purchase Price to $80.00 per Common Share. The Restated Rights Agreement was amended on April 4, 2003 by an Amendment to First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the "First Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement") and
 
was amended again on May 18, 2007 by a Second Amendment to First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the "Second Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement"). The First Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement amended the definition of "Acquiring Person." The Second Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement amended the definition of "Acquiring Person" and the summary of rights attached as Exhibit B to the Restated Rights Agreement. On August 1, 2001, LaSalle Bank, National Association, replaced Computershare Investors Services, LLC, as Rights Agent.
     The Original Rights Agreement, the Restated Rights Agreement, the First Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement and the Second Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Rights Agreement."
     The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Restated Rights Agreement, the First Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement and the Second Amendment to Restated Rights Agreement.
     Until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth (10) day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more, or 18% or more in the case of Royce & Associates, LLC ("Royce"), of the outstanding Common Shares (an "Acquiring Person"), except that the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company, any such subsidiary or any person who acquires beneficial ownership of the Common Shares in a Permitted Transaction (as such term is described below) or, from and after January 22, 2003, any person that becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more, or 18% or more in the case of Royce, of the Common Shares of the Company as a result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such person to 15% or more, or 18% or more in the case of Royce, of the Common Shares of the Company, (ii) the close of business on the fifteenth (15) business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to any person becoming an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of 19.9% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (iii) the close of business on the tenth (10) day after the Board of Directors determines that any person (other than Robert A. Young, III) or group of persons (an "Adverse Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of a substantial amount of Common Shares (but not less than 10% of the outstanding Common Shares) and that (a) such Adverse Person intends to cause the Company to repurchase such Common Stock or to exert pressure against the Company to take any actions or enter into any transactions to provide such Adverse Person with short-term gains or profits under circumstances in which the Board of Directors determines that the long-
th
th
th
 
term interests of the Company and its stockholders would not be served by taking such actions or entering into such transactions or (b) beneficial ownership by such Adverse Person is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, competitive position, prospects or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries (the earlier of such dates being the "Distribution Date"), the Rights associated with Common Shares represented by certificates outstanding on the Record Date will be evidenced by such certificates with a copy of the Summary of Rights from the Original Rights Agreement attached to the certificate.
     The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares to which they are associated. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights associated with Common Shares represented by certificates issued after the Record Date (whether upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares) will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights (the "Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
     The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on April 30, 2011 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company, in each case, as described below.
     The Purchase Price payable and the number of Common Shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares at a price or securities convertible into Common Shares with a conversion price less than the then current market price of the Common Shares, or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
     In the event that (i) the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger with an Acquiring Person or Adverse Person and the Common Shares are not changed or exchanged, (ii) an Acquiring Person or Adverse Person engages in certain self-dealing transactions with the Company, (iii) any person becomes the beneficial owner of 19.9% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (unless the event in which such person acquired 19.9% or more of the outstanding Common
 
Shares is a Permitted Transaction), (iv) the Company engages in a reclassification or recapitalization that results in an increase of more than 1% of an Acquiring Person's or Adverse Person's percentage ownership of the Company or (v) the Board of Directors declares any person to be an Adverse Person, the proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or an Adverse Person (which will then be void), will have the right to receive upon exercise that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the applicable exercise price of the Right.
     For the purposes of the Rights Agreement, a Permitted Transaction is a stock acquisition or tender or exchange offer pursuant to a definitive agreement which would result in a person beneficially owning 50% or more of the Common Shares and which was approved by the Board of Directors prior to the execution of the agreement or the public announcement of the offer.
     In the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction (other than with a subsidiary of the Company), or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, unless such event is a Permitted Transaction, proper provisions will be made so that each holder of a Right will have the right to receive, upon the exercise of the Right at the then applicable exercise price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the applicable exercise price of the Right.
     With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least l% in such Purchase Price. No fractional Common Shares will be issued and in lieu of such fractional shares, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
     At any time prior to the close of business on the tenth (10) day following the public announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). In addition, the Board of Directors may extend or reduce the period during which the Rights are redeemable, so long as the Rights are redeemable at the time of such extension or reduction. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 25, 2007, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2007 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 25, 2007)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2007 net income of $19.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, compared to second quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $29.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's second quarter 2007 revenue was $458.2 million compared to second quarter 2006 revenue of $479.3 million.
ABF Freight System Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had second quarter 2007 revenue of $442.9 million, a per-day decrease of 5.1% from second quarter 2006. Second quarter 2007 operating income at ABF was $30.5 million compared to $46.4 million during the second quarter of 2006. ABF's second quarter 2007 operating ratio was 93.1% versus an operating ratio of 90.1% in the second quarter of 2006. "During this year's second quarter, ABF effectively managed through a challenging environment with a softer, more competitive marketplace," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.
     ABF's second quarter 2007 total weight per day decreased by 6.9% versus last year. "Our year-over-year tonnage comparisons have not significantly changed since the fourth quarter of last year," said Mr. Davidson. "However, it's helpful to remember that during last year's second quarter, especially in June, ABF experienced significant increases in total business. In the current environment, ABF's continual focus on maintaining pricing discipline, controlling costs and adding value to customer relationships becomes even more important."
 
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $25.53, an increase of 1.2% over last year's second quarter figure of $25.22. "The nominal yield increase was reduced by significant changes in freight mix and shipment profile," said Mr. Davidson. "As we have noted before, revenue per hundredweight is an imperfect measure of yield. Currently, we find that rates in our industry remain compensatory."
     "We continue to be excited about our long-term prospects for profitable growth with our Regional Performance Model (RPM), which provides improved next-day and second-day services in the eastern two-thirds of the United States. Because ABF is still in the early stages of marketing RPM, the investment in these new services increased ABF's second quarter operating ratio by 1.3 percentage points," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF is making progress in the regional sector. In most cases, as in our traditional long-haul market, ABF is securing this business by meeting specific customer needs or by providing value in other ways, such as superior cargo care."
     Throughout the quarter, ABF continued to excel in operational areas, including cargo care and safety and security, which translate into customer satisfaction and profitability. So far this year, ABF's cargo claim ratio, a measure of net cash payouts to revenue, is only 0.70%. Compared to previous full-year figures, this is ABF's best record in 24 years and the best in the nationwide LTL industry. Lower expenses associated with third-party casualty claims improved ABF's second quarter operating ratio by one half of a percentage point compared with the same period last year. As a percent of revenue, these second-quarter costs were the lowest in the last five years, when compared to both second-quarter and full-year figures. In May 2007, ABF was awarded the 2007 Excellence in Security Award from the American Trucking Associations (ATA) Security Council. In only the seventh year of this award's existence, ABF was recognized with this honor for an unprecedented fourth time. "These are real examples of how ABF distinguishes its services in the marketplace through its Quality Process, which has been active throughout the company since 1983," said Mr. Davidson. "Damage-free handling of freight cargo in a safe and secure environment is important to our customers. All of our employees take pride in producing the high standard that ABF maintains in these important areas of customer service."
 
Capital Expenditures Update
     Due to the current freight environment and because of delays in the timing of real estate opportunities throughout ABF's network, Arkansas Best now estimates that 2007 net capital expenditures will be approximately $95 million to $110 million. This is a reduction from the original $110 million to $135 million range that was provided at the beginning of the year.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results.

ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
Arkansas Best Corporation's largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF"), is a carrier member of Trucking Management, Inc. ("TMI"). TMI, or an affiliate, has represented its member companies, including ABF, in previous negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") for the National Master Freight Agreement and its related Supplemental Collective Bargaining Agreements ("NMFA") which covers all of ABF's drivers, dockworkers and certain other employees. The current NMFA expires on March 31, 2008 and ABF anticipates that negotiations for a new agreement with the IBT will begin before the end of the current year. A member company has the right to elect not to be represented by TMI prior to the commencement of negotiations for a new contract.
On August 15, 2007, ABF advised TMI that ABF will conduct future negotiations directly with the IBT for the purpose of entering into a new collective bargaining agreement applicable only to ABF which agreement would replace the current NMFA. As a result, TMI and its related associations will not serve as the collective bargaining representative and agent of ABF.

At each annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and election, the respective successors of each class shall be elected for three year terms.
     (b) The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. In case of any increase in the number of directors in advance of an annual meeting of stockholders, each additional director shall be elected by the
 
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, to hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen (as provided in the last sentence of this subsection (b)), or until his successor shall have been duly chosen. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from an increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the three classes of directors so as to maintain such classes as nearly equal as possible.
     SECTION 3. . Any director, member of a committee, or other officer may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing, and shall take effect at the time specified therein, and if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the president or secretary.

Any person nominated as a director by a stockholder shall furnish the Secretary of the Corporation all information required by the corporation of Board nominees.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no person shall be eligible to serve as a director unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws.

The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

     SECTION 3. . The corporate seal shall be circular in form and shall contain the name of the corporation, the year of its creation, and the words "CORPORATE SEAL DELAWARE." Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or otherwise reproduced.

     SECTION 1. .
Indemnification
     (a) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
     (b) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and
 
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     (d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.
     (e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VII. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees or agents shall be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
     (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
     (g) The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
 
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.
     (h) For purposes of this Article VII, references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
     (i) For purposes of this Article VII, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Article VII.
     (j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     These Bylaws may be altered and repealed and new bylaws adopted at any annual meeting of the stockholders, or at any special meeting of the stockholders if notice thereof is contained in the notice of such special meeting, by the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, or by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors at any regular meeting of the Board of Directors, or at any special meeting of the Board of Directors if notice thereof is contained in the notice of such special meeting.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     On October 26, 2007, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2007 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 26, 2007)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2007 net income of $18.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share, compared to third quarter 2006 net income of $31.5 million, or $1.24 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's third quarter 2007 revenue was $479.8 million compared to third quarter 2006 revenue of $507.3 million.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System,Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had third quarter 2007 revenue of $462.2 million, a per-day decrease of 6.4% from third quarter 2006. Third quarter 2007 operating income at ABF was $28.5 million compared to $49.4 million during the third quarter of 2006. ABF's third quarter 2007 operating ratio was 93.8% versus an operating ratio of 90.0% in the third quarter of 2006. "In the midst of a challenging freight environment, ABF maintained its focus on providing value to our customers while closely monitoring costs and displaying pricing discipline," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.
     "Our third quarter profitability was influenced by several factors," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF's operating margins continue to be impacted by the effects of lower tonnage levels. In addition, as in previous quarters, the costs associated with investment in ABF's RPM initiative added about a percentage point to ABF's third quarter operating ratio. Finally, higher costs associated with workers' compensation claims, offset in part by some improvement in third-party casualty claims, added almost a point. However, it is important to note that because of lower workers' compensation and third-party casualty expenses in the first half of the year, these year-to-date costs are in line with the same period last year and with historical averages."
 
     ABF's third quarter 2007 total weight per day decreased by 5.8% versus last year's third quarter. "Since October of last year, when we first experienced significant declines in business levels, through this August, ABF's tonnage trends remained fairly consistent," said Mr. Davidson. "Year-over-year tonnage comparisons for the month of September were slightly worse as we believe the economy began to weaken further compared to the first eight months of the year," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF's year-over-year tonnage trends in October are running below the same period last year by approximately 4 to 4.5%. As a result, we have taken further cost-cutting steps in order to bring our network in line with business levels."
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $25.87, essentially the same as last year's third quarter figure of $25.91. "In the midst of a tight freight environment, industry pricing is very competitive though most carriers are maintaining rational pricing," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF's overall yield continues to be affected by changes in freight mix and shipment profile. During the third quarter, ABF supplemented tonnage in its LTL business with additional spot-priced truckload shipments, improving the utilization of system capacity and increasing ABF's total average shipment size. Progress in ABF's regional freight initiative caused length of haul to decrease during the third quarter. When excluding these factors that reduce revenue per hundredweight, pure pricing on ABF's traditional LTL business increased by approximately two percent, consistent with increases on our contracts and deferred-pricing agreements."
     "In spite of the current freight environment, we continue to be optimistic about the potential for long-term success from ABF's Regional Performance Model (RPM). During the third quarter, tonnage trends for these shipments were better than those in ABF's traditional long-haul markets," said Mr. Davidson. "Beginning in the fourth quarter, the year-over-year impact on operating results of the RPM investment should be reduced as we start to compare back to prior-year periods that included those same costs. ABF remains fully committed to this initiative, and we anticipate that RPM will positively impact future revenue growth and profitability as we gain additional market share."
     ABF's current labor contract with its unionized employees will expire on March 31, 2008. ABF expects to begin labor negotiations next month and anticipates a timely agreement.
     Based on December 31, 2006 multiemployer pension plan information which recently became available, the current estimate of ABF's contingent withdrawal liabilities for all multiemployer plans is in the range of approximately $800 to $850 million, on a pre-tax basis. The range has increased primarily based upon plan assumptions used by the Central States
 
pension fund that have not been verified by ABF or its independent pension counsel. The estimate of ABF's contingent withdrawal liabilities could change if further changes in plan assumptions are made.

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results.

ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On February 11, 2008, Arkansas Best Corporation ("the Company") announced that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the "IBT") has ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, effective April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2013 (the "New Labor Agreement"), among the IBT and ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF"), the largest subsidiary of the Company.
A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K.
The New Labor Agreement covers approximately 8,700 employees, which represents approximately 76% of ABF's total active employees as of December 31, 2007, and replaces the existing National Master Freight Agreement that will expire on March 31, 2008. The New Labor Agreement continues ABF's obligation to contribute to certain multi-employer pension funds and contains provisions and conditions that are customary in collective bargaining agreements of this type, including (among other things) the scope of work to be performed, management, wages, hours and shifts, termination and benefits provisions, vacation and holidays, seniority, health and safety and dispute settlement procedures. A few of the key terms of the New Labor Agreement are set forth below:
The foregoing summary of the New Labor Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of New Labor Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The parties will make certain technical amendments to the form of the New Labor Agreement prior to its effective date. In addition, the parties have or will enter into various supplements and local agreements applicable to certain classifications of employees and certain local unions that modify or supplement the terms of the New Labor Agreement.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
The (Company or Association) hereinafter referred to as the EMPLOYER and the TEAMSTERS NATIONAL FREIGHT INDUSTRY NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE representing Local Unions affiliated with the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, and Local Union No.____ which Local Union is an affiliate of the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                    
                    
Section 1. Employers Covered
The Employer consists of Associations, members of Associations who have given authorization to the Associations to represent them in the negotiation and/or execution of this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements, and individual Employers who become signator to this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements as hereinafter set forth. The signator Associations enter into this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements as hereinafter set forth. The signator Associations represent that they are duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements on behalf of their members under and as limited by their authorizations as submitted prior to negotiations.
Section 2. Unions Covered
The Union consists of any Local Union which may become a party to this Agreement and any Supplemental Agreement as hereinafter set forth. Such Local Unions are hereinafter designated as "Local Union." In addition to such Local Unions, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee representing Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, hereinafter referred to as the "National Union Committee," is also a party to this Agreement and the agreements supplemental hereto.
Section 3. Transfer of Company Title or Interest
The Employer's obligations under this Agreement including Supplements shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns. The Employer agrees that the obligations of this Agreement shall be included in the agreement of sale, transfer or assignment of the business. In the event an entire active or inactive operation, or a portion thereof, or rights only, are sold, leased, transferred or taken over by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings, such operation or use of rights shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof. Transactions covered by provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidations, spinoffs or any other method by which a business is transferred.
It is understood by this Section that the signator Employer shall not sell, lease or transfer such run or runs or rights to a third party to evade this Agreement. In the event the Employer fails to require the purchaser, transferee, or lessee to assume the obligations of this Agreement, as set forth above, the Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union(s) and to the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require the assumption of the terms of this Agreement until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement. The obligations set forth above shall not apply in the event of the sale, lease or transfer of a portion of the rights comprising less than all of the signator Employer's rights to a nonsignator company unless the purpose is to evade this Agreement. Corporate reorganizations by a signatory Employer, occurring during the term of this Agreement, shall not relieve the signatory Employer or the reorganized Employer of the obligations of this Agreement during its term.
When a signator to this Agreement purchases rights from another signator, the provisions of Article 5 shall apply. The applicable layoff provisions of this Agreement shall apply.
The Employer shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee, or other entity involved in the sale, merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer, spinoff, lease or other transaction by which the operation covered by this Agreement or any part thereof, including rights only, may be transferred. Such
 
notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Local Union, at the time the seller, transferor or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described, whichever first occurs. The Local Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.
The term rights shall include routes and runs.
Section 1. Master Agreement
The execution of this National Master Freight Agreement on the part of the Employer shall apply to all operations of the Employer which are covered by this Agreement and shall have application to the work performed within the classifications defined and set forth in the Agreements supplemental hereto.
Section 2. Supplements to Master Agreement
     (a) There are several segments of the trucking industry covered by this Agreement and for this reason Supplemental Agreements are provided for each of the specific types of work performed by the various classifications of employees controlled by this Master Agreement.
All such Supplemental Agreements are subject to and controlled by the terms of this Master Agreement and are sometimes referred to herein as "Supplemental Agreements."
All such Supplemental Agreements are to be clearly limited to the specific classifications of work as enumerated or described in each individual Supplement.
In all cases involving the transfer of work and/or the merger of operations subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 or Article 5, Section 2, where more than one Supplemental Agreement is involved and one or more of them contains provisions contrary to those set forth in Article 8, Section 6 or Article 5, Sections 2, the applicable terms and conditions of the NMFA shall supersede those of the contrary Supplemental Agreements, including the resolution of any seniority related grievances that may arise following approval of the involved transfer of work and/or merger of operations.
     (b) The parties shall establish four (4) Regional Area Iron and Steel and/or Truckload Supplements to the National Master Freight Agreement.
The Employer and the Local Union, parties to this Agreement, may enter into an agreement whereby road drivers working under an Over-the-road Supplemental Agreement have the opportunity to perform work covered by and subject to the above Regional Area Supplements, under conditions agreed upon. Such Supplement shall be submitted to the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee.
     (c) The jurisdiction covered by the National Master Freight Agreement and its various Supplements thereto includes, without limitation, stuffing, stripping, loading and discharging of cargo or containers. This does not include loading or discharging of cargo or containers to or from vessels except in those instances where such work is presently being performed. Existing practices, rules and understandings, between the Employer and the Union, with respect to this work shall continue except to the extent modified by mutual agreement.
Section 3. Non-covered Units
This Agreement shall not be applicable to those operations of the Employer where the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a Union not signatory to this Agreement, or to those employees who have not designated a signatory Union as their collective bargaining agent.
Card Check
     (a) When a majority of the eligible employees performing work covered by an Agreement designated by the National Negotiating Committee to be Supplemental to the National Master Freight Agreement execute a card
 
authorizing a signatory Local Union to represent them as their collective bargaining agent at the terminal location, then, such employees shall automatically be covered by this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements. If an Employer refuses to recognize the Union as above set forth and the matter is submitted to the National Labor Relations Board or any mutually agreed upon process for determination, and such determination results in certification or recognition of the Union, all benefits of this Agreement and applicable Supplements shall be retroactive to the date of demand for recognition. In such cases the parties may by mutual agreement negotiate wages and conditions, subject to Regional Joint Area Committee approval.
The parties agree that a constructive bargaining relationship is essential to efficient operations and sound employee relations. The parties recognize that organizational campaigns occur in bargaining relationships and that both parties are free to accurately state their respective positions concerning the organization of certain groups of employees. However, the parties also recognize that campaigns must be waged on the facts only. Accordingly, the parties will not engage in any personal attacks against Union or Company representatives or attacks against the Union or Company as an institution during the course of any such campaign.
Additions to Operations: Over-the-road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements
     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the provisions of the National Master Freight Agreement and the applicable Over-the-road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements shall be applied without evidence of union representation of the employees involved, to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation, and newly established terminals and consolidations of terminals which are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation.
If an Employer refuses to recognize the Union as above set forth and the matter is submitted to the National Labor Relations Board or any mutually agreed upon process for determination, and such determination results in certification or recognition of the Union, all benefits of this Agreement and applicable Supplements shall be retroactive to the date of demand for recognition.
The provisions of Article 32 Subcontracting, shall apply to this paragraph. Extensions or additions to current operations, etc., which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operation shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Change of Operations Committee for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 Change of Operations, apply and, if so, to what extent.
Section 4. Single Bargaining Unit
The employees, Unions, Employers and Associations covered under this Master Agreement and the various Supplements thereto shall constitute one (1) bargaining unit and contract. It is understood that the printing of this Master Agreement and the aforesaid Supplements in separate Agreements is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate bargaining units.
This National Master Freight Agreement applies to city and road operations, and other classifications of employment authorized by the signatory Employers to be represented by Employer Associations or Employers, where applicable, participating in national collective bargaining. The common problems and interest, with respect to basic terms and conditions of employment, have resulted in the creation of the National Master Freight Agreement and the respective Supplemental Agreements. Accordingly, the Associations and Employers, parties to this Agreement, acknowledge that they constitute a single national multiemployer collective bargaining unit, composed of the Associations named hereinafter and those Employers authorizing such associations to represent them for the purpose of collective bargaining, and solely to the extent of such authorization, and such other individual employers which have, or may, become parties to this Agreement.
Section 5. Riders
Upon the effective date of this Agreement, all existing or previously adopted Riders which provide less than the wages, hours, and working conditions specifically established by this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements shall become null and void. Thereafter, the specific provisions of this Agreement and applicable Supplemental Agreements shall apply without being subject to variance by Riders. This Section shall not be applied or interpreted to eliminate operational, dispatch, or working rules not specifically set forth in this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements.
 
Section 1. Recognition
     (a) The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee and Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are the exclusive representatives of all employees in the classifications of work covered by this National Master Freight Agreement, and those Supplements thereto approved by the Joint National Negotiating Committees for the purpose of collective bargaining as provided by the National Labor Relations Act.
Subject to Article 2, Section 3 Non-covered Units, this provision shall apply to all present and subsequently acquired over-the-road and local cartage operations and terminals of the Employer.
This provision shall not apply to wholly owned and wholly independently operated subsidiaries which are not under contract with local IBT unions. "Wholly independently operated" means, among other things, that there shall be no interchange of freight, equipment or personnel, or common use, in whole or in part, of equipment, terminals, property, personnel or rights.
Union Shop
     (b) All present employees who are members of the Local Union on the effective date of this subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Local Union as a condition of employment. Union membership for purposes of this Agreement, is required only to the extent that employees must pay either (i) the Union's initiation fees and periodic dues or (ii) service fees which in the case of a regular service fee payer shall be equal to the Union's initiation fees and periodic dues, and in the case of an objecting service fee payer shall be the proportion of the initiation fees and dues corresponding to the portion of the Union's total expenditures that support representational activities. All present employees who are not members of the Local Union and all employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members of the Local Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the beginning of their employment or on and after the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the effective date of this subsection or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. An employee who has failed to acquire, or thereafter maintain, membership in the Union as herein provided, shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after his/her Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Local Union, certifying that membership has been, and is continuing to be, offered to such employee on the same basis as all other members and, further, that the employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues or initiation fee payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time as it may be made and become effective under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
For purposes of this Article, "present employees" and "employees who are hired hereafter" shall include "casual employees" as defined in Article 3, Section 2 of this Agreement. Such "casual employees" will be required to join the Union prior to their employment on or after the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following their first (1st) day of employment for any Employer signatory to this Agreement.
Hiring
     (c) When the Employer needs additional employees covered by this Agreement, it shall give the Local Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Local Union. Upon a written request from the referring Local Union, the Employer shall inform the Local Union of whether an applicant is being hired or not hired, or whether no decision has been made. Violations of this subsection shall be subject to the Grievance Committee. It is recognized that the Employer legally is not permitted to share with the Local Union information regarding the reasons for a refusal to hire an applicant.
Any employment examination for applicants must test skills or physical abilities necessary for performance of the
 
work in the job classification in which the applicant will be employed. Violations of this subsection shall be subject to the Grievance Committee.
State Law
     (d) No provision of this Article shall apply in any state to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. If under applicable state law additional requirements must be met before any such provisions may become effective, such additional requirements shall be first met.
Agency Shop
     (e) If any agency shop clause is permissible in any state where the provisions of this Article relating to the Union Shop cannot apply, the following Agency Clause shall prevail:
     (1) Membership in the Local Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain, or drop their membership in the Local Union, as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on, or discriminate against, an employee as regards such matters.
     (2) Membership in the Local Union is separate, apart and distinct from the assumption by one of his/her equal obligation to the extent that he/she receives equal benefits. The Local Union is required under this Agreement to represent all of the employees in the bargaining unit fairly and equally without regard to whether or not an employee is a member of the Local Union. The terms of this Agreement have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit and not only for members in the Local Union, and this Agreement has been executed by the Employer after it has satisfied itself that the Local Union is the choice of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. Accordingly, it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit pays his/her own way and assume his/her fair share of the obligations along with the grant of equal benefits contained in this Agreement.
     (3) In accordance with the policy set forth under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this Section, all employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay to the Local Union, the employee's exclusive collective bargaining representative, an amount of money equal to that paid by other employees in the bargaining unit who are members of the Local Union, which shall be limited to an amount of money equal to the Local Union's regular and usual initiation fees, and its regular and usual dues. For present employees, such payments shall commence thirty-one (31) days following the effective date or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, and for new employees, the payment shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment.
Savings Clause
     (f) If any provision of this Article is invalid under the law of any state wherein this Agreement is executed, such provision shall be modified to comply with the requirements of state law or shall be renegotiated for the purpose of adequate replacement. If such negotiations shall not result in mutually satisfactory agreement, either party shall be permitted all legal or economic recourse.
Employer Recommendation
     (g) In those instances where subsection (b) hereof may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all employees that they become members of the Local Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement, to refer new employees to the Local Union representative, and to recommend to delinquent members that they pay their dues since they are receiving the benefits of this Agreement.
Business agents shall be permitted to attend new employee orientations in right-to-work states. The sole purpose of the business agent's attendance is to encourage employees to join the Union.
Future Law
     (h) To the extent such amendment may become permissible under applicable federal and state law during the life of this Agreement as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial determination, all of the provisions of this Article shall be automatically amended to embody the greater Union security provisions contained in the 1947-1949 Central States Area Over-The-Road Motor Freight Agreement, or to apply or become effective in situations not now permitted by law.
 
No Violation of Law
     (i) Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed so as to require the Employer to violate any applicable law.
Section 2. Probationary and Casual Employees
     
(a) Probationary Employees
     (1) A probationary employee shall work under the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be employed on a trial basis as provided for in each Supplement.
     (2) During the probationary period, the employee may be terminated without further recourse; provided, however, that the Employer may not terminate the employee for the purpose of evading this Agreement or discriminating against Union members. A probationary employee who is terminated by the Employer during the probationary period and is then worked again at any time during the next full twelve (12) months at any of that Employer's locations within the jurisdiction of the Local Union covering the terminal where he/she first worked, except in those jurisdictions where the Local Union maintains a hiring hall or referral system, shall be added to the regular seniority list with a seniority date as of the date that person is subsequently worked. The rules contained in subsection (a) (2) are subject to provisions in the Supplements to the contrary.
     (3) Probationary employees shall be paid at the new hire rate of pay during the probationary period; however, if the employee is terminated by the Employer during such period, he/she shall be compensated at the full contract rate of pay for all hours worked retroactive to the first (1st) day worked in such period.
     CDL-qualified employees hired into driving positions who are not currently on the seniority list at an NMFA carrier and who for two (2) or more years regularly performed CDL-required driving work for a commonly-owned NMFA carrier shall be compensated at 90% of the full contract rate of pay for one (1) year and go to the full contractual rate thereafter, provided they have not had a break in service in excess of three (3) years.
     (4) The Union and the Employer may agree to extend the probationary period for no more than thirty (30) days, but the probationary employee must agree to such extension in writing.
     
(b) Casual Employees
     (1) A casual employee is an individual who is not on the regular seniority list and who is not serving a probationary period. A casual may be either a replacement casual or a supplemental casual as hereinafter provided. Casuals shall not have seniority status. Casuals shall not be discriminated against for future employment.
     (2) a. Replacement casuals may be utilized by an Employer to replace regular employees when such regular employees are off due to illness, vacation or other absence, except when an absence of a regular employee continues beyond three (3) consecutive months, a replacement casual shall not thereafter be used to fill such absence, unless the Employer and the Local Union mutually agree to the continued use of a replacement casual. If a CDL-qualified casual filling a position has been regularly employed for a period of six (6) months or more, he will not be required to go through a probationary period if hired into a full-time position.
          b. Where the Company is using casuals as vacation replacements for regular employees, and the Area Supplemental Agreement does not provide a method to add regular employees based on the use of casuals to replace vacation absence, the vacation schedules shall be broken into yearly quarters beginning January 1st, and subsequent vacation quarters shall begin on April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st thereafter.
Starting with the quarter beginning April, 1991, and continuing each quarter thereafter, the Employer shall add one (1) additional employee to the regular seniority list for each sixty-five (65) vacation replacement days worked by a casual during each vacation quarter.
The application of this formula shall not result in pyramiding.
New employees shall be placed on the respective seniority lists on the first (1st) day of the following quarter unless there are employees in layoff status, in which case such new employees shall be placed on the respective seniority list at the time the laid-off employees are recalled from layoff status.
 
Employees shall first be added to the regular seniority list from the preferential list, if applicable. Thereafter, employees to be added to the regular seniority list shall be determined by the respective Supplement and shall be subject to the probationary provisions of that Supplement.
In the application of this formula, employees specifically designated under an appropriate reporting procedure to replace absence other than vacations shall not be included as vacation replacements. It is the intent of the parties, in the application of this formula, to add regular employees to the seniority list to replace employees on vacation where there is regular work opportunity for such additional employees.
The implementation of this provision may raise issues particular to a respective Supplemental Agreement. Failure to resolve the issues, such Supplemental Negotiating Committee may agree to waive this provision, or submit the disputed issues to the National Grievance Committee.
     (3) Supplemental casuals may be used to supplement the regular work force as provided for in each respective Supplement. Once the number of new employees to be added as required in the Supplement is determined, the Employer must initiate the processing of the new probationary employees immediately, and complete such processing as provided for in the Supplements.
Unless specifically provided otherwise in the applicable Supplemental Agreement, four- (4) hours casuals may be used to supplement the regular workforce if all available regular employees at the applicable Employer facility are working or scheduled to work. Four- (4) hour casuals shall not be started after 8:00 a.m. for morning shifts and earlier than 4:00 p.m. for evening shifts and shall not be called for less than four (4) hours work. Four- (4) hour casuals are required to start on the scheduled bid start time or end by the conclusion of the shift. If worked over four (4) hours in a shift, a four- (4) hour casual shall be guaranteed eight (8) hours of work and that shift shall be counted as a supplemental day for the purpose of adding new employees. Four- (4) hour casuals shall not be worked on a "back-to-back" or overlapping basis.
No employee will work more than one (1) shift in a twenty-four- (24) hour period. (Example: 12:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.)
The Employer shall use four- (4) hour casuals to perform dock work only unless the Local Union agrees otherwise.
Four- (4) hour casuals in the Central States Region shall receive pension contributions for days worked consistent with the provisions of the Central States Pension Plan.
A laid-off employee called for work will be called for an eight- (8) hour shift.
Guidelines covering the use of four- (4) hour casuals will be in accordance with the Central Region Local Cartage Supplemental Agreement.
Work rules governing the use of four- (4) hour casuals will be by the Local Union.
     (4) Unless waived in writing by any Joint Supplemental Negotiating Committee, all Supplements shall provide for a preferential casual hiring list and shall provide the qualifications for placement on such list. Casuals on the preferential hiring list shall be offered available extra work and future regular employment in seniority order by classification as among themselves. A preferential casual employee's seniority date shall be the date he/she becomes a regular employee; and such employee shall not be subject to any probationary period.
Casual employees on the preferential hiring list shall have full access to the grievance procedure.
The provisions of Article 3, Section 3, shall apply to casual employees on the preferential hiring list who are paid on the regular payroll.
Local Unions employing an exclusive hiring hall under the terms of the Supplemental Agreement may petition the respective Joint Area Supplemental Negotiating Committee for approval to waive this subparagraph (4).
     (5) Casual road employees, where permitted by Supplemental Agreement, may only be used within the
 
jurisdiction of their respective Regional Area and shall gain preferential status and/or regular seniority status as provided in the respective Supplement, except on approved two-man operations when the extra boards are exhausted.
     (6) Any casual employee who declines regular employment shall be terminated without recourse and will not be used by the Employer for any further work.
     (7) a. Casual Employment
The Employer agrees to give first opportunity for work as a casual employee to those CDL-qualified employees on layoff at a commonly-owned NMFA carrier. This obligation shall apply only at terminals located within the jurisdiction of the employee's Local Union. The Local Union will furnish Employer with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of those laid-off employees interested in casual work opportunity and the job each employee is qualified to perform. Where applicable, casual employment may not be offered to laid-off employees under this provision ahead of preferential casuals, nor shall this provision supersede an established order of call in a supplemental agreement.
     b. Regular Employment
The Employer agrees to offer regular employment to those employees on letter of layoff from a commonly-owned NMFA carrier at other terminals located within the jurisdiction of the employee's Local Union who have made application for regular employment at the terminal offering regular employment. Employment shall be offered in accordance with the following order, unless the Supplemental Agreement or an agreed to practice provides a different order of call, in which case such other order of call shall prevail:
     1. Preferential casuals, where applicable.
     2. Employees of the Employer, on a seniority basis.
     3. Employees of a commonly-owned NMFA carrier based on the date such employees made application.
Employees who for two (2) or more years regularly performed CDL-required driving work for a commonly-owned NMFA carrier shall be compensated at 90% of the full contract rate of pay for a period of one (1) year and go to the full contractual rate thereafter. Other employees hired into regular employment shall be paid in accordance with the new hire rate set forth in Article 36, herein and shall establish seniority in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Employees who accrue seniority under this provision who are on layoff from another Employer shall retain seniority rights at the terminal they are laid off from until such time as they are recalled to that terminal. Employees who accrue seniority under this provision who are on layoff from another terminal of the same Employer shall retain their seniority at the terminal they are laid off from until such time as recalled to that terminal. At that time, the employee must either accept recall and forfeit seniority at the new terminal or refuse recall and forfeit seniority at the terminal he/she is being recalled to.
In order to be eligible for either casual or regular employment opportunity under this provision, the laid off employee must meet the minimum hiring standards established by the Employer and be otherwise qualified to perform the work available and must be able to report for work in compliance with the Employer's established call-time procedures. The Employer's hiring standards and examinations shall be applied uniformly to all applicants for employment. The Employer shall provide the hiring standards and examinations upon written request of the Local Union. Employees who are offered work opportunity under this provision must be able to furnish proof of their qualification to perform the work available.
Any employment examination for applicants must test skills or physical abilities necessary for performance of the work in the job classification in which the applicant will be employed. Violation of this subsection shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
     (8) Fringe benefits will be paid on casuals in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Agreement. Minimum daily guarantees will be governed by the respective Supplemental Agreement.
     (9) A monthly list of all casual and/or probationary employees used during that month shall be submitted to the
 
Local Unions by the tenth (10th) day of the following month. Such list shall show:
     a. the employee's name, address, and social security number;
     b. the date worked;
     c. the classification of work performed each date, and the hours worked; and,
     d. the name, if applicable, of the employee replaced.
This list shall be compiled on a daily basis and shall be available for inspection by a Union representative and/or job shop steward.
Unless otherwise agreed to in any Supplemental Agreement, the following will apply:
     (10) Supplemental casuals may be used to supplement the regular work force (dock only) and shall be subject to a four- (4) hour guarantee when called to work. Four- (4) hour casuals shall be started on an established starting time; or when called to work at a time other than an established starting time, must end his/her shift at the conclusion of that established starting time shift. Four- (4) hour casuals shall be eligible for pension and/or health welfare contributions in accordance with the applicable supplemental agreement.
For the purpose of adding regular employees in accordance with the supplemental agreement, casuals who six (6) hours or more or back-to-back on a shift shall be considered as having worked a supplemental day towards seniority. Once regular employees are required to be added in accordance with the applicable supplement, the employer must initiate the processing of the new probationary employees immediately and complete such processing as provided for in the applicable supplement.
     
(c) Employment Agency Fees
If employees are hired through an employment agency, the Employer is to pay the employment agency fee. However, if the Local Union was given equal opportunity to furnish employees under Article 3, Section (1) (c), and if the employee is retained through the probationary period, the fee need not be paid until the thirty-first (31st) day of employment.
Section 3. Check-off
The Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement the dues, initiation fees and/or uniform assessments of the Local Union having jurisdiction over such employees and agrees to remit to said Local Union all such deductions. Where laws require written authorization by the employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. The Local Union shall certify to the Employer in writing each month a list of its members working for the Employer who have furnished to the Employer the required authorization, together with an itemized statement of dues, initiation fees (full or installment), or uniform assessments owed and to be deducted for such month from the pay of such member. The Employer shall deduct such amount within two (2) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification of the member and remit to the Local Union in one (1) lump sum within three (3) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification. The Employer shall add to the list submitted by the Local Union the names and Social Security numbers of all regular new employees hired since the last list was submitted and delete the names of employees who are no longer employed. Check-off shall be on a monthly or quarterly basis at the option of the Union. The Local Union and Employer may agree to an alternative option to deduct Union dues bimonthly.
When an Employer actually makes a deduction for dues, initiation fees and assessments, in accordance with the statement of certification received from an appropriate Local Union, the Employer shall remit same no later than three (3) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification and in the event the Employer fails to do so, the Employer shall be assessed ten percent (10%) liquidated damages. All monies required to be checked off shall become the property of the entities for which it was intended at the time that such check-off is required to be made. All monies required to be checked off and paid over to other entities under this Agreement shall become the property of those entities for which it was intended at the time that such payment or check-off is required to be made.
Where an employee who is on check-off is not on the payroll during the week in which the deduction is to be made,
 
or has no earnings or insufficient earnings during that week, or is on leave of absence, the employee must make arrangements with the Local Union and/or the Employer to pay such dues in advance.
The Employer agrees to deduct from the paycheck of all employees covered by this Agreement voluntary contributions to DRIVE. DRIVE shall notify the Employer of the amounts designated by each contributing employee that are to be deducted from his/her paycheck on a weekly basis for all weeks worked. The phrase "weeks worked" excludes any week other than a week in which the employee earned a wage. The Employer shall transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one (1) check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee's social security number and the amount deducted from that employee's paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer's actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
The Employer will recognize authorization for deductions from wages, if in compliance with state law, to be transmitted to Local Union or to such other organizations as the Union may request if mutually agreed to. No such authorization shall be recognized if in violation of state or federal law. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law.
In the event that an Employer has been determined to be in violation of this Article by the decision of an appropriate grievance committee, and if such Employer subsequently is in violation thereof after receipt of seventy-two (72) hours' written notice of specific delinquencies, the Local Union may strike to enforce this Article. However, such strike shall be terminated upon the delivery thereof. Errors or inadvertent omissions relating to individual employees shall not constitute a violation.
Upon written request of an employee, the Employer shall make payroll deductions for the purchasing of U. S. Savings Bonds.
The Employer hereby agrees to participate in the Teamsters National 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Plan") on behalf of all employees represented for purposes of collective bargaining under this agreement, and shall authorize the Plan to allow for participating employee, upon his request, to take loans on his contributions to the Plan. The Employer is not required to participate in the Teamsters National 401(k) if Teamsters employees were eligible to participate in an Employer sponsored 401(k) as of January 1, 1998.
The Employer will make or cause to be made payroll deductions from participating employee's wages, in accordance with each employee's salary deferral election subject to compliance with ERISA and the relevant tax code provisions. The Employer will forward withheld sum to State Street Bank or its successor at such time, in such form and manner as required pursuant to the Plan and Declaration of Trust (the "Trust").
The Employer will execute a Participation Agreement with TNFINC and the Trustees of the Plan evidencing Employer participation in the Plan effective prior to any employee deferral being received by the Plan.
Section 4. Work Assignments
The Employers agree to respect the jurisdictional rules of the Union and shall not direct or require their employees or persons other than the employees in the bargaining units here involved, to perform work which is recognized as the work of the employees in said units. This is not to interfere with bona fide contracts with bona fide unions.
Section 5.
The term "Local Union" as used herein refers to the IBT Local Union which represents the employees of the particular Employer for the purpose of collective bargaining at the particular place or places of business to which this Agreement and the Supplements thereto are applicable, unless by agreement of the Local Union involved, or a Change of Operations Committee, or a jurisdictional award under Article 30 herein, jurisdiction over such employees, or any number of them, has been transferred to some other Local Union, in which case the term Local Union as used herein shall refer to such other Local Unions. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter the multiemployer, multi-union unit or single contract status of this Agreement.
 
Section 6. Electronic Funds Transfer
If the Employer institutes an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system, employees may participate.
Section 7. Utility Employee
The parties recognize the need for the Employers to compete effectively in a changing environment. To this end, there shall be established a new position on the local cartage seniority list called a Utility Employee. The intent of the parties' creation of the Utility Employee position is to generate additional job opportunities and enhance employee earnings by enhancing the Employer's ability to complete and grow.
Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee, the Employer may establish Utility Employee positions at any facility at its discretion as-needed, and CDL-qualified road or local cartage employees may bid for Utility Employee positions in accordance with established terminal bidding procedures. All CDL-qualified drivers with the required endorsements shall have the opportunity to transfer to the local cartage operation, if necessary, and bid for open Utility Employee positions with full seniority rights. There shall be no retreat rights for employees who transfer to the local cartage operation to bid an open Utility Employee position. For example, if a road driver bids into the Utility Employee position, he relinquishes his road seniority for bidding purposes and cannot return to the road driver classification, unless through a change of operations, or bid back rights consistent with the applicable Supplement.
The Employer shall be permitted to assign a qualified local cartage employee to a Utility Employee position on a temporary basis when necessary to pursue business opportunities that become available, as long as the temporary assignment is made in seniority order and if senior employees do not accept the temporary positions, less senior employees are forced from the bottom of the seniority list.
Temporary vacancies in the Utility Employee position, for things such as sickness, vacations, leaves of absences, will be filled consistent with practices under the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
The Utility Employee shall work across all classifications as assigned and as necessary to meet business needs, and there shall be no restrictions on the type of freight or work handled. A Utility Employee's duties during a tour of duty may, at his/her home terminal, include performing Utility-related dock work, P&D (local cartage) work, hostling/yard work (drop & hooks), and any driving work. At larger facilities where the Employer utilizes Utility Employees and there is more than Utility work performed, the Employer will designate a specific area on the dock where freight to be handled by Utility Employees will be staged. Non-utility freight will be staged at a designated area and the employees at the destination terminal will handle the non-utility freight.
A Utility employee shall perform all local cartage functions at his home terminal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Supplemental Agreement to the contrary, Utility Employees also may be required to work across Local Union jurisdictional lines. It is not the intent to use Utility Employees to perform local peddle runs or P&D work outside their Local Union's jurisdiction. At away terminals, a Utility Employee may perform Utility-related dock work, hostling and drop and hooks on his/her own equipment. A Utility Employee shall fuel his/her own equipment at away terminals if there are no fuelers available. All Utility Employees shall be returned to his home domicile at the end of his shift absent bona fide extenuating circumstances, in which case they shall be paid on all hours.
The Employer shall pay each Utility Employee an hourly premium of $1.00 per hour over the highest rate the Employer pays to local cartage drivers under the Supplemental Agreement covering the Utility Employee's home domicile. Employees in progression who bid into Utility Employee positions or individuals the Employer hires into Utility Employee positions shall complete the progression for local cartage drivers outlined in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. A Utility Employee in progression shall receive the hourly premium in addition to the Utility Employee's progression rage.
A Utility Employee's workweek shall consist of any four (4) ten (10) hour or five (5) eight (8) hour consecutive days starting Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, subject to a forty (40) hour guarantee during that period. With four (4) ten (10) hour days, the Utility Employee shall have three (3) consecutive days off. With five- (5) eight (8)-hour days, the Utility Employee shall have two (2) consecutive days off. The Employer may establish multiple start times bid by Utility Employees and may slide such start times on a daily basis by either thirty (30) minutes before or thirty
 
(30) minutes after the bid start times.
The parties recognize that most, if not all locations, will have Utility Employees regardless of facility size, geographic and /or service area. Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee or the Committee Chairman or their designees, the Employer may establish and modify Utility Employee positions and bids without the approval of a change of operations or other Union approval.
All bids shall be offered in seniority order, and, if senior employees do not bid open positions, less senior employees shall be forced from the bottom of the seniority list.
In the event the Employer's proposed use of a Utility Employee position causes a transfer, change or modification of any driver's present terminal, breaking point or domicile, the proposed change shall be submitted to a National Utility Employee Review Committee comprised of three representatives designated by the President of TMI and three representatives designated by the Chairman of TNFINC. The President of TMI or his designee and the Chairman of TNFINC or his designee shall be the TMI and the TNFINC Chairmen of the National Utility Review Committee. The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed Utility Employee operational changes are to be heard.
The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall have the authority to determine the seniority application of employees affected by the operational change and such determination shall be final and binding. No proposed operational change will be approved which violates this Agreement. In the event the National Utility Employee Review Committee is unable to resolve a matter, the case shall be submitted to the National Utility Employee Review Committee on an expedited basis. Neither the Union nor the Employer shall unreasonably delay the scheduling or completion of any requested meeting, or the submission of any dispute to the National Review Committee. In no event shall a Utility Employee operational change hearing be held more than fifteen (15) business days after the Employer meets with the affected Local Unions to discuss the written operational change proposal.
Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of Article 3, Section 7 shall be first referred to the National Utility Employee Review Committee for resolution. If the National Utility Employee Review Committee is unable to reach a decision on an interpretation or grievance, the issue will be referred to the National Grievance Committee. The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall have jurisdiction over alleged violations of seniority rights in the bidding of the Utility Employee positions, issues regarding the utilization of the Utility Employee position consistent with this Section, and issues regarding the seniority rights of employees bidding into the Utility Employee position.
Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee, the Employer may establish the number of Utility Employee positions at any location.
The parties agree that nothing in this Article 3, Section 7 shall alter the Employer's ability to engage in layoffs in accordance with the layoff provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement. In the event a Utility Employee is laid off, the Employer may re-bid that position in accordance with seniority provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
The Employer shall give one (1) job steward, during his regular working hours or if outside his regular working hours his/her designated alternate, an opportunity to participate in the Employer's orientation of new employees, or the right to meet with new employees during their workday to inform them of the benefits of Union representation without loss of time or pay.
The Employer shall have the sole right to schedule the time and place for such participation so as not to interfere with the Employer's operation.
The Employer recognizes the right of the Local Union to designate job stewards and alternates from the Employer's seniority list. The authority of job stewards and alternates so designated by the Local Union shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:
 
     (a) The investigation and presentation of grievances with his/her Employer or the designated company representative in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement;
     (b) The collection of dues when authorized by appropriate Local Union action;
     (c) The transmission of such messages and information, which shall originate with and are authorized by the Local Union or its officers, provided such message and information;
     (1) have been reduced to writing; or,
     (2) if not reduced to writing, are of a routine nature and do not involve work stoppages, slowdowns, refusal to handle goods, or any other interference with the Employer's business.
Unless waived in writing, there shall be a steward or available bargaining unit member of the employee's choice present whenever the Employer meets with the employee about grievances or discipline or to conduct investigatory interviews. If a steward is unavailable, the employee may designate a bargaining unit member who is available at the terminal at the time of the meeting to represent him/her. Meetings or interviews shall not begin until the steward or designated bargaining unit member is present. An employee who does not want a Union steward or available bargaining unit member present at any meeting or interview where the employee has a right to Union representation must waive Union representation in writing. If the Union requests a copy of the waiver, the Employer shall promptly furnish it.
Job stewards and alternates have no authority to take strike action, or any other action interrupting the Employer's business, except as authorized by official action of the Local Union. The Employer recognizes these limitations upon the authority of job stewards and their alternates, and shall not hold the Local Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Employer in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper discipline, including discharge, in the event the job steward or his/her designated alternate has taken unauthorized strike action, slowdown or work stoppage in violation of this Agreement.
The job steward, or his/her designated alternate, shall be permitted reasonable time to investigate, present and process grievances on the company property without loss of time or pay during his/her regular working hours without interruption of the Employer's operation by calling group meetings; and where mutually agreed to by the Local Union and the Employer, off the property or other than during his/her regular schedule without loss of time or pay. Such time spent in handling grievances during the job steward's or his/her designated alternate's regular working hours shall be considered working hours in computing daily and/or weekly overtime if within the regular schedule of the "job steward."
The job steward, or his/her designated alternate, shall be permitted reasonable time off without pay to attend Union meetings called by the Local Union. The Employer shall be given twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice by the Local Union.
Section 1. Seniority Rights
     (a) The application of seniority which has been accrued herein shall be established in the Supplemental Agreements.
     (b) Seniority shall be broken only by discharge, voluntary quit, retirement, or more than a five (5) year layoff.
     (c) This Section shall apply to all Supplemental Agreements.
Section 2. Mergers of Companies General
     (a) In the event the Employer is a party to a merger of lines, seniority of the employees who are affected thereby shall be determined by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Local Unions involved.
In the application of this Section, it is immaterial whether the transaction is called a merger, purchase, acquisition, sale, etc.
 
Further, it is also immaterial whether the transaction involves merely the purchase of stock of one (1) corporation by another, with two (2) separate corporations continuing in existence.
     (b) If such merger of companies results in the combination of terminals or over-the-road operations, a change of operations shall be submitted to the Co-Chairmen of the National Grievance Committee for assignment to an appropriate Change of Operations Committee established pursuant to Article 8, Section 6. The Change of Operations Committee shall retain jurisdiction for one (1) year after the effective date of the Committee decision and shall have the authority to amend its decision in the event of a substantial change in the amount of work to be performed at the terminals or over-the-road operations which were combined.
Combining of Terminals or Operations as a Result of Merger of Companies
     (c) In the application of this Section, when terminals or operations of two (2) or more companies are combined, as referred to above, the following general rules shall be applied by the Employer and the Local Unions, which general rules are subject to modification pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of this Article:
Active Seniority List
     (1) The active employee seniority rosters (excluding those employees on letter of layoff) shall be "dovetailed" by appropriate classification (i.e., road or city) in the order of each employee's full continuous classification (road or city) seniority date that the employee is currently exercising. (The term "continuous classification seniority" as used herein is defined as that seniority which the employee is currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided in Section 1 of this Article or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee.) The active "dovetailed" seniority roster shall be utilized first and until exhausted to provide employment at such combined terminal or operational location.
Layoff Seniority List
     (2) In addition, the inactive seniority rosters (employees who are on letter of layoff) shall be similarly "dovetailed" by appropriate classification. If additional employees are required after the active list is exhausted, they shall be recalled from such inactive seniority roster and after recall such employees shall be "dovetailed" into the active seniority roster with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority dates they are currently exercising which shall then be exercised for all purposes. Seniority rosters previously combining job classifications shall be continued unless otherwise agreed.
Temporary Authority
     (d) Where only temporary authority is granted in connection with any of the transactions described above, then separate seniority lists shall continue only when terminals or operations are not merged, unless otherwise agreed. The Employer which is to survive will assume the obligations of both collective bargaining agreements during the period of the temporary authority.
In the event of temporary merger of operations which are contingent upon approval by regulatory agencies or on other stated conditions, the seniority of the involved employees shall continue to accrue with their original Employer during the period of temporary merger, so that if there is no final consummation of the merger, the seniority of such employees shall be continued with their respective employers. However, if, on the failure of final consummation and dissolution of the merger, one of the parties to the proposed merger discontinues the operations which were subject to such merger, the employees of such Employer shall be granted seniority rights for all purposes with the other Employer only for the period of time they were employed in such temporary merged operations.
Purchase of Rights
     (e) If a merger, purchase, acquisition, sale, etc., constitutes merely the acquisition of permits or rights, without the purchase or acquisition of equipment or terminals, and/or without the consolidation of terminals or operations, or in the event of the purchase of rights during bankruptcy proceedings, the following shall apply:
Where the purchasing company has a terminal operation at the domicile of the employees of the seller, the employees of the selling company shall be placed on a master seniority list, and the purchasing company or companies shall hire,
 
after recall of the purchasing company's employees from layoff, such employees as needed for regular employment within the first twelve (12) calendar months after purchase or acquisition of permits and/or rights, and they shall be dovetailed with full seniority. If an employee refuses a bona fide offer of regular work opportunity with any of the purchasing companies, his/her name shall be removed from the list. No employee hired under this provision shall be required to serve a probationary period. After the expiration of the aforementioned twelve (12) calendar month period, the purchaser shall have no further obligation to the employees of the seller.
However, if the purchasing or acquiring company does not have and/or continue a terminal or operation at the domicile of the employees of the seller, resulting in their layoff, such Employer shall place the laid-off employees on a master seniority list and such Employer shall, if and when additional regular employees are required, within a twelve- (12) calendar month period after purchase or acquisition, and providing its employees on layoff have been recalled, offer employment to such laid-off employees at the terminal locations or operations to which the work has been transferred. Any such laid-off employees accepting transfer shall be dovetailed in accordance with their terminal seniority for work purposes, including layoff, and holding company seniority for all fringes. If an employee refuses a bona fide offer of regular work opportunity with any of the purchasing companies, his/her name shall be removed from the list. No employee hired under this provision shall be required to serve a probationary period. After the expiration date of the aforementioned twelve- (12) calendar month period, the purchaser shall have no further obligation to the employees of the seller. The transferring employee shall be responsible for lodging and moving expenses.
Exclusive Cartage Operations
     (f) If in connection with the transactions described in these rules the successor Employer determines to discontinue the use of a local cartage company, the employees of that local cartage company who have worked exclusively on the pickup and delivery service which is retained by the successor Employer shall be given the opportunity to continue to perform such service as an employee of such successor Employer, and shall have their seniority "dovetailed" as described in the above rules.
Committee Authority
     (g) Area and/or State Committees created pursuant to Local Supplements which have previously established rules of seniority, not contrary to the provisions of such Supplements, and approved by the Joint Area Committee, may continue to apply such rules if such rules are reduced to writing.
Section 3. Intent of Parties
     (a) The parties acknowledge that the above rules are intended solely as general standards and further that many factual situations will be presented which necessitate different application, modification or amendment. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that questions of the application of seniority rights may arise which require different treatment and it is anticipated and understood that the Employers and Unions jointly involved and/or the respective grievance committees may mutually agree to such disposition of questions of seniority which in their judgment is appropriate under the circumstances.
     (b) In all instances, the disposition of questions involving the application of seniority rights made by the parties pursuant to this Section may be presented to the appropriate grievance committees provided herein whose decisions shall be final and binding.
Section 4. Equipment Purchases
     (a) The Employer shall not require as a condition of continued employment, that an employee purchase truck, tractor and/or tractor and trailer or other vehicular equipment, or that any employees purchase or assume any proprietary interest or other obligation in the business, except as referred to in Article 6, Section 2. The requirements of this provision shall be maintained during the renegotiation of this Agreement unless either party has terminated the Agreement in the manner provided.
Highest Rates Prevail
     (b) If the minimum wage, hours and working conditions in the Company absorbed differ from those minimums
 
set forth in this Agreement and Supplements thereto, the higher of the two shall remain in effect for the employees so absorbed.
Cutting Seniority Board
     (c) The Union reserves the right to cut the road seniority board when the average weekly earnings fall to eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) or less. This is not to be construed as imposing a limitation on earnings. After the Union notifies the Employer to cut the board and in the event that Employer refuses, the Union shall immediately submit the matter to the grievance procedure. In determining whether average weekly earnings will fall to eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) or less, only the earnings of the lower twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers on the seniority board, counting from the bottom up, shall be considered. The average shall be calculated for the thirty (30) day period preceding the Union's original request. After such calculation is made, the average earnings of the drivers for the top seventy-five percent (75%) of the seniority board must also average more than eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) per week, or layoff shall be made in accordance with seniority. The above provisions shall also apply to extra board for sleeper drivers exclusively.
Posting Seniority List
     (d) The Employer shall give the Local Union a seniority list at least every six (6) months. The Employer shall also post a seniority list at least once every six (6) months and shall maintain a current seniority roster at the terminal. Protest of any employee's seniority date or position on such list must be made in writing to the Employer within thirty (30) days after such seniority date or position first appears, and if no protests are timely made, the dates and positions posted shall be deemed correct. Any such protest which is timely made may be submitted to the grievance procedure.
Section 5. Work Opportunity
Over-the-road and CDL-qualified local cartage employees who have been on letter of layoff for more than thirty (30) days shall be given an opportunity to relocate to permanent employment (prior to the employment of new hires) occurring at other domiciles of the Employer, provided they notify the Employer and Local Union in writing of their interest in a relocation opportunity.
The offer of relocation will be made in the order of applicable seniority of the laid-off employees domiciled within the Regional area. The Employer shall be required to make additional offers of relocation to an employee who has previously rejected a relocation opportunity provided the employee again notifies the Employer in writing of his/her continued interest in additional relocation opportunities. However, the Employer will only be required to make one relocation offer in any six (6) calendar month period. Any employee accepting such offer shall be paid at the employee's applicable rate of pay and shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority board for bidding and layoff purposes, but shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only. A relocating employee shall pay his/her own moving expenses and shall, upon reporting to such new domicile, be deemed to have relinquished his/her right to return with seniority to the domicile from which he/she relocated. The provisions of this Section shall not supersede an established order of call/hiring in the Supplemental Agreement.
Section 6.
On a weekly basis, the Employer shall be permitted to work the active seniority board 25% of the straight time hours in overtime. In the event the Employer exceeds the 25% overtime allowance, the number of overtime hours in excess of the allowance will be applied in the next following week for determining the number of employees to recall from layoff.
For example, if the Employer has 120 employees on the seniority board with 100 actively working and 20 laid off, the Employer shall be permitted 4,000 hours straight time hours plus 1,000 hours overtime (25% of 4,000) for a total of 5,000 hours to be worked that week by the active seniority board. If during that week the Employer actually worked the 100 active employees a total of 5,600 hours, there would be 600 hours in excess of the 25% overtime allowance. The 600 hours would be divided by 50 (40 straight-time hours plus 25% of 40 or 10), which equals 12 employees to be recalled from lay-off in the week following the violation of the 25% overtime allowance.
 
Section 1. Maintenance of Standards
The Employer agrees, subject to the following provisions, that all conditions of employment in his/her individual operation relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials and general working conditions shall be maintained at not less than the highest standards in effect at the time of the signing of this Agreement, and the conditions of employment shall be improved whenever specific provisions for improvement are made elsewhere in this Agreement.
Local Standards
     (a) The Local Unions and the Employer shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days following ratification of this Agreement, identify and reduce to writing, and submit to the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee, those local standards and conditions practiced under this Article. Such standards and conditions when submitted in accordance with this Section shall be currently dated. Those local standards and conditions previously practiced hereunder which are not so submitted shall be deemed to have expired.
The appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee shall, not later than ninety (90) days following ratification, adopt a procedure to consider the disposition of the local standards and conditions submitted including the right to appoint a subcommittee to make recommendations. The Regional Joint Area Committee shall provide to the parties the opportunity to present their views. The Regional Joint Area Committee shall have the sole discretion to determine the disposition of the submitted local standards and conditions which determination shall be final and binding.
Individual Employer Standards
     (b) Individual Employers may during the life of this Agreement file with the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee and request review of those individual standards and conditions claimed or practiced under this Article which exceed the provisions of this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements.
The Regional Joint Area Committee shall develop a procedure to review the filing including the right to appoint a subcommittee to make recommendations. The Committee shall make every effort to adjust the matter. If the Committee reaches agreement concerning the disposition of the individual standards or conditions, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding. In the event of deadlock, the submitted standards and/or conditions shall continue as practiced.
General
     (c) It is agreed that the provisions of this Article shall not apply to inadvertent or bona fide errors made by the Employer or the Union in applying the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such bona fide errors may be corrected at any time.
In the event a Local Union and/or employee notifies the manager at the applicable Employer facility in writing by certified mail that employees' wages are being overpaid and the Employer does not correct the overpayment within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of such notice, the Employer shall not be permitted to recoup such overpayment. The Employer shall, however, be permitted to correct the wage error by paying employees the appropriate contractual wage prospectively from the date of notice by the Local Union and/or employee, provided the correction is made prior to the expiration of this Agreement.
No other Employer shall be bound by the voluntary acts of another Employer when he/she may exceed the terms of this Agreement.
Any disagreement between the Local Union and the Employer with respect to this matter shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
This provision does not give the Employer the right to impose or continue wages, hours and working conditions less than those contained in this Agreement.

Thereafter, the parties shall enter into immediate negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution. In the event the parties cannot agree on a solution within sixty (60) days, or mutually agreed extensions thereof, after receipt of the stated written notice, either party shall be allowed economic recourse.
Section 4. New Equipment
Where new types of equipment and/or operations for which rates of pay are not established by this Agreement are put into use after April 1, 2003, within operations covered by this Agreement, rates governing such operations shall be subject to negotiations between the parties. In the event agreement cannot be reached within sixty (60) days after date such equipment is put into use, the matter may be submitted to the National Grievance Committee for final disposition. Rates agreed upon or awarded shall be effective as of the date equipment is put into use.
The above provisions shall also apply in the event the law (state or federal) is changed to permit longer combination vehicles or aggregate weight increases of 8,000 pounds or more in the weight limits that are currently provided in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982.
Employees expected to use computers will be trained to use them and will be paid for all training time. Employees expected to use computers will be given sufficient time to learn to use them.

Section 1.
All grievances or questions of interpretations arising under this National Master Freight Agreement or Supplemental
 
Agreements thereto shall be processed as set forth below.
     (a) All factual grievances or questions of interpretation arising under the provisions of the Supplemental Agreement (or factual grievances arising under the National Master Freight Agreement), shall be processed in accordance with the grievance procedure of the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
If upon the completion of the grievance procedure of the Supplemental Agreement the matter is deadlocked, the case shall be immediately forwarded to both the Employer and Union secretaries of the National Grievance Committee, together with all pertinent files, evidence, records and committee transcripts. Any request for interpretation of the National Master Freight Agreement shall be submitted directly to the Regional Joint Area Committee for the making of a record on the matter, after which it shall be immediately referred to the National Grievance Committee.

     (b) Any matter which has been referred pursuant to Section 1 (a) above, or any question concerning the interpretation of the provisions contained in the National Master Freight Agreement, shall be submitted to a permanent National Grievance Committee which shall be composed of an equal number of employer and union representatives. The National Grievance Committee shall meet on a regular basis, for the disposition of grievances referred to it, or may meet at more frequent intervals, upon call of the chairman of either the Employer or Union representatives on the National Grievance Committee. The National Grievance Committee shall adopt rules of procedure which may include the reference of disputed matters to subcommittees for investigation and report, with the final decision or approval, however, to be made by the National Grievance Committee. If the National Grievance Committee resolves the dispute by a majority vote of those present and voting, such decisions shall be final and binding upon all parties.

The Employer may request the co-chairmen of the National Grievance Committee to appoint and convene a joint Employer and Union Committee which shall have the authority to approve uniform dispatch procedures and rules which shall apply to the individual company's over-the-road operations.
No Employer signatory to this Agreement shall be permitted to have its own grievance procedure.
Section 2.
     (a) The National Grievance Committee by majority vote may consider and review all questions of interpretation which may arise under the provisions contained in the National Master Freight Agreement which are submitted by either the Chairman of TNFINC or the Executive Director of TMI. The National Grievance Committee by majority vote shall have the authority to reverse and set aside all resolutions of grievances by any lower level grievance committee or review committee involving or affecting the interpretation(s) of Articles 1-39 of the National Master Freight Agreement, in which case the decision of the National Grievance Committee shall be final and binding. A failure by the National Grievance Committee to reach a majority decision on a question concerning interpretation or on a review of a decision by a lower level grievance committee or review committee shall not be considered a deadlock and will not be referred to the National Review Committee. In case of a failure to reach a majority decision in reviewing the decision of a lower level grievance committee or review committee, the decision of the lower level grievance committee or review committee shall stand as final and binding.
     (b) All grievances deadlocked at the National Grievance Committee shall be processed as set forth below.
     1. All such deadlocked grievances shall be automatically referred to the National Review Committee, which shall consist of the Chairman of TNFINC, or his/her designee and the Executive Director of TMI, or his/her designee. The National Review Committee shall have the authority to resolve any such deadlocked case by review of the record presented to the National Grievance Committee or by rehearing the case, or by referring the case to a subcommittee of either the Joint National Negotiating Committee or the appropriate Supplemental Negotiating Committee to negotiate a recommended resolution of the case. The subcommittee of the Negotiating Committee to which the case was referred must report its recommendation or deadlock to the National Review Committee for
 
resolution. Unless the National Review Committee in writing mutually agrees otherwise, said Committee shall have a period of 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date of the National Grievance Committee deadlock to resolve the case. The decision of the National Review Committee shall be final and binding.
     2. In the event the National Review Committee is unable to resolve the deadlock, the President of the Employer involved and the Chairman of TNFINC shall have 30 additional days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays), from the final day of consideration by the National Review Committee to attempt to resolve the case. The TMI and TNFINC representatives on the National Review Committee shall be responsible for notifying the President of the Employer involved and the Chairman of TNFINC of the final day of consideration by the Committee of the deadlocked grievance. In considering factual disputes that are deadlocked or deadlocked questions of interpretation arising out of Supplemental Agreements, the decision of either the National Grievance Committee or the National Review Committee shall be based on the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
     3. No lawyers will be permitted to present cases at any step of the grievance procedure.
     4. The decision of any grievance committee or panel shall be specifically limited to the matters submitted to it and the grievance committee or panel shall have no authority in any manner to amend, alter or change any provision of the Agreement.
     5. If the Employer or Union challenges in court a decision issued by any dispute resolution panel provided for under this Agreement, the cost of the challenge, including the court costs and attorney's fees, shall be paid by the losing party.
Section 3. Work Stoppages
     (a) The parties agree that all grievances and questions of interpretation arising from the provisions of this Agreement shall be submitted to the grievance procedure for determination. Accordingly, except as authorized by law, as provided below or as specifically provided in other Articles of the National Master Freight Agreement, no work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or lockout shall be deemed to be permitted or authorized by this Agreement.
A "representation dispute" in circumstances under which the Employer is not required to recognize the Union under this Agreement is not subject to the grievance procedure herein and the provisions of this Article do not apply to such dispute.
     (b) In the event an Employer is delinquent in its health & welfare or pension payments in the manner required by the applicable Supplemental Agreement, the Local Union shall have the right to take whatever action it deems necessary until such delinquent payments are made. The Local Union shall give the Employer a seventy-two- (72) hour, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), prior written notice of the Local Union's authorization of strike action which notice shall specify the failure to make health & welfare or pension payments providing the basis for such strike authorization. In no event shall the Union have the right to strike over a dispute concerning the eligibility and/or payment of health & welfare or pension contributions by an Employer on behalf of specific individuals, and such disputes shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
     (c) In the event the Employer fails to comply with a decision rendered by a grievance committee or a grievance settlement, provided a settlement has been reduced to writing, dated and signed by both, the Local Union and the Employer shall give the Employer a seventy-two- (72) hour (excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays) prior written notice of the Local Union's authorization of strike action, which notice shall specify the basis for the compliance failure. If the Employer believes that it is in compliance or that there is a clarification needed in order to comply, the matter of compliance and/or clarification shall be submitted to the grievance committee that decided the case. The question of compliance or clarification shall be determined by the grievance committee within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of the Employer request. The forty-eight- (48) hour period for the grievance committee to determine the question of compliance or clarification shall run concurrently with the seventy-two- (72) hour notice prior to a strike. The grievance committee may meet telephonically to consider and decide questions of compliance or clarification.
Section 4.
     (a) It is mutually agreed that the Local Union will, within two (2) weeks of the date of the signing of this
 
Agreement, serve upon the Employer a written notice listing the Union's authorized representatives who will deal with the Employer, make commitments for the Local Union generally and, in particular, those individuals having the sole authority to act for the Local Union in calling or instituting strikes or any stoppages of work which are not in violation of this Agreement. The Local Union may from time to time amend its listing of authorized representatives by certified mail. The Local Union shall not authorize any work stoppages, slowdown, walkout, or cessation of work in violation of this Agreement. It is further agreed that in all cases of an unauthorized strike, slowdown, walkout, or any unauthorized cessation of work which is in violation of this Agreement the Union shall not be liable for damages resulting from such unauthorized acts of its members.
In the event of a work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or cessation of work, not permitted by the provisions of Article 8, Section 3(a), (b), or (c) alleged to be in violation of this Agreement, the Employer shall immediately send a wire or fax to the Freight Coordinator in the appropriate Regional Area and to the Chairman of TNFINC to determine if such strike, etc., is authorized.
No strike, slowdown, walkout or cessation of work alleged to be in violation of this Agreement shall be deemed to be authorized unless notification thereof by telegram has been received by the Employer and the Local Union from such Regional Area. If no response is received by the Employer within twenty-four (24) hours after request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, such strike, etc., shall be deemed to be unauthorized for the purpose of this Agreement.
In the event of such unauthorized work stoppage or picket line, etc., in violation of this Agreement, the Local Union shall immediately make every effort to persuade the employees to commence the full performance of their duties and shall immediately inform the employees that the work stoppage and/or picket line is unauthorized and in violation of this Agreement. The question of whether employees who refuse to work during such unauthorized work stoppages, in violation of this Agreement, or who fail to cross unauthorized picket lines at their Employer's premises, shall be considered as participating in an unauthorized work stoppage in violation of this Agreement may be submitted to the grievance procedure, but not the amount of suspension herein referred to.
It is specifically understood and agreed that the Employer during the first twenty-four- (24) hour period of such unauthorized work stoppage in violation of this Agreement, shall have the sole and complete right of reasonable discipline, including suspension from employment, up to and including thirty (30) days, but short of discharge, and such employees shall not be entitled to or have any recourse to the grievance procedure. In addition, it is agreed between the parties that if any employee repeats any such unauthorized strike, etc., in violation of this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement, the Employer shall have the right to further discipline or discharge such employee without recourse for such repetition.
After the first twenty-four- (24) hour period of an unauthorized stoppage in violation of this Agreement, and if such stoppage continues, the Employer shall have the sole and complete right to immediately further discipline or discharge any employee participating in any unauthorized strike, slowdown, walkout, or any other cessation of work in violation of this Agreement, and such employees shall not be entitled to or have any recourse to the grievance procedure. The suspension or discharge herein referred to shall be uniformly applied to all employees participating in such unauthorized activity. The Employer shall have the sole right to schedule the employee's period of suspension.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Councils and Local Unions shall make immediate efforts to terminate any strike or stoppage of work as aforesaid which is not authorized by such organizations, without assuming liability therefore. For and in consideration of the agreement of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Councils and Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to make the aforesaid efforts to require Local Unions and their members to comply with the law or the provisions of this Agreement, including the Provisions limiting strikes or work stoppages, as aforesaid, the Associations and Employers who are parties hereto agree that they will not hold the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Councils and Local Unions liable or sue them in any court or before any administrative tribunal for undertaking such efforts to terminate unauthorized strikes or stoppages of work as aforesaid or for undertaking such efforts to require Local Unions and their members to comply with the law or the provisions of this Agreement, or for taking no further steps to require them to do so. It is further agreed that signator Associations and Employers will not hold the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Teamsters
 
National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Councils or Local Unions liable or sue them in any court or before any administrative tribunal for such unauthorized work stoppages alleging condonation, ratification or assumption of liability for undertaking such efforts to terminate strikes or stoppages of work, or requiring Local Unions and their members to comply with the law or the provisions of this Agreement.
The provisions of this Article shall continue to apply during that period of time between the expiration of this Agreement and the conclusion of the negotiations or the effective date of the successor Agreement, whichever occurs later, except as provided in Article 39. It is understood and agreed that failure by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, and/or Joint Councils to authorize a strike by a Local Union shall not relieve such Local Union of liability for a strike authorized by it and which is in violation of this Agreement.
     (b) The question of whether the International Union, Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Council or Local Union have met its obligation set forth in the immediately preceding paragraphs, or the question of whether the International Union, Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, and Joint Council or the Local Union, separately or jointly, participated in an unauthorized work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or cessation of work in violation of this Agreement by calling, encouraging, assisting or aiding such work stoppage, etc., in violation of this Agreement, or the question of whether an authorized strike provided by Article 8, Section 3(a), (b) or (c) is in violation of this Agreement, or whether an Employer engaged in a lockout in violation of this Agreement, shall be submitted to the grievance procedure at the national level, prior to the institution of any damage suit action. When requested, the cochairmen of the National Grievance Committee shall immediately appoint a subcommittee to develop a record by collecting evidence and hearing testimony, if any, on the questions of whether the International Union, Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, Joint Council or Local Union have met its obligations as aforesaid, or of Union Participation or Employer lockout in violation of this Agreement. The record shall be immediately forwarded to the National Grievance Committee for decision. If a decision is not rendered within thirty (30) days after the cochairmen have convened the National Grievance Committee, the matter shall be considered deadlocked.
A majority decision of the National Grievance Committee on the questions presented as aforesaid shall be final and binding on all parties. If such majority decision is rendered in favor of one (1) or more of the Union entities, or the Employer, in the case of lockout, no damage suit proceedings on the issues set forth in this Article shall be instituted against such Union entity or such Employer. If, however, the National Grievance Committee is deadlocked on the issues referred to in this subsection 4(b), the issues must be referred to the National Review Committee for resolution prior to either party instituting damage suit proceedings. If the National Review Committee decides that a strike was unlawful, it shall not have the authority to assess damages. Except as provided in this subsection 4(b), agreement to utilize this procedure shall not thereafter in any way limit or constitute a waiver of the right of the Employer or Union to commence damage suit action. However, the use of evidence in this procedure shall not waive the right of the Employer or Union to use such evidence in any litigation relating to the strike or lockout, etc., in violation of this Agreement. There shall not be any strike, slowdown, walkout, cessation of work or lockout as a result of a deadlock of the National Grievance Committee on the questions referred to under this subsection 4(b) and any such activity shall be considered a violation of this Agreement.
     (c) In the event that an Employer, party to this Agreement, commences legal proceedings against the Union after the Union's compliance with the provisions of Article 8, Section 3(a), (b) or (c), the Employer Associations will cooperate in the presentation to the court of the applicable majority grievance committee decision.
     (d) Nothing herein shall prevent the Employer or Union from securing remedies granted by law except as specifically set forth in subsection 4(b).
Section 5.
     (a) In the event of strikes, work stoppages, or other activities authorized by Article 8, Section 3(a), (b) or (c) of this Agreement, no interpretation of this Agreement or any Supplement thereto relating to the Employer's obligation to make health & welfare and/or pension contributions by any tribunal shall be binding upon the Union or affect the legality or lawfulness of the strikes unless the Union stipulates to be bound by such interpretation, it being intention of the parties to resolve all questions of interpretation by mutual agreement.
     (b) It is the intention of the parties to resolve all grievances and requests for interpretation arising under this
 
Agreement through the grievance procedure. However, it is understood and agreed that nothing herein shall prevent the Employer or Union from securing remedies in those circumstances where the application of this Agreement is contrary to law.
Section 6. Change of Operations
Change of Operations Committee
     (a) Present terminals, breaking points or domiciles shall not be relocated, changed or modified without the approval of an appropriate Change of Operations Committee. Such Committee shall be appointed in each of the Regional Areas, equally composed of Employer and Union representatives. The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the seniority of the employees affected and such determination shall be final and binding.
In the event a proposed change of operations includes the establishment of either a new or satellite terminal as a "combination" facility with a common city driver and dock seniority roster, when such change of operations results in the relocation or movement of city drivers and dock employees from an existing terminal recognizing separate (split) seniority rosters for city drivers and dock employees, the Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the conditions under which such a combination facility may be established, including but not limited to, the number of city drivers and dock employees who qualify, be allowed to follow the work to the new or satellite combination terminal, the implementation of training programs to qualify dock employees as city drivers and the seniority right of affected employees to either return to the "mother" terminal and/or claim additional driving positions at the satellite terminal within reasonable time periods following the establishment of such combination terminal, as determined by the Committee. Existing terminals that recognize separate city driver and dock seniority rosters (split terminals) shall not be converted to "combination" terminals unless and until such time as a majority of those affected employees agree to such conversion, in which case the Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the conditions under which such conversion shall be implemented.
Such Committee, however, shall observe the Employer's right to designate domiciles and the operational requirements of the business. Where the Union raises the question as to whether or not certain proposed runs of excessive length can be made, the Employer must be prepared to submit objective evidence including DOT certification or logs and tapes that such runs have been tested and were made within the DOT hours of service regulations. Individual employees shall not be redomiciled more than once during the term of this Agreement as the result of an approved change of operations unless a merger, purchase, sale, acquisition or consolidation of employers is involved, or unless there is proven economic need as determined by the Change of Operations Committee based on factual evidence presented.
Pension and health & welfare contributions paid on behalf of a redomiciled employee shall be paid to the Funds to which the contributions were made prior to the employee's change of domicile, and the decisions of the Change of Operations Committee shall so specify. This Section does not apply to employees who voluntarily relocation to new domiciles, unless such relocation is a result of a Change of Operations Committee decision. Any dispute concerning the appropriate fund for an Employer's contribution on behalf of a redomiciled employee, pursuant to a Change of Operations Committee decision, shall be referred to the National Grievance Committee. The decision of the National Grievance Committee shall to the extent permitted by law, be final and binding on all affected parties, including the Trust Funds.
The Change of Operations Committee shall also have jurisdiction for a period of twelve (12) months following the opening of a new terminal to consider the redomicile of employees who are laid off as a direct result of such opening of a terminal. The Committee shall also have jurisdiction over the closing of a terminal in regard to seniority, as well as to determine the conditions under which freight may or may not be interlined into the area of a vacated operations when necessary to retain major customers, including mandating the use of union carriers where available. In no event will the Employer be granted the authority to vacate a facility and interline the freight on a nonunion subsidiary of the parent company.
The above shall not apply within a twenty-five (25)mile radius.
The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to require a definition of primary and shared lanes, where applicable.
 
The Change of Operations Committee shall not grant the Employer authority to relocate U.S. operations, work, or terminals to Mexico.
Change of Operations Committee Procedure
     (b) The National Grievance Committee shall adopt Rules of Procedure concerning the application and administration of this Article.
The Employer shall notify all affected Local Unions of the proposed change of operations at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the hearing at the Regional Joint Area Committee, and the Employer and the Local Unions involved shall have a mutual responsibility to inform the employees subject to redomicile prior to such hearing in accordance with the practice and procedures agreed to in the respective Area Committee. Any exception or waiver of the aforesaid thirty (30) day period shall be mutually agreed to between the Employer and the Local Unions involved and approved by the Regional Area Change of Operations Committee.
Moving Expenses
     (c) The Employer shall pay reasonable expenses to demount and remount an employee's mobile home, if used as his/her residence and in such instance shall pay normal expenses to move such mobile home, including the use of other modes of transportation where required by law. However, it is mutually understood that the cost of such move shall not exceed nine thousand dollars ($9,000.00) per move. Commencing April 1, 2004 and every April 1st thereafter under this agreement, this amount will be increased by the prior year's average annual increase in the CPIW, U.S. city average, Housing, Household Operations expenditure category titled "Moving, storage, freight expense." A decrease in the percent change in the Index will not result in a decrease of the mobile home moving allowance once established. In the event the index is no longer published by BLS, the parties will agree to meet and find a substitute Index as an escalator.
Where an employee is required to relocation to another domicile in order to follow employment as a result of a change of operations, the Employer shall move the employee and assume the responsibility for proven loss or damage to household goods due to such move, including insurance against loss or damage. Should any employee possess household items of unusual or extraordinary value which will be included in the move, such items shall be declared and an appraised value determined prior to the move. The Employer shall provide packing materials for the employee's household goods when requested or at the employee's request pay all costs and expenses of moving such household goods, including packing.
An employee shall have a maximum of one (1) year to move in accordance with the provisions of an approved change of operations unless, prior to the expiration of such year, he/she requests, in writing, an extension for a reasonable period of time due to an unusual or special problem. The Employer shall provide lodging for the employee at the point of redomicile, not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days, and in addition, shall reimburse the employee forty cents (40) per mile to transport one (1) personal automobile to the new location. The Employer shall not be responsible for moving expenses if the employee changes his/her residence as a result of voluntary relocation.
None of the Employer obligations set forth in this Subsection (c) Moving Expenses shall apply to relocations of domiciles within a fifty (50) mile radius.
The mileage rate to transport one (1) personal automobile to the new location will increase by five (5) cents a mile.
Change of Operations Seniority
     (d) The Change of Operations Committee established herein shall have the sole authority to determine questions of the application of seniority in those situations presented to it and in connection therewith the following general rules shall apply, subject, however, to modification as provided by Section 6(g) below:
Closing, Partial Closing of Terminals Relocation of Work
          (1)a. When branches, terminals, divisions or operations (hereinafter "terminal(s)") are closed or partially closed and the work of such terminal(s) is relocated, in whole or in part, to another terminal(s), the active employees
 
(excluding those employees on letter of layoff) at the closed or partially closed terminal(s) shall have the right to bid into a master seniority roster (road or city) comprised of bidders from the active seniority rosters of closed or partially closed terminal(s) in the order of their continuous classification (road or city) seniority. Continuous classification seniority shall be defined as that seniority which the employee is currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided by Article 5, Section 1, or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee. Employees shall bid from the combined master seniority roster into openings at the terminal(s) into which work is being relocated. Employees so relocating shall be "dovetailed" into the appropriate active seniority roster at the new terminal(s) in the order of their continuous classification seniority. Such relocations shall be permitted prior to the recall of laid-off employees at such gaining terminal(s). If and when additional employees are required in excess of those who formed the combined active roster at the point of redomicile, employees on letter of layoff at that location shall be recalled. If recalled, such employees shall be "dovetailed" with their continuous classification seniority.
In addition, the inactive seniority rosters (employees who are on letter of layoff) at the terminal(s) from which employees are being redomiciled shall be "dovetailed" into a master "laid off" seniority roster and such employees shall have the same opportunities to relocation to terminal(s) within the area of the Supplemental Agreement which are afforded to employees covered by the provisions of subparagraph 2(b) below. These inactive employees at the losing terminal(s) shall also be offered first work opportunity, in seniority order, at terminals into which work was relocated within the regional area where such employees were employed. Such inactive employees shall gain active seniority in accordance with the provisions of the applicable supplemental agreement. The use of such employees shall be subject to the order of call of the supplement. The employee's seniority date for bidding and layoff purposes shall be the date which they gain active status. The employee shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only as of that date.
The senior driver voluntarily laid off at a losing domicile will be restored to the active board each time foreign drivers or casuals (where applicable) make ten (10) trips (tours of duty) within any thirty- (30) calendar day period on a primary run of such domicile, not affected by a Change of Operations.
          b. The following seniority bidding procedures are to be applied in all change of operations cases that involve master pool bidding:
     1. The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to establish a date for purposes of determining active and inactive (on letter of layoff or the equivalent thereof) employees at both gaining and losing locations.
     2. Affected employees at losing locations shall be allowed to bid onto an active master pool seniority list on a dovetailed seniority basis.
     3. At the time of the original bid, an employee on the active master pool seniority list shall be afforded the opportunity to bid any available position for which he/she is qualified at a gaining location in accordance with his/her seniority on the master pool seniority list. In the event the active employees at any given location elect not to bid the number of positions being lost at that particular location, inactive employees at that location, in accordance with their seniority, shall then be afforded the opportunity to bid as an active employee until the number of positions being lost at that particular location are filled. An employee who elects to "hold" as set forth in paragraph 4 below shall not be considered as filling a losing position. A successful bidder shall be dovetailed on the seniority list at the location he/she bids into. The number of successful bidders from any losing location shall not exceed, at the time of the original bid, the number of positions lost at that location as approved by the Change of Operations Committee.
     4. An employee on the active master pool seniority list who does not have seniority to bid the location he/she desires in the initial bid may hold for such desired location and remain at his/her present domicile in such status as his/her bidding seniority will allow. Should an opening occur during the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision at the location to which he/she desired to relocation, he/she shall be afforded relocation opportunity in line with his/her bidding seniority. A successful bidder under this provision shall be dovetailed on the applicable seniority list at the location into which he/she bids and his/her moving expenses shall be paid in accordance with other relocating employees. The relocation provisions of this Section shall apply only during the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision.
     5. An employee who elects to hold as set forth in Paragraph 4 above may hold for only one (1) location and must designate that location at the time of the original bid and may hold only for a position within the classification
 
the employee has seniority to bid. If an employee refuses to accept an opportunity to claim a position he/she is holding for, the employee shall have no further claim to a position that may become available during the window period.
     6. An employee who elects to hold, shall also be entitled to exercise seniority to claim a voluntary move under the provisions of Article 5, Section 5 herein, and in the event the employee accepts such a voluntary move, he/she shall retain his/her hold position at his/her home domicile during the remainder of the window period but shall forfeit any other seniority rights at his/her home domicile. Should a position become available at the location such employee is holding for and which the employee has seniority to successfully claim, moving expenses set forth in Article 8, Section 6(c) shall be computed from the employee's original home domicile.
     7. There shall be a maximum one hundred twenty (120) calendar day window period from the date of implementation in all Changes of Operations only when the number of positions offered at gaining terminals do not equal the number of positions lost at the losing terminals.
          (a) Any openings which may occur at a gaining terminal during the window period shall be offered to those employees on the Master Pool Seniority list who have not been offered relocation opportunity under the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 before they are offered to employees who may have elected to "hold" as set forth in paragraph 4 above.
          (b) The window period established by the Change of Operations decision shall close if either of the following conditions is met: (a) the number of days and/or months of the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision has expired; or (b) all employees on the Master Pool Seniority list have been offered work opportunities pursuant to Article 8, Section 6.
          (c) However, with respect to those who bid to "hold", it is understood that such bids must remain open and any job opportunities that are clearly identifiable as a direct result of the Change of Operations must be offered, by seniority, to those qualified employees who bid to hold for that specific location for the length of the window period(s) (road/cartage) set forth in the Change of Operations decision even if the window period is closed as set forth in paragraph (b) above.
          (d) The Company shall determine whether an additional job opportunity is the direct result of the Change of Operations at the specific gaining domicile for which the employee is "holding". The Company shall so notify the employee's current Local Union and the gaining Local Union. The Company shall have the burden of proof in establishing whether or not an additional job opportunity is clearly the direct result of the Change of Operations at the specific gaining domicile for which the employee is "holding". Any grievance filed regarding the Company's decision to permit or deny a "hold" relocation shall be filed with the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee to be heard by the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee that held jurisdiction.
     8. Employees who are qualified bidders on Long-Term Disability (LTD) at the time of bid shall be allowed to bid. If successful LTD bidders are unable to claim their bid on the date of implementation, a hold-down bid will be allowed. This hold-down bid will be offered to those remaining active employees at the LTD's current location, by classification, who have not been offered relocation opportunity under the Change of Operations. The successful hold-down bidder shall be dovetailed. When the LTD employee returns to work and claims his/her bid, the hold-down employee may either remain at the hold-down location with a bidding seniority date consistent with the date of relocation under the Change of Operations or return to his/her original location with his/her original bidding seniority date. The hold-down employee may not return to a location where the classification from which he/she bid has been eliminated. The Company shall not be responsible for the moving expense of the employee filling the hold-down bid, unless and until such time as it is determined that the employee on LTD will never be able to claim his bid and the hold-down bidder becomes a regular permanent employee at the hold-down location.
Closing of Terminals Elimination of Work
     (2)a. When a terminal(s) is closed and the work of such terminal(s) is eliminated, an employee who was formerly employed at another terminal shall have the right to return to such former terminal and exercise his/her continuous classification (road or city) seniority, provided he/she has not been away from such former terminal for more than a five- (5)year period.
 
Layoff
     b. When a terminal(s) is closed and the work of such terminal(s) is eliminated, employees who are laid-off thereby shall be given first (1st) opportunity for available regular employment in the classification in which they are employed at the time of such layoff (prior to the employment of new hires but subject to the order of call/hiring of the Supplemental Agreement) occurring at any other terminal(s) of the Employer within the area of the Supplemental Agreement where such employee was employed provided they notify the Employer in writing of their interest in a relocation opportunity. The offer of relocation will be made in the order of continuous classification seniority of the laid off employees within the area of the Supplemental Agreement. The Employer shall be required to make additional offers of relocation to an employee who has previously rejected a relocation opportunity provided the employee again notifies the Employer in writing of his/her continued interest in additional relocation opportunities. However, the Employer will only be required to make one relocation offer in any six (6) calendar month period. The obligation to offer such employment shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of closing. Any employee accepting such offer shall be employed at his/her applicable rate of pay and shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority board for bidding and layoff purposes, but shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only. A relocating employee shall pay his/her own moving expenses.
Opening of Terminals
     (3) When a new terminal(s) is opened (except as a replacement for existing operations or a new division in a locality where there are existing operations), the Employer shall offer to those employees, if any, affected thereby the opportunity to relocation to regular positions in the new terminal(s) in the order of such employee's continuous classification (road or city) seniority date as defined herein. Upon arrival at such new location, such employees shall be "dovetailed" with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority date together with other employees so relocating.
This provision is not intended to cover situations where there is replacement of an existing operation or where a new division is opened in a locality where there is an existing terminal. In these latter situations, those employees laid off at the existing facilities shall have first (1st) opportunity for employment at the new operation in accordance with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority date, and upon arrival shall be similarly "dovetailed." If all regular fulltime positions are not filled in this manner, then the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply.
     (4) When a Company which has an established Local Cartage Operation, which has been cleared by system OTR drivers, seeks to establish a new OTR domicile there, the Company shall first file for a Change of Operations giving relocation opportunity, with regard to the initial complement, to OTR drivers from those system OTR domiciles that previously serviced such Local Cartage Operation with reasonable regularity. Such relocation opportunity shall remain in effect for any additions to the initial complement for a period of not less than 120 calendar days, after which further additions to such complement shall be hired at the locality where such new OTR domicile was established.
     (5) Any employee redomiciled by an approved change of operations to another domicile shall upon reporting to such new domicile be deemed to have relinquished his/her right to return, with seniority, to the domicile from which he/she was relocated, except under another approved change of operations. Employees who avail themselves of the relocation privileges because they are on layoff at their original terminal may exercise their seniority rights if work becomes available at their original terminal during the five (5) year layoff period allowed them at their original terminal.
     (6) When an Employer's proposed Change of Operations offers a specific number of road positions at a gaining domicile, the Employer shall be required to make every good faith effort and use all practical means to hire qualified applicants to fill such offered positions that are left vacant because other employees affected by the Change have elected not to bid into that gaining domicile. The Employer's duty to hire under this provision is to use every reasonable means to advertise for qualified applicants and to meet with the affected Local Union(s) to seek qualified applicants. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to create an obligation that the Employer maintain or otherwise guarantee a specific number of employees at a gaining domicile. Any grievance concerning any issue which may arise under this provision shall be filed directly with the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee.
In the event it is determined by the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee that the Employer has not made every good faith effort and used all practical means to hire qualified applicants for road positions as required under this provision, the Committee may require the Employer to hire qualified applicant(s) as outlined above.
 
Definition of Terms
     (e) The term "continuous classification seniority" as used in this Agreement is defined as that seniority which the employee is currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided in Article 5, Section 1, or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee.
Qualifications and Training
     (f) Employees, who are presently non-CDL qualified and elect to bid to relocation to a gaining terminal that requires CDL qualified employees, shall be provided a sixty (60) day training period in order to become CDL qualified. The training period shall commence from the date the employee becomes a successful bidder and the Company shall furnish training personnel and equipment at the location where the employee is currently domiciled or otherwise as mutually agreed to. If the employee fails to qualify during such sixty (60) day period, the employee shall forfeit his/her right to fill the bid and shall remain on the seniority list of the current domicile.
Intent of Parties
     (g) The parties acknowledge that the above rules are intended solely as general standards and further that many factual situations will be presented which necessitate different application, modification or amendment. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that questions of the application of seniority rights may arise which require different treatment and it is anticipated and understood that the Employers and Unions jointly involved and/or the respective grievance committees may mutually agree to such disposition of questions of seniority which in their judgment is appropriate under the circumstances.
The Change of Operations Committees, as provided herein or in the Supplemental Agreements, shall have the authority to determine the application of seniority in those situations presented to them. In all cases, the seniority decisions of the Joint Committees, including the Change of Operations Committees and subcommittees established by the National Master Freight Agreement and the respective Supplemental Agreements, shall be final and binding.
Section 7.
Any grievance committee or panel, as constituted under this Agreement, shall have the jurisdiction and power to decide grievances which arose under the preceding agreements and supplements thereto. In doing so, the committees or panels shall follow the grievance procedure set forth in the 2003-2008 Agreement, but apply the contract under which the grievance arose.
Section 8. Sleeper Cab Operations
Unless specifically addressed in this section the provisions of the applicable supplemental agreement relating to sleeper cab operations remain in full force and effect.
     
A. Work Rules
The Local Union and the Company shall meet and negotiate dispatch and/or work rules. If no agreement is reached disputes shall be subject to the grievance machinery.
     
B. Team Classifications
     1. "Bid Team Drivers" and "Bid Team Extra Board Drivers"
Team Drivers who are classified as bid destination drivers or bid team extra board drivers will be guaranteed a minimum of thirteen hundred (1300) miles round trip when dispatched. If the dispatch of a bid sleeper team is broken between A & B (1st dispatch the drivers will be paid no less than their original dispatch). If the broken dispatch results in more miles the drivers shall be paid their actual miles driven and work performed. There will be no free time at any point reached.
     2. "Extra Board Team Drivers"
Teams who are classified as extra board drivers will receive a minimum of thirteen hundred (1300) miles round trip when dispatched.
 
     3. Turning In The Yard Home Terminal (Non-Scheduled Teams)
When mutually agreed between the sleeper team and the Employer, sleeper teams may be allowed to turn in the yard at their home domicile provided the dispatch wheel is exhausted and/or there are no other teams rested and available for dispatch. When the Employer turns a sleeper team at their home domicile any delay in excess of one (1) hour shall be compensable.
The above referenced mileage guarantees are in addition to any other earnings after dispatch.
     
C. Dispatch Method
Sleeper cab operations shall be between the designated home terminal and a designated area and/or a destination terminal unless otherwise agreed. The A, B, C, dispatch principle shall apply.
All regular sleeper runs shall be posted for bid once each six (6) months unless otherwise agreed. The number of regular runs or teams in designated areas shall be determined by taking fifty percent (50%) of the average number of runs operated by sleeper teams between two (2) or more designated points for a period of six (6) months. Disputes over bids will be referred to the Sleeper Resolution Committee.
The sleeper trip must equal a minimum of thirteen hundred (1300) paid miles.
All sleeper teams must be sent to their home terminal on the third dispatch unless otherwise mutually agreed.
     
D. Laypoint and Layover
The layover provision of this section shall apply at only one away from home terminal, and all time spent at all other points touched on a round trip from the home terminal exclusive of meal time shall be paid for at the full hourly rate for each driver.
The layover point shall be the destination of the AB dispatch and shall be designated on the driver's original orders prior to the dispatch from the point of origin and shall remain the same whether or not the drivers reached that point. If the team does not reach the original dispatch point there shall be no free time.
Upon arrival at a team's designated lay point, the Employer shall advise as soon as possible, but not later than thirty (30) minutes after the team signs in, whether the team will be turned or put to bed.
In the event the team is put to bed, they shall be compensated at the straight-time hourly rate of pay from the time they signed in until the time they were so notified.
However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., road closures; equipment breakdown; government declared emergency), the Employer may cancel a previously assigned dispatch prior to the expiration of the one hour free time and put the team to bed. In this circumstance, the team will be compensated at the straight time hourly rate of pay from the time they signed in until the time they were so notified. Failure by the Employer to make a load shall not be considered an unforeseen circumstance.
If the drivers are advised they are turning, the Company will have one-half (1/2) free hour at the laypoint and one (1) free hour at the home domicile in which to turn the drivers provided there are safe and sanitary shower facilities equipped with hot and cold water for showering. If the drivers are not dispatched within the above mentioned one-half (1/2) or one (1) hour free time, they shall be paid for all time spent in excess of the applicable rate.
If the team is relieved of duty on arrival and signs for eight (8) hours off and then is recalled within four (4) hours, they shall be paid for all time spent.
Where sleeper teams are required to layover away from their home terminal, layover paid shall commence following the tenth (10th) hour after the end of the run. If the driver is held over the tenth (10th) hour the driver shall be guaranteed two (2) hours pay in any event for the layover time. If the driver is held over more than two (2) hours the driver shall receive layover pay for each hour up to eight (8) hours in the first eighteen (18) hours of layover period, commencing after the run ends. The same principle shall apply to each succeeding eighteen (18) hours, and layover pay shall commence after the tenth (10th) hour.
 
     
E. Abuse of Free Time
Whenever any employer arbitrarily abuses the free time allowed in this section, then this shall be considered a dispute and the same shall be subject to the grievance machinery.
     
F. Mark-Off Procedure For Nonscheduled Sleeper Cab Drivers
In the event the Company and the Local Union are unable to agree to a mark-off procedure, the following shall apply unless the supplement provides otherwise.
     1. For the purposes of time off, one thousand (1000) tractor miles equals one (1) sleeper trip. (For each driver.)
     2. After the completion of four (4) consecutive trips, the drivers will be entitled to forty-eight (48) hours off, plus an additional eight (8) hours rest. The drivers may waive the forty-eight (48) hours off.
     3. After the completion of six (6) consecutive trips the drivers will be entitled to seventy-two (72) hours off, plus an additional eight (8) hours rest. Drivers entitled to such time off privileges may at their option, exercise time off privilege at the completion of either the sixth (6th), eighth (8th), or tenth (10th) trips. An extra board team that exercises their maximum time off after the eighth (8th) or tenth (10th) trip is subject to no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the active board off at one time.
     4. Where drivers fail to exercise time off privilege after the tenth (10th) trip, they shall forfeit such time off and the cycle will revert back to subsection 2.
     5. Time off privileges may be exercised only at the completion of the fourth (4th), sixth (6th), eighth (8th) or tenth (10th) trips upon the drivers returning home. An extra board team that exercises their maximum time off after the eighth (8th) or tenth (10th) trip is subject to no than fifteen percent (15%) of the active board off at one time. A driver shall not be denied the time off in accordance with the fifteen percent (15%) rule more than once prior to receiving such time off.
     6. The only exception to the above is that the Employer shall provide in the dispatch rules and/or procedures for thirty-six (36) consecutive hours off duty at the home terminal at least once a week unless otherwise agreed to, provided the driver has been on the board and required to be available.
     7. Where only one driver of an established team marks off for any reason, other than "9" below, he shall remain off until his partner returns to the home terminal, except as mutually agreed.
     8. In those instances where an extra board driver makes a combination of single operation and sleeper operation trips each driver will earn one tour for each one thousand (1,000) tractor miles while on a sleeper trip.
     9. Bid team drivers must take their earned time off at the same time as outlined above.
     10. Sleeper drivers are entitled to ten (10) hours off duty at their home domicile upon the completion of each round trip exclusive of the two (2) hour call.
     
H. Bedding and Linen
Bedding and fresh linen, excluding pillows, for sleeper cabs shall be furnished and maintained by the Employer in a clean and sanitary condition. Upon expiration of current linen provider contracts, the drivers will be compensated seven ($7.00) each per trip to furnish and maintain their linens. A trip is defined as beginning and ending at home domicile.
     
I. Sleeper Cab Equipment
All sleeper cab equipment must be provided with air conditioning and heating appliances in accordance with Article 16, Section 6 of this Agreement. In the event of mechanical failure of such air conditioning and heating appliances, repairs shall be made at the first point of repair en route where qualified, certified service and parts are available. Drivers shall be paid for all time waiting for repairs to be made to heating appliances. In the event an air conditioning
 
appliance becomes inoperable, the time necessary to complete the repairs cannot cause an unreasonable delay in the movement of freight and therefore will be limited to four (4) hours, for which drivers will be paid. In the event parts and/or qualified, certified service are not available, necessary repairs shall be completed prior to the equipment being dispatched from the next scheduled point of dispatch.
     
J. Sleeper Cab Occupants
Only two (2) drivers shall be permitted in the sleeper cab equipment at any one time except in the case of emergency, an act of God, or where new type equipment is put into operation. In no event shall a master driver be in the cab in addition to the two (2) regular drivers for more than 300 miles or ten (10) hours.
     
K. Method of Dispatch At Foreign Domiciles
Foreign domiciled sleeper teams shall be placed on a common rotating wheel at the time they arrive at a foreign domicile and shall be dispatched off that wheel on a first-in/first-out basis; provided however, a team may be dispatched out of rotation when receiving a direct dispatch back to their home domicile. Such direct dispatch may include a drop and pick en route. When more than one team from a common home domicile is on the foreign wheel, the first team in shall be the team dispatched out of rotation.
Sleeper teams who are put to bed at a foreign domicile shall be dispatched in accordance with the procedure herein; provided however, it shall not be a violation or the basis of a runaround claim, when a foreign team, whose home domicile is common to that of another team who is in bed at the foreign domicile, has been pre-dispatched on a via through the foreign domicile en route to their home domicile. A foreign team may not however, be dispatched from a home domicile to a foreign domicile and then back to their home domicile (ABA) when another team from the same home domicile is in bed at the foreign domicile.
     
L. Foreign Power Courtesy Dispatch
It shall not be a violation or the basis for a runaround when a sleeper team is dispatched on a via through a foreign domicile where other sleeper teams or single drivers are domiciled when continuing in motion over their designated sleeper lane, or being dispatched to their home domicile.
     
M. National Sleeper Cab Grievance Committee
The parties shall establish a National Sleeper Committee composed of four (4) union representatives appointed by the Chairman of TNFINC and four (4) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. The National Sleeper Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed sleeper operations are to be heard, procedures for resolving sleeper issues and procedures for establishing pre-hearing guidelines. Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of this section shall be referred to the National Sleeper Committee for resolution. If the National Sleeper Committee is unable to reach a decision on an interpretation or grievance, the issue will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
Section 1. Picket lines: Sympathetic Action
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement, and it shall not be cause for discharge, disciplinary action or permanent replacement in the event an employee refuses to enter upon any property involved in a primary labor dispute, or refuses to go through or work behind any primary picket line, including the primary picket line of Unions party to this Agreement, and including primary picket lines at the Employer's places of business.
Section 2. Struck Goods
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for discharge, disciplinary action or permanent replacement if any employee refuses to perform any service which his/her Employer undertakes to perform as an ally of an Employer or person whose employees are on strike and which service, but for such strikes, would be performed by the
 
employees of the Employer or person on strike.
Section 3.
Subject to Article 32 Subcontracting, hereof, the Employer agrees that it will not cease or refrain from handling, using, transporting, or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other Employer or cease doing business with any other person, or fail in any obligation imposed by the Motor Carriers Act or other applicable law, as a result of individual employees exercising their rights under this Agreement or under law, but the Employer shall, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, when necessary, continue doing such business, including pickup or delivery to or from the Employer's terminal and to or from the premises of a shipper or consignee.
Section 4.
The layover provision of the applicable Supplemental Agreement shall apply when the Employer knowingly dispatches a road driver to a terminal at which a primary picket line has been posted as a result of the exhaustion of the grievance procedure, or after proper notification of a picket line permitted by the collective bargaining agreement, or economic strikes occurring after the expiration of collective bargaining agreements, or to achieve a collective bargaining agreement. In such event and upon his/her request, a driver shall be provided first class public transportation to his/her home terminal, plus be paid a minimum of eight (8) hours or actual time spent while returning, whichever is greater. The Employer shall determine the mode of transportation to be utilized.
Section 1.
In the event loss, damage or theft of freight, equipment, materials, or supplies is incurred as a direct result of a proven gross negligent act by an employee in the performance of assigned work, when such act knowingly may result in such loss, damage or theft, the employee may be held responsible for such acts and may be required to assume liability for any such loss, damage or theft, in whole or in part. The term "willful, gross negligent acts" is intended to describe independent actions of any employee who knowingly violates established rules or policies that, when adhered to, clearly prevent loss, damage or theft described herein. Employees shall not be held responsible or required to assume liability for loss or damage or theft unless clear proof of willful, gross negligence is shown. In no event will an employee be held responsible for, or required to assume any liability for any loss, damage or theft when performing assigned work in a manner as specifically instructed by a supervisor. This Article shall not be utilized in any manner to hold an employee liable for any loss or damage of equipment under any conditions or for any damage to cargo as a result of a vehicular accident.
Section 2.
Prior to an employee being charged with the responsibility and liability for any loss, damage or theft because of willful gross negligent acts on the part of the employee, a hearing shall be held with the Local Union, the employee and the Employer. Employees who are found to be liable and required to make restitution for such liability, shall not then be subject to any further disciplinary action. Any disputes between the parties may be referred to the grievance procedure of the applicable Area Supplemental Agreement and the National Master Freight Agreement.
Section 1.
Should the Employer require any employee to give bond, cash bond shall not be compulsory, and any premium involved shall be paid by the Employer. The primary obligation to procure the bonds shall be on the Employer. If the Employer cannot arrange for a bond within ninety (90) days, it must so notify the employee in writing. Failure to so notify shall relieve the employee of the bonding requirement.
 
If proper notice is given, the employee shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of such notice to make his/her own bonding requirements, standard premiums only on said bond to be paid by the Employer. A standard premium shall be that premium paid by the Employer for bonds applicable to all other of its employees in similar classifications. Any excess premium is to be paid by the employee. Cancellation of a bond after once issued shall not be cause for discharge unless the bond is cancelled for cause which occurs during working hours, or due to the employee having given a fraudulent statement in obtaining said bond.
Every driver must maintain a valid commercial driver's license and be covered by insurance. If an Employer cannot cover a driver under an existing fleet policy, the Employer will promptly apply to the state assigned risk pool to provide any comparable coverage. During the pendency of the application and until insurance is obtained, the driver will not be terminated, but will be taken out of driving service. When any comparable insurance is obtained, the employee will be responsible for paying any excess over the standard charges.
Section 2. Corporate Owned Life Insurance
The Employer will not own and/or be the beneficiary of any life insurance policy on the life or lives of any members of the bargaining unit without obtaining the explicit authorization of the Teamsters National Master Freight Negotiating Committee and the individual affected employees.
Before the Employer purchases uniforms, it must present a sample of the material for the uniforms to the Union for approval. If the sample material type is not used in the finished uniforms, the Union employees are under no obligation to wear the uniform. The Union's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Employer agrees that if any employee is required to wear any kind of uniform as a condition of his/her continued employment, such uniform shall be furnished and maintained by the Employer, free of charge, at the standard required by the Employer. Said uniforms shall be made in the United States by union vendors, if possible, and will have the Teamster emblem appropriately applied.
The Employer shall replace all clothing, glasses, hearing aids and/or dentures not covered by company insurance or worker's compensation which are destroyed or damaged in a wreck or fire with company equipment.
The Employer has the right to establish and maintain reasonable standards for wearing apparel and personal grooming.
The following provisions shall govern the wearing of shorts, unless the Employer and Local Union has a prior existing practice:
During the period May 1, through September 30, employees shall be allowed to wear appropriate shorts, subject to the guidelines set forth herein. Appropriate shorts shall be defined as walking or Bermuda style shorts with at least two (2) pockets and belt loops and which cannot be shorter than two (2) inches above the knee, properly hemmed at the bottom and of a conservative basic solid color, (black, blue, brown or green). Socks and appropriate foot wear must be worn at all times.
Short shorts, cut offs, unhemmed, athletic, gym, biking, spandex and calf length shorts shall not be allowed.
No driver shall allow anyone, other than employees of the Employer who are on duty, to ride on his truck except by written authorization of the Employer, or except in cases of emergency arising out of disabled commercial equipment or an Act of God. No more than two (2) people shall ride in the cab of a tractor unless required by government agencies or the necessity of checking of equipment. This shall not prohibit drivers from picking up other drivers, helpers or others in wrecked or broken down motor equipment and transporting them to the first (1st) available point of communication, repair, lodging or available medical attention. Nor shall this prohibit the transportation of other drivers from the driver's own company at a delivery point or terminal to a restaurant for meals.
 
Section 1. Compensation Claims
     (a) The Employer agrees to cooperate toward the prompt disposition of employee on-the-job injury claims. The Employer shall provide worker's compensation protection for all employees even though not required by state law, or the equivalent thereof, if the injury arose out of or in the course of employment. No employee will be disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of filing an on-the-job injury report. The Employer or its designee shall not visit an injured worker at his/her home or at a hospital or any location outside the employee's home terminal without his/her consent.
     (b) At the time an injury report is turned in, the Employer shall provide the injured employee with an information sheet briefly outlining the procedure for submitting a worker's compensation claim to include the name, address and phone number of the company's worker's compensation representative and other pertinent information relative to claim payment.
     (c) An employee who is injured on the job, and is sent home, or to a hospital, or who must obtain medical attention, shall receive pay at the applicable hourly rate for the balance of his/her regular shift on that day. An employee who has returned to his/her regular duties after sustaining a compensable injury who is required by the worker's compensation doctor to receive additional medical treatment during his/her regularly scheduled working hours shall receive his/her regular hourly rate of pay for such time. Where not prohibited by state law, employees who sustain occupational injury or illness shall be allowed to select a physician of their own choice and shall notify the Employer in writing of such physician.
     (d) Road drivers sustaining an injury while being transported in company-provided transportation for Company purposes at a layover terminal shall be considered as having been injured on the job.
     (e) In the event that an employee sustains an occupational illness or injury while on a run away from his/her home terminal, the Employer shall provide transportation by bus, train, plane, or automobile to his/her home terminal if and when directed by a doctor.
     (f) The Employer agrees to provide any employee injured locally transportation at the time of injury, from the job to the medical facility and return to the job, or to his/her home if required.
     (g) In the event of a fatality arising in the course of employment, while away from the home terminal, the Employer shall return the deceased to his/her home at the point of domicile.
     (h) The Employer may publish reasonable safety rules and procedures and provide the Local Union with a copy. Failure to observe such reasonable rules and/or procedures shall subject the employee to disciplinary action in accordance with the disciplinary procedures in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. However, the time limitation relative to prior offenses shall be waived to permit consideration of the employee's entire record of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time personal injuries. This provision does not apply to vehicular accidents.
When issuing progressive discipline under the terms and conditions of Article 14 Section 1(h), it is understood that the time limitation relative to prior offenses of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time injuries is waived and may be included in the disciplinary process.
However it is also understood that when an employer issues progressive discipline, the employer shall not utilize prior discipline that is in excess of three (3) years old when issuing additional progressive discipline, unless the employee has shown a pattern of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time injuries.
 
Section 2. Modified Work
     (a) The Employer may establish a modified work program designed to provide temporary opportunity to those employees who are unable to perform their normal work assignments due to a disabling on-the-job injury. Recognizing that a transitional return-to-work program offering both physical and mental therapeutic benefits will accelerate the rehabilitative process of an injured employee, modified work programs are intended to enhance worker's compensation benefits and are not to be utilized as a method to take advantage of an employee who has sustained an industrial injury, nor are they intended to be a permanent replacement for regular employment.
An active employee, who is injured on the job, qualifies for workers' compensation benefits and is subsequently laid off, will continue to receive compensation payments and benefits for the period provided by his/her supplement.
     (b) Implementation of a modified work program shall be at the Employer's option and shall be in strict compliance with applicable federal and state worker's compensation statutes. Acceptance of modified work shall be on a voluntary basis at the option of the injured employee. However, refusal to accept modified work by an employee, otherwise entitled to worker's compensation benefits, may result in a loss or reduction of such benefits as specifically provided by the provisions of applicable federal or state worker's compensation statutes. Employees who accept modified work shall continue to be eligible to receive "temporary partial" worker's compensation benefits as well as all other entitlements as provided by applicable federal or state worker's compensation statutes. Employees who need additional medical and/or physical therapy may go for such treatments during scheduled hours for modified work whenever practical and reasonable.
     (c) At facilities where the Employer has a modified work program in place, temporary modified assignments shall be offered in seniority order to those regular full time employees who are temporarily disabled due to a compensable worker's compensation injury and who have received a detailed medical release from the attending physician clearly setting forth the limitations under which the employee may perform such modified assignments. Once a modified work assignment is made and another person is injured, the second person must wait until a modified work opening occurs, regardless of seniority. All modified work assignments must be made in strict compliance with the physical restrictions as outlined by the attending physician. All modified work program candidates must be released for eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week. The Employer at its option, may make a modified work offer of less than eight (8) hours per day where such work is expected to accelerate the rehabilitative process and the attending physician recommends that the employee works back to regular status or up to eight (8) hours per day by progressively increasing daily hours. A copy of any release for modified work must be given to the employee before the modified work assignment begins.
It is understood and agreed that those employees who, consistent with professional medical evaluations and opinion, may not be expected to receive an unrestricted medical release, or whose injury has been medically determined to be permanent and stationary, shall not be eligible to participate in a modified work program.
In the event of a dispute related to conflicting medical opinion, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to established worker's compensation law and/or the method of resolving such matters as outlined in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. In the absence of a provision in the Supplemental Agreement, the following shall apply:
When there is a dispute between two (2) physicians concerning the release of an employee for modified work, such two (2) physicians shall immediately select a third (3rd) neutral physician within seven (7) days, who shall possess the same qualifications as the most qualified of the two selecting physicians, whose opinion shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the employee. In the event the availability of a qualified physician is in question, the Local Union and the Company shall resolve such matter by selecting the third (3rd) physician whose opinion shall be final and binding. The expense of the third (3rd) physician shall be equally divided between the Employer and the Union. Disputes concerning the selection of the neutral physician or back wages shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
For locations where the Employer intends to implement a modified work program or has a modified work program in place, the Local Union shall be provided with a copy of the current form(s) being used for employee evaluation for release and general job descriptions. This information shall be general in nature, not employee specific.
When a modified work assignment is made, the employee shall be provided with the hours and days he/she is scheduled to work as well as the nature of the work to be performed in writing. A copy of this notice shall also be
 
submitted to the Local Union.
An employee who is placed in a modified work position may be subject to medical evaluation(s) by a physician selected by the Employer to determine if the modified work being performed is accelerating the rehabilitative process as anticipated by Section 2 above. In the event such medical evaluation(s) determine that the rehabilitative process is not being accelerated, the employee shall have the right to seek a second opinion from a physician of his choosing. Any disputes regarding conflicting medical claims shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions outlined above. The employee may be removed from the modified work program based upon final medical findings under this procedure. Employees so removed shall not have their worker's compensation benefits affected because of such removal. In the event the employee's temporary disability worker's compensation benefit is subject to reduction by virtue of an applicable Federal or State statute, the Employer shall pay the difference between the amount of the reduced temporary worker's compensation benefit to which the employee would be entitled.
     (d) Modified work shall be restricted to the type of work that is not expected to result in a re-injury and which can be performed within the medical limitations set forth by the attending physician. In the event the employee, in his/her judgment, is physically unable to perform the modified work assigned, he/she shall be either reassigned modified work within his/her physical capabilities or returned to full "temporary total" worker's compensation benefits. In the event a third (3rd) party insurance carrier refuses to reinstate such employee to full temporary total disability benefits, the Employer shall be required to pay the difference between the amount of the benefit paid by such third (3rd) party insurer and full total temporary disability benefits.
Determination of physical capabilities shall be based on the attending physicians medical evaluation. Under no conditions will the injured employee be required to perform work at that location subject to the terms and conditions of the National Master Freight Agreement or its Area Supplemental Agreements. Prior to acceptance of modified work, the affected employee shall be furnished a written job description of the type of work to be performed.
     (e) The modified workday and workweek shall be established by the Employer within the limitations set forth by the attending physician. However, the workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours, inclusive of coffee breaks where applicable and exclusive of a one-half- (1/2) hour meal period and the workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours, Monday through Friday, or Tuesday through Saturday, unless the nature of the modified work assignment requires a scheduled workweek to include Sunday. Whenever possible, the Employer will schedule modified work during daylight hours, Monday through Friday, or during the same general working hours and on the same workweek that the employee enjoyed before he/she became injured. In the case of an employee whose workdays and/or hours routinely varied, the Employer will schedule the employee based on the availability of the modified assignment being offered. Any alleged abuse of the assignment of workdays and work hours shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
     (f) Modified work time shall be considered as time worked when necessary to satisfy vacation and sick leave eligibility requirements as set forth in the National Master Freight Agreement and/or its applicable Area Supplemental Agreements. In addition to earned vacation pay as set forth in the applicable Area Supplemental Agreements, employees accepting modified work shall receive prorated vacation pay for modified work performed based on the weekly average modified work pay. The only time modified work is used in prorating vacation is when the employee did not qualify under the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
Holiday pay shall first be paid in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement as it relates to on-the-job injuries. Once such contractual provisions have been satisfied, holidays will be paid at the modified work rate which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit.
Sick leave and funeral leave taken while an employee is performing modified work will be paid at the modified work rate, which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit. Unused sick leave will be paid at the applicable contract rate where the employee performed modified work and qualified for the sick leave during the contract year.
     (g) The Employer shall continue to remit contributions to the appropriate health & welfare and pension trusts during the entire time period employees are performing modified work. The payment of health & welfare and pension contributions while the employee is on modified work is not included in the health & welfare and pension contributions required by the Supplement when an employee is off work on worker's compensation. Continuation of such contributions beyond the period of time specified in the Supplemental Agreement for on-the-job injury shall be required. Provisions of this Section shall not be utilized as a reason to disqualify or remove an employee from the modified work program.
 
     (h) Employees accepting modified work shall receive temporary partial benefits as determined by each respective state worker's compensation law, plus a modified work wage when added to such temporary partial benefit, shall equal not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of forty (40) hours' pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to under the provisions of the applicable Area Supplemental Agreement for the first six (6) months from the date the modified work assignment commences. After this initial six (6) month period, the percentage shall increase to ninety percent (90%) for the duration of each individual modified work assignment. The Employer shall not refuse to assign modified work to employees based solely on such employees reaching the ninety percent (90%) wage level. Such refusal shall be considered an abuse of the program and shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Modified work assignments beginning or ending within a workweek shall be paid on a prorated basis; one (1) day equals one-fifth (1/5th).
     (i) Employees accepting modified work shall not be subject to disciplinary action provisions of the Supplemental Agreements unless such violation involves an offense for which no prior warning notice is required under the applicable Supplemental Agreement (Cardinal Sins). Additionally, the provisions of Article 35, Section 3(a), shall apply.
     (j) Alleged abuses of the modified work program by the Employer and any factual grievance or request for interpretation concerning this Article shall be submitted directly to the Regional Joint Area Committee. Proven abuses may result in a determination by the National Grievance Committee that would withdraw the benefits of this Article from that Employer, in whole or in part, in which case affected employees shall immediately revert to full worker's compensation benefits.
Section 3. Worker's Compensation Pay Dispute
Should an employee have an undisputed pay claim concerning the established state worker compensation amount required by Law, the Employer will provide each individual an emergency dispute phone number which will be operational twenty-four (24) hours, seven (7) days a week. The Employer's Work Compensation Manager will have authority to make immediate payment. The pay shortage will be reconciled by check delivered by express overnight mail within twenty-four (24) hours of the call. If the disputed pay is not received within the twenty-four- (24) hour period, an eight- (8) hour penalty will be paid the employee for every day until the pay is received.
Section 4. Americans with Disabilities Act
The Union and the Employer recognize their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is agreed that the Employer shall determine whether an employee is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and, if so, what reasonable accommodations, if any, should be provided. In the event that the Employer determines that a reasonable accommodation is necessary, the Employer shall notify the Local Union before providing the reasonable accommodation to a qualified bargaining unit employee to ensure that the reasonable accommodation selected by the Employer does not impact another employee's seniority or other contract rights.
Any dispute over whether the Employer complied with its duty to notify the Local Union before implementing a proposed reasonable accommodation or whether providing the reasonable accommodation violates any employee's rights under any other provision of the NMFA shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Disputes over whether the Employer has complied with its legal requirements under the ADA, including the ADA requirements to provide a reasonable accommodation, however, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Employees in service in the uniformed services of the United States, as defined by the provisions of the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), Title 38, U.S. Code Chapter 43, shall be granted all rights and privileges provided by USERRA and/or other applicable state and federal laws. This shall include continuation of health coverage to the extent required by USERRA, and continuation of pension contributions for the employee's period of service as provided by USERRA. Employee shall be subject to all obligations contained in USERRA which must be satisfied for the employees to be covered by the statute.
 
In addition to any contribution required under USERRA, the Employer shall continue to pay health & welfare contributions for regular active employees involuntarily called to active duty status from the military reserves or the National Guard for military-related service, excluding civil domestic disturbances or emergencies. Such contributions shall only be paid for a maximum period of eighteen (18) months.
Preamble
It is agreed that all parties covered by this Agreement shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations pertaining to worker safety and health and subjects covered by Article 16. Failure to do so shall be subject to the grievance procedure, in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the NMFA, and any other remedies prescribed by law after the procedures contained in this Agreement are exhausted. Class A casual mechanics will not be allowed to sign off safety related write ups.
Section 1. Safe Equipment
The Employer shall not require employees to take out on the streets or highways any vehicle that is not in a safe operating condition, including, but not limited to, equipment which is acknowledged as overweight or not equipped with the safety appliances prescribed by law. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement or basis for discipline where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified.
It shall also not be a violation of this Agreement or considered an unjustified refusal where employees refuse to operate a vehicle when such operation constitutes a violation of any federal rules, regulations, standards, or orders applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety or health, or because of the employee's reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself/herself or the public due to the unsafe condition of such equipment. The unsafe conditions causing the employee's apprehension of injury must be of such nature that a reasonable person, under the circumstances then confronting the employee, would conclude that there is a bona fide danger of an accident, injury, or serious impairment of health, resulting from the unsafe condition.
In order to qualify for protection under this provision, the employee must have sought from the Employer, and have been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.
All equipment which is refused because it is not mechanically sound or properly equipped shall be appropriately tagged so that it cannot be used by other employees until the maintenance department has adjusted the complaint. After such equipment is repaired, the Employer shall place on such equipment an "ok" in a conspicuous place so the employee can see the same.
Section 2. Dangerous Conditions
Under no circumstances will an employee be required or assigned to engage in any activity involving dangerous conditions of work, or danger to person or property or in violation of any applicable statute or court order, or in violation of a government regulation relating to safety of person or equipment.
The term "dangerous conditions of work" does not relate to the type of cargo which is hauled or handled.
Section 3. Accident Reports
Any employee involved in any accident or cargo spill incident, involving any hazardous or potentially polluting product, shall immediately report said accident or spill incident and any physical injury sustained. When required by his/her Employer, the employee, before starting his/her next shift, shall make out an accident or incident report in writing on forms furnished by the Employer and shall turn in all available names and addresses of witnesses to the accident or incident. The employee shall receive a copy of the accident or incident report that he/she submits to his/her Employer. Failure to comply with this provision shall subject such employee to disciplinary action by the Employer.
 
Section 4. Equipment Reports
Employees shall immediately, or at the end of their shift, report all defects of equipment.
     (a) Such reports shall be made on a suitable form furnished by the Employer and shall be made in multiple copies, one (1) copy to be retained by the employee and one (1) copy to be made available for inspection by the next driver operating the unit. Such copy will remain in the truck. Any alleged violation of the above shall not be cause for refusal of the equipment, but shall be subject to the grievance procedure. The Employer shall not ask or require any employee to take out equipment that has been reported by any other employee as being in an unsafe operating condition until the same has been repaired or is certified by a mechanical department that no repairs are needed and the unit is safe to drive.
     (b) When the occasion arises where an employee gives written report on forms in use by the Employer of a vehicle being in an unsafe working or operating condition and receives no consideration from the Employer, he/she shall take the matter up with the officers of the Union who will take the matter up with the Employer. However, in no event shall an employee be required to take out on the streets or highways a vehicle that is not in a safe operating condition or in violation of any federal rules, regulations, standards, or orders applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety as provided in Section 1 of this Article.
Section 5. Qualifications on Equipment
If the Employer or government agency requests a regular employee to qualify on equipment requiring a classified or special license, or in the event an employee is required to qualify (recognizing seniority) on such equipment in order to obtain a better job opportunity with his/her Employer, the Employer shall allow such regular employee the use of the equipment so required in order to take the examination on the employee's own time.
Costs of such license required by a government agency will be paid for by the employee.
An employee unable to successfully pass the DOT Commercial Driver's License (CDL) examination will be allowed to take a leave of absence for a period not to exceed one (1) year provided the employee makes a bona fide effort to pass the test each time the opportunity presents itself.
Once obtained an employee must maintain his/her commercial driver's license with required endorsements unless disqualified by regulatory mandate or documented medical disability.
Section 6. Equipment Requirements
     (a) All tractors must be equipped as necessary to allow the driver to safely enter and exit the cab, and hook and unhook the air hoses.

This will not apply to triple runs as the length now prohibits. However, if and when it becomes legal to run walk-in sleepers on triple lanes, all new equipment ordered after that effective date will be equipped with walk-in sleeper berths.
     (5) All sleeper tractors introduced into Employer linehaul operations after April 1, 2008 will be equipped with an engine and/or exhaust brake. The parties understand that a unit with an inoperable engine brake system will not be considered out of service. Repairs will be performed at the team's home terminal at the end of that team's tour.
     (6) All sleeper tractors will be set so that the unit will continue to idle, except if (a) federal, state, or local laws or regulations require the Employer to limit or eliminate tractor idle time or (b) the unit is equipped with an auxiliary power pack that provides heat and air conditioning to the sleeper berth area.

     (z) All linehaul tractors introduced into Employer linehaul operations after April 1, 2008 will be equipped with a cab filter system that is designed and available from the tractor's manufacturer.
     (aa) The Employer understands tractor interiors should be maintained in a clean condition so units are safe to operate. Concerns about the cleanliness of tractor interiors must first be raised and reviewed at the local level. In the event the parties are unable to resolve the issue locally, the parties shall refer the issue to the Employer's V.P. or Equipment Services for resolution.
Section 7. National Safety, Health & Equipment Committee
The Employer and the Union shall continue the National Safety, Health & Equipment Committee. Such Committee shall be comprised of qualified representatives to consider safety, health and equipment issues.

Parties must update the Hazardous Materials Program guidelines with the understanding that the Union and the Employer will revise the hazardous materials program and address only the mandated requirements.
Section 9. Union Liability
Nothing in this Agreement or its Supplements relating to health, safety or training rules or standards shall create any liability or responsibility on behalf of the Union for any job-related injury or accident to any employee or any other person. Further, the Employer will not commence legal action against the Union as a result of the Union's negotiation of safety standards contained in this Agreement or failure to properly investigate or follow-up Employer compliance with those safety standards.
Section 10. Government Required Safety & Health Reports
The Employer shall provide, upon written request by the Local Union, a copy of any occupational incident report that is required to be filed with a federal government agency on safety and health subjects addressed by Article 16 only. Such reports shall be free of charge for one (1) copy.

The employer agrees to maintain clean restrooms and break rooms on a regular basis throughout the day.
Suitable windshield/window cleaning materials shall be available to include a long handled brush/squeegee.
Every effort will be made to accommodate drivers who are away from their home terminal at the conclusion of a pay period to ensure that those drivers are paid on a timely basis.
In the event an Employer, party to this Agreement, may require the services of employees coming under the jurisdiction of this Agreement in a manner and under conditions not provided for in this Agreement, then and in such instances the Local Union and the Employer concerned may negotiate such matters for such specific purposes, subject to the approval of the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee.
Section 1. Posting of Agreement
A copy of this Agreement shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each garage and terminal.

The Employer agrees to provide suitable space for the union bulletin board in each garage, terminal or place of work. Postings by the Union on such boards are to be confined to official business of the Union.
All Union bulletin boards must be glass encased and the steward and Business Agent given a key. The Employer shall have 90 days to comply.
Section 1. Fair Day's Work for Fair Day's Pay
The parties agree at all times as fully as it may be within their power to cooperate so as to protect the longrange interests of the employees, the Employers signatory to this Agreement, the Union and the general public served by the members of the trucking industry party to this Agreement.
The Union and the Employer recognize the principle of a fair days work for a fair days pay; that jobs and job security of employees working under this Agreement are best protected through efficient and productive operations of the Employer and the trucking industry; and that this principle shall be recognized in the administration of this Agreement and its Supplements and the resolution of all grievances thereunder.
 
Section 2. Joint Industry Development Committee
The parties recognize that the unionized LTL industry is losing market share and jobs to competitors. The parties recognize that it is in the interest of the Union and the Employers to return the LTL industry to health and to foster its growth. Only if the industry prospers and grows will the industry's employees, whom the Union represents, achieve true job and economic security. Only if the industry prospers and grows will the industry have access to the resources it needs to capitalize and be competitive.
Recognizing that returning the industry to health should be a cooperative, longterm effort, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee ("TNFINC") and the Employer Association agree to establish a Joint Industry Development Committee to serve as a vehicle for this effort. The purpose of the Committee will be to perform the following tasks: address the principles of an intermodal truckload agreement as a means of capturing new market and creating additional city/P&D jobs; develop data to evaluate and monitor industry and competitor productivity, costs and operations; catalogue, compare and evaluate work rules, practices and procedures among the various NMFA supplements and the Employer Association's companies; make joint recommendations to the parties about any changes in the NMFA and its supplements that the Committee believes should be considered in the next round of negotiations for the new NMFA; solicit grants for joint activities that benefit the industry and its bargaining unit employees, such as driver training schools; and monitor pending legislation and executive action on the national, state and local level that may affect the welfare of the industry and, where appropriate, jointly recommend actions that further the interests of the industry and its bargaining unit employees and jointly present the views of the Joint Committee to legislative and executive bodies.
The Committee shall operate as a labor management committee within the meaning of Section 302(c) (9) of the LMRA, as amended, established and functioning so as to fulfill one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 6(c)(2) of the Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978. The Committee shall have the full support of both the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Employer Association in the Committee's efforts to identify problems, formulate plans to solve those problems and, where appropriate, conduct joint activities designed to implement the plans.
The Chairman of TNFINC will appoint five (5) Union representatives to the Joint Committee. The Employer Association will appoint five (5) Employer representatives to the Joint Committee. Appointments to the Joint Committee will be made in a manner to assure that there are persons serving who are familiar with the full range of operations undertaken by Employer Association's carriers under all supplemental agreements. The Joint Committee shall meet at least quarterly and may appoint continuing subcommittees to carry out specific tasks. The Union and Employer representatives to the Joint Committee will establish procedures for the operation of this Committee.
Section 3. Benefits Joint Committee
The Union and the Employers will establish a Benefits Joint Committee to review the provision of health & welfare and pension benefits to employees covered by this Agreement. This Committee is charged with the critical responsibility of ensuring that employee health & welfare and pension benefits are made available to employees covered by the terms of the NMFA in a secure and cost-efficient manner. It is anticipated that this Committee shall serve as a source of continuing study regarding the most efficient manner of providing benefits to covered employees. The Union and the Employers will establish procedures for the operation of this Committee. The Committee will make periodic reports and recommendations to TNFINC and TMI.
Section 4. New Business/Job Creation Opportunities
The parties recognize that there may be new job opportunities in markets and/or services not currently performed under the Agreement. During the term of the Agreement, the Employer may propose to TNFINC a new business opportunity which would increase Teamster jobs. The Employer's proposal to TNFINC must contain a detailed description of the proposed new business opportunity and the specific protections to ensure that the proposal will not impact bargaining unit employees. In no event shall the Employer's new business opportunity proposal have an adverse impact on existing bargaining unit employees, the work performed by the bargaining unit, or violate any of the bargaining unit employees' contract rights. The Employer's proposal must be approved by TNFINC and by the Union Supplemental Negotiating Committees and Local Unions in the Supplemental Areas where the proposed new business opportunities exist.
 
Any employee, member of the Union, acting in any official capacity whatsoever shall not be discriminated against for his/her acts as such officer of the Union so long as such acts do not interfere with the conduct of the Employer's business, nor shall there be any discrimination against any employee because of Union membership or activities.
A Union member elected or appointed to serve as a Union official shall be granted a leave of absence during the period of such employment, without discrimination or loss of seniority rights, and without pay.
In the event the Employer employs employee owner-operators, the Employer will negotiate the wages, benefits and working conditions for these owner-operators with TNFINC.
The Employer must mail earnings to discharged employees by certified mail the next business day, unless the employee is paid by direct deposit. The foregoing shall not apply to unused vacation unless required otherwise by law. Vacation pay for which the discharged employee is qualified shall be paid no later than the first (1st) day following final determination of the discharge.
Upon a permanent terminal closing and/or cessation of operations, the Employer shall pay all money due to the employee during the first (1st) payroll department working day following the date of the terminal closing and/or cessation of operations.
Failure to comply shall subject the Employer to pay liquidated damages in the amount of eight (8) hour's pay for each day of delay. Upon quitting, the Employer shall pay all money due to the employee on the next regular payday for the week in which the resignation occurs.
Authorized agents of the Union shall have access to the Employer's establishment during working hours for the purpose of adjusting disputes, investigating working conditions, collection of dues, and ascertaining that the Agreement is being adhered to; provided, however, there is no interruption of the firm's working schedule.
Company representatives, if not known to the employee, shall identify themselves to employees prior to taking disciplinary action.
Safety or other company vehicles shall be identified when stopping company equipment.
Should the Employer find it necessary to require employees to carry or record full personal identification, such requirement shall be complied with by the employees. The cost of such personal identification shall be borne by the Employer. No employee will be required to have their drivers license reproduced in any manner except by their employer, law enforcement agencies, government facilities and facilities operating under government contracts that require such identification to enter the facility.
 
If any article or section of this Agreement or of any Supplements thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any article or section should be restrained by such tribunal pending a final determination as to its validity, the remainder of this Agreement and of any Supplements thereto, or the application of such article or section to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or as to which compliance with or enforcement of has been restrained, shall not be affected thereby.
In the event that any article or section is held invalid or enforcement of or compliance with which has been restrained, as above set forth, the parties affected thereby shall enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations after receipt of written notice of the desired amendments by either Employer or Union for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such article or section during the period of invalidity or restraint. There shall be no limitation of time for such written notice. If the parties do not agree on a mutually satisfactory replacement within sixty (60) days after receipt of the stated written notice, either party shall be permitted all legal or economic recourse in support of its demands notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary.
Section 1. Time Sheets and Time Clocks
In over-the-road or line operations, the Employer shall provide and require the employee to keep a time sheet or trip card showing the arrival and departure at terminal and intermediate stops and cause and duration of all delays, time spent loading and unloading, and same shall be turned in at the end of each trip. In local cartage operations, a daily time record shall be maintained by the Employer at its place of business. All Employers who employ five (5) or more people at any terminal shall have time clocks at such terminals.
Employees shall punch their own time cards.
The Employer shall maintain sign-in and sign-out records at terminals. All road drivers must record their name, home domicile, origin, destination and arrival and/or departure times. The Employer shall make available upon the written request of a Local Union information regarding the destination of loads and/or where loads were loaded within the time limits set forth in the grievance procedure.
The Employer may substitute updated time recording equipment for time cards and time sheets. However, a paper trail shall be maintained.
The Employer may computerize the sign-in and sign-out records. However, at all times, the Union shall have reasonable access to a paper record of the sign-in and sign-out records.
Section 2. Use of Video Cameras for Discipline and Discharge
The Employer may not use video cameras to discipline or discharge an employee for reasons other than theft of property or dishonesty. If the information on the video tape is to be used to discipline or discharge an employee, the Employer must provide the Local Union, prior to the hearing, an opportunity to review the video tape used by the Employer to support the discipline or discharge. Where a Supplement imposes more restrictive conditions upon use of video cameras for discipline or discharge, such restrictions shall prevail.
The Employer shall not install or use video cameras in areas of the Employer's premises that violate the employee's right to privacy such as in bathrooms or places where employees change clothing or provide drug or alcohol testing specimens.
 
Section 3. Computer Tracking Devices
Computer tracking devices, commonly known as "Black Boxes", mandated by regulations shall not be used for disciplinary purposes, except in those incidents of violations of Federal Mandated Regulations or when an employee has intentionally committed malicious damage to the Employer's equipment or when an employee has unsafely operated the Employer's commercial motor vehicles.
In the event of war, declaration of emergency, imposition of mandatory economic controls, the adoption of national health care or any congressional or federal agency action which has a significantly adverse effect on the financial structure of the trucking industry or adverse impact on the wages, benefits or job security of the employees, during the life of this Agreement, either party may reopen the same upon sixty (60) days' prior written notice and request renegotiation of the provisions of this Agreement directly affected by such action.
Upon the failure of the parties to agree in such negotiations within the subsequent sixty- (60) day period, thereafter, either party shall be permitted all lawful economic recourse to support its request for revisions. If governmental approval of revisions should become necessary, all parties will cooperate to the utmost to attain such approval. The parties agree that the notice provided herein shall be accepted by all parties as compliance with the notice requirements of applicable law, so as to permit economic action at the expiration thereof.
In the event of a labor dispute between any Employer, party to this Agreement, and any International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union, parties to this or any other International Brotherhood of Teamsters' Agreement, during the course of which dispute such Union engages in lawful economic activities which are not in violation of this or such other Agreement, then any other affiliate of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, having an agreement with such Employer shall have the right to engage in lawful economic activity against such Employer in support of the above first mentioned Union notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' Agreement between such Employer and such other affiliate, with all of the protection provided in Article 9.
Section 1. Piggyback Operations
     (a) An Employer shall not use piggyback over the same route where the Employer has established relay runs or through runs except to move overflow freight or as otherwise provided in Section 3 herein.
     (b) It is recognized and agreed that there were two distinct and separate types of rail operations in effect on April 1, 1994: (1) the use of rail to move overflow freight; and (2) approved and/or agreed to rail operations. Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 1 shall apply in its entirety to the overflow rail operations. This Section 1 shall only apply to the approved and/or agreed to rail operations to the extent it has been historically applied prior to April 1, 1994.
If a driver is available (which includes the two (2)hour period of time prior to end of his/her rest period) at point of origin when a trailer leaves the yard for the piggyback ramp, such driver's runaround compensation shall start from the time the trailer leaves the yard. Available regular drivers at relay points shall be protected against runarounds if a violation occurred at the point of origin.
If the Employer does not have an over-the-road domicile at the point of origin, the Employer shall protect against
 
runaround the available drivers at the first relay point over which the freight would normally move had it not been placed on the rail. Available regular drivers at relay points shall be protected against runaround if a violation occurred at the first relay point.
The Employer shall not reduce or fail to increase the road driver complement, including the addition of equipment, at the point of origin for the purpose of creating an overflow of freight to avoid the application of this Section.
     (c) When an Employer utilizes Piggyback operations as a substitute service to deliver overflow loads and such substitute service is matched in both directions (East to West and West to East or North to South and South to North), it is understood and agreed by the parties that the Employer will be required to add a sufficient number of employees and the necessary amount of equipment to move trailers over the road when the volume of matched loads reaches a level to insure efficient utilization of equipment and regular work opportunity for the added employees.
It is the intent of the parties in this Section 1 to maximize the movement of freight over the Employer's established relay runs, thereby minimizing the use of substitute service.
     The record keeping requirement set out in Section 2 below will provide the Union with the basis of monitoring the use of such piggyback operation.
     (d) The Employer agrees the non-employee owner-operators, birdy-back, fishy-back and barge operations will not be used over the same routes where the Employer has established relay runs during the term of this Agreement.
Section 2. Maintenance of Records
     (a) Trailers piggybacked as a substitute service as provided in Section 1 are to be signed in and signed out on the regular dispatch sheet in road operations, and where there are no road operations sign-in and sign-out sheets shall be maintained at an appropriate location, including trailers taken to and from the rail yard by city employees. These sheets will be made available, upon request, to the drivers for a period of thirty (30) days. The Employer shall report in writing on a monthly basis to the Local Union at the rail origin point, or in cases where there are no drivers domiciled at the rail origin point to the Local Union at the first driver relay point affected, the number of trailers put on the rail at the rail origin point. The Employer shall also report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer's yard for the rail yard. The time limits set forth in the Supplemental Agreement for filing claims based upon the monthly report shall commence to run upon the receipt of the report by the Local Union.
     (b) With regard to use of substitute service as provided in Section 1, full and complete records of handling, dispatch and movement of such units system-wide shall be kept by the Employer and a report, which will include the date of all outbound rail movement, all points of origin and destination, all trailer numbers and the name of each railroad/routing, shall be sent on a quarterly basis to the office of the National Freight Director and the affected Area Regional Freight Director.
Where inspection of the records indicates that piggyback is being used as a substitute for road operations, as defined in Section 1 of this Article, over an established relay, rather than handling overflow traffic, the grievance procedure may be invoked at the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee by the Regional Freight Coordinator or the office of the National Freight Director to provide a reasonable remedy for the improper usage of piggyback, including the revocation of the use of substitute service, for repeated violations over such relay.
     (c) With regard to trailers moved on rail as an approved intermodal operations set forth in Section 3, the Employer shall report in writing on a monthly basis to each Local Union affected, the number of trailers put on the rail at the rail origin points of the approved intermodal operations. The Employer shall also report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer's yard for the rail yard.
In addition, the Employer shall, on a quarterly basis, send to the office of the National Freight Director a report containing the total intermodal rail miles as reported on line 6 of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Schedule 600 annual report and the total miles as reported on line 7 of the BTS Schedule 600 annual report.
     (d) With regard to the use of a Preferred Company as provided in Section 6, the Employer shall report in
 
writing on a monthly basis to each Local Union affected, the number of trailers tendered to any Preferred Company. The Employer also shall report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer's yard.
In addition, the Employer shall, on a quarterly basis, send to the office of the National Freight Director a report containing the total number of miles the Employer utilized any Preferred Company consistent with the requirements of Article 29, Section 6.
Section 3. Intermodal Service
     (a) The parties recognize that in 1991, Congress passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and declared the policy of the United States to be one of promoting the development of a national intermodal transportation system consisting of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner. The parties have, therefore, entered into this Agreement to enhance the Employer's opportunities to secure the benefits which flow from this national policy of encouraging intermodal transportation, including long-term stable and secure employment. At the same time, the parties recognize the need to minimize and provide for the impact which intermodal operations may have on certain employees covered by this Agreement.
     
(b) Use of Intermodal Service
     1. Subject to the conditions set forth hereinafter, an Employer may establish a new intermodal service over the same route where the Employer has established relay runs or through runs.
Present relay or through operations may not be reduced, modified or changed in any other manner as the result of the implementation of a new intermodal service until such time as the proposed intermodal operation has been approved by the National Intermodal Committee. The Employer shall submit to the National Intermodal Committee an application for approval which shall identify the road operation(s) the intended intermodal service will reduce and/or eliminate; a list identifying the name and seniority date of each driver affected by the intended intermodal service(s); and a list by domicile of each of the road drivers openings available.
In the event the National Intermodal Committee is unable to agree on whether or not the Employer's proposed intermodal operations meet the criteria set forth below, the proposed operation shall not be approved until such time as those issues are resolved. This provision shall not be utilized as a method to delay and/or deny a proposed intermodal operation when the criteria set forth below have been clearly satisfied.
     (a) There shall be no more than two (2) intermodal changes approved during the term of this Agreement; and
     (b) No more than ten (10) percent of the Employer's total active road driver seniority list as of April 1, 1998 shall be affected by the intermodal changes approved during the term of this Agreement.
In the event a proposed intermodal operation also includes the relocation of work that is subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6, the proposed intermodal operations and the relocation of work subject to Article 8, Section 6, may be heard by a combined National Intermodal/Change of Operations Committee on a joint record, and the seniority rights of all affected employees shall be determined by such Committee, which shall have the authority granted in Article 8, Section 6(g).
     2. An approved intermodal operation that provides service over established relay and/or through operations shall include protection for all bid drivers during each dispatch day and all extra board drivers during each dispatch week at each of the affected domiciles.
For purposes of determining the weekly protection for extra board drivers, the affected driver's average weekly earnings during the previous four (4) week period in which the driver had normal earnings shall be considered the weekly protection when violations occur.
     3. When transporting any shipment by intermodal service within the Employer's terminal network, the Employer shall utilize its drivers subject to the applicable respective area supplemental agreements to pickup such shipments from the shipper at point of origin and/or the Employer's terminal and deliver them to the applicable intermodal exchange point. The Employer also shall use its drivers to deliver intermodal shipments to the consignee
 
or the Employer's terminal. A driver may be required to drive through other terminal service areas to the intermodal exchange point to pickup and deliver intermodal shipments without penalty.
     4. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of the Article, total intermodal rail miles included on line 303 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report shall not exceed 28 percent of the Employer's total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. In the event intermodal rail miles exceed this 28 percent maximum, the Employer shall be required to remove an appropriate amount of freight from the rail and add a corresponding number of drivers at each affected domicile.
The parties recognize that the current shipping markets demand expedited delivery of freight in a manner that may not be accomplished by hauling certain freight by rail. These market demands create a need to reduce the amount of freight hauled by rail and to use alternative methods of substitute service. As contemplated by Article 20, Section 4, new business opportunities may be pursued that promote new Teamster job opportunities while protecting existing Teamster jobs, benefits and working conditions. With these facts in mind, the rail miles as a percentage of total miles will be reduced as follows: effective Calendar Year 2010, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 24% to 21.5%. Effective Calendar Year 2011, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 21% to 21%. Effective Calendar Year 2012, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 21% to 19%. The reduction in rail miles during the term of this Agreement is subject to the provisions of Article 29, Section 6.
The National Intermodal Committee shall establish rules and guidelines that will allow the Union the opportunity to verify and audit the Employer's BTS rail reports. In the event the Union establishes through the grievance procedure that an Employer has falsified the BTS reports in order to increase the maximum amount of intermodal rail miles permitted under this Article, the remedy for such a violation shall include a cessation of the Employer's affected intermodal service until such time as the issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Union. In the event the BTS rail and/or line haul miles reporting requirements are modified and/or eliminated, the parties will meet to develop a substitute reporting procedure consistent with those of the BTS.
     
(c) Job Protections for Current Road Drivers
     1. Rail operations that are subject to the provisions of Section 1(b) above shall not result in the layoff or involuntary relocation of any driver at any affected road driver domicile.
     2. During the term of this Agreement, an Employer shall be permitted no more than two (2) Intermodal Changes whereby the Employer may reduce and/or eliminate existing road operation(s) through the use of intermodal service. It is specifically agreed that a total of no more than ten (10) percent of the Employer's total active road driver seniority list as of April 1, 2003, shall be affected by the Intermodal Changes during the term of this Agreement.
Any road driver who is adversely affected by an approved Intermodal Operation and would thereby be subject to layoff, or who is on layoff at an affected domicile at the time an Intermodal Operation is approved, shall be offered work opportunity at other road driver domiciles within the Employer's system. The Employer shall include in its proposed Intermodal Operations specific facts that adequately support the Employer's claims that there will be sufficient freight to support the work opportunities the Employer proposes at each gaining domicile. In the event there is more than one (1) domicile involved, the drivers adversely affected shall be dovetailed on a master seniority list and an opportunity to relocate shall be offered on a seniority basis, subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6. The "hold" procedures set forth in Article 8, Section 6 of the NMFA shall be applicable. Where the source of the proposed work opportunity is presently being performed by bargaining unit employees over the road, the Employer shall be required to make reasonable efforts to fill the offered positions as set forth in Article 8, Section 6(d)(6).
Drivers who relocate under this provision shall be dovetailed on the applicable seniority list at the domicile they bid into. Health & welfare and pension contributions shall be remitted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Section 6(a) and moving and lodging shall be paid in accordance with Article 8, Section 6(c) of the NMFA. It is understood and agreed that the intent of this provision is to provide the maximum job security possible to those drivers affected by the use of intermodal service. Therefore, the number of drivers on the affected seniority lists at rail origin points at the time an intermodal change becomes effective shall not be reduced during the term of this Agreement other than as may be provided in subsequent changes of operations. Drivers on the affected seniority lists at gaining domiciles at the time an intermodal change becomes effective, shall not be permanently laid off during the
 
term of this Agreement.
The senior driver voluntarily laid off at an intermodal losing domicile will be restored to the active board each time foreign drivers or casuals (where applicable) make ten (10) trips (tours of duty) within any thirty (30) calendar day period on a primary run of such domicile, not affected by a Change of Operations.
For the purposes of this Section, short-term layoffs (1) that coincide with normal seasonal freight flow reductions that are experienced on a regional basis and that include a reduction in rail freight that corresponds to the reduction in truck traffic, or (2) that are incidental day-to-day layoffs due to reasons such as adverse weather conditions and holiday scheduling, shall not be considered as a permanent layoff. Layoffs created by a documented loss of a customer shall not exceed thirty (30) days. Any layoff for reasons other than as described above shall be considered as a permanent layoff. The Employer shall have the burden of proving that a layoff is not permanent.
In order to ensure that the work opportunities of the drivers at the gaining domiciles are not adversely affected by the redomiciling of drivers, the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers at a gaining domicile shall not have their earnings reduced below an average weekly earnings of seven hundred dollars ($700). This seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee shall not start until the fourth (4th) week following the implementation of the approved Intermodal Change of Operation.
It is not the intent of this provision to establish a seven hundred dollar ($700) per week as an artificial base wage but rather a minimum guarantee. This provision shall not preclude the short-term layoffs as defined above. The Employer shall have the burden of proving that drivers at the gaining domiciles have not had their work opportunities adversely affected by the redomiciling of drivers.
The seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee shall be determined based on the average four (4) weeks earnings of each active protected driver on the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster. When the earnings of any active protected driver in the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster totals less than two thousand, eight hundred dollars ($2,800) during each four- (4) week period, the driver shall be compensated for the difference between actual earnings and two thousand, eight hundred dollars ($2,800).
The four- (4) week average shall be calculated each week on a "rolling" basis. A "rolling" four- (4) week period is defined as a base week and the previous three consecutive weeks. Where an Employer makes a payment to an employee to fulfill the guarantee, the amount paid shall be added to the employee's earnings for the base week of the applicable four (4) week period and shall be included in the calculations for subsequent four- (4) week "rolling" periods to determine whether any further guarantee payments to the employee are due.
Time not worked shall be credited to drivers for purposes of computing earnings in the following instances:
     a. Where a driver is offered a work opportunity that the driver has a contractual obligation to accept, and the driver elects not to accept such work, the driver shall have an amount equal to the amount of the wages such work would have generated credited to such driver for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
No driver shall be penalized by having contractual earned time off credited for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee. However, where a driver takes earned time off in excess of forty-eight (48) hours during any work week, that work week shall be excluded from the rolling four- (4)week period used to determined the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
     b. Where a driver uses a contractual provision to refuse or defer work so as to knowingly avoid legitimate work opportunity and therefore abuse the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee, the driver shall have an amount equal to the amount of the wages such work would have generated credited to such driver for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
Nothing in this subsection applies to or shall be construed to limit claims by any driver on the seniority roster at a gaining domicile alleging that the driver's work opportunity was adversely affected following the implementation of the Intermodal Change of Operations because of the Employer's failure to provide adequate work opportunities for existing and redomiciled drivers. However, after the point that the Employer has provided adequate work opportunities for protected drivers (existing and redomiciled), the wage protection for active drivers in the bottom
 
twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster shall be limited to the seven hundred dollar ($700) guarantee.
As soon as a factual determination has been made that a driver in the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster is entitled to the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee, the driver's claim shall be paid. All other types of claims that the driver's work opportunities have been adversely affected shall be held in abeyance until determined through the intermodal grievance procedure.
Section 4. National Intermodal Committee
The parties shall establish a National Intermodal Committee composed of four (4) Union representatives appointed by the Union Chairman of the National Grievance Committee and four (4) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. In the event a proposed intermodal operation includes the relocation of work subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6, the National Intermodal Committee shall then be considered as a combined National Intermodal/Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee with the authority to resolve all seniority issues in accordance with the authority granted by Article 8, Section 6(g).
The National Intermodal Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed intermodal operations are to be heard, procedures for resolving intermodal issues and procedures for establishing pre-hearing guidelines.
Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of Article 29, Section 2(c) or concerning any issues that may arise from an approved intermodal operation provided for in this Section 3, shall be first referred to the National Intermodal Committee. If the National Intermodal Committee is unable to reach a decision on an interpretation or grievance, the issue will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
Section 5.
The Employer is prohibited from using rail as a subterfuge to transport freight by truck, driven by those outside of the bargaining unit. To this end, all loads tendered to the railroad shall be tendered by the Employer using bargaining unit employees at the point where the load is to be placed on the rail. Once tendered to the railroad, a load may not be relocated to non-bargaining unit personnel for transport by truck except in bona fide emergencies beyond the control of the Employer and/or the railroad. Such emergencies shall not include the Employer tendering loads to the railroad when the Employer knows or should know the load will not meet the scheduled departure time of the train and the railroad then transports the load by truck. The parties agree that this Subsection shall not apply to the Employer's existing rail operations, that have otherwise been permitted prior to February 8, 1998, by written agreement of the parties, or through a grievance decision. The parties further agree that nothing in this Subsection shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the railroads movements of loads within the metropolitan area between railroads or between tracks. This provision shall apply to all rail activities permitted under this Article.
Section 6.
1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Employer shall be permitted to utilize companies for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service. The parties shall designate at least one (1) Preferred Company for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service under this Section. Until December 31, 2009, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be limited to 4% o f the Employer's total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar Year 2010, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 4% to 6.5% of the Employer's total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar Year 2011, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 6.5% to 7% of the Employer's total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar year 2012, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 7% to 9% of the Employer's total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. In the event the parties fail to designate at least one (1) Preferred Company for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service, the maximum amount of rail miles provided for in Section 3(b)(4) of the Article shall be returned to 26% for the remainder of this Agreement. It is agreed that any Preferred Company utilized under this Section shall be permitted to drop and pick up trailers at the Employer's terminal locations, but shall be required to do so in areas of the terminal specifically designated for such exchange.
 
2. For purposes of the Employer's existing rail origin points as described in Article 20, Section 3, the use of a Preferred Company under this Section over established relay and/or through operations shall include protection for all bid drivers during each dispatch day and all extra board drivers during each dispatch week at the originating domiciles. For purposes of determining the weekly protection for extra board drivers, the affected driver's average weekly earnings during the previous four (4) week period in which the driver had normal earnings shall be considered the weekly protection when violations occur. In the event that the Employer uses a Preferred Company as substitute service, the Article 29, Section 3 job protections for current road drivers shall apply.
3. All disputes arising under this Article 29, Section 6 shall be referred for resolution to the National Review Committee.
In the event that any dispute should arise between any Local Unions, parties to this Agreement or Supplements thereto, or between any Local Union, party to this Agreement or Supplements thereto and any other Union, relating to jurisdiction over employees or operations covered by such Agreements, the Employer and the Local Unions agree to accept and comply with the decision or settlement of the Unions or Union bodies which have the authority to determine such dispute, and such disputes shall not be submitted to arbitration under this Agreement or Supplements thereto or to legal or administrative agency proceedings. Pending such determination, the Employer shall not be precluded from seeking appropriate legal or administrative relief against work stoppages or picketing in furtherance of such dispute.
The parties agree to become a part of the multiemployer, multi-union bargaining unit established by this National Master Freight Agreement, and to be bound by the interpretations and enforcement of this National Master Freight Agreement and Supplements thereto.
Section 1. Work Preservation
For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities for the employees covered by this Agreement, the signatory Employer agrees that no operation, work or services of the kind, nature or type covered by, or presently performed by, or hereafter assigned to, the collective bargaining unit by the signatory Employer will be subcontracted, transferred, leased, diverted, assigned or conveyed in full or in part (hereinafter referred to as "divert" or "subcontract"), by the Employer to any other plant, business, person, or non-unit employees, or to any other mode of operation, unless specifically provided and permitted in this Agreement.
In addition, the signatory Employer agrees that it will not, as hereinafter set forth, subcontract or divert the work presently performed by, or hereafter assigned to, its employees to non-employee owner-operators or other business entities owned and/or controlled by the signatory Employer, or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates.
Section 2. Diversion of Work  Parent or Subsidiary Companies
The parties agree that for purposes of this Article it shall be presumed that a diversion of work in violation of this Agreement occurs when work presently and regularly performed by, or hereafter assigned to, employees of the signatory Employer has been lost and the lost work is being performed in the same manner (including transportation by owner-operators and independent contractors) by an entity owned and/or controlled by the signatory Employer, its parent, or a subsidiary, including logistics companies, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the loss of the
 
work. The burden of overcoming such presumption in the grievance procedure shall be upon the Employer.
Section 3. Subcontracting
The Employer may subcontract work when all of his/her regular employees are working, except that in no event shall road work presently performed or runs established during the life of this Agreement be farmed out. No dock work shall be farmed out except for existing situations established by agreed-to past practices. Overflow loads may be delivered pursuant to the provisions of Article 29. Loads may also be delivered by other agreed-to methods or as presently agreed to. Other persons performing subcontracted work which is permitted herein shall receive no less than the equivalent of the economic terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Supplement.
The signatory Employer shall maintain records identifying persons performing subcontracted work permitted by this Agreement. Said records shall be made available for inspection by the Local Union(s) in the locality affected by such subcontract work.
The normal, orderly interlining of freight for peddle on occasional basis, where there are parallel rights, and when not for the purpose of evading this Agreement, may be continued as has been permitted by past practice provided it is not being done to defeat the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 4. Expansion of Operations
     
(a) Adjoining Over-the-road and Local Cartage
It is understood and agreed that the provisions of the National Master Freight Agreement shall be applied, without evidence of union representation of the employees involved, to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current over-the-road or local cartage operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operations of the signatory Employer, or any other entity, not operated wholly independently of the signatory Employer within the meaning of Article 3, Section 1 (a). In this regard, the parties agree that newly established terminals and consolidations of terminals which are controlled and utilized as part of a current operation will be covered by the National Master Freight Agreement and applicable Over-the-Road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements.
     
(b) New Pickup and Delivery Adjoining Current Operations
It shall not, however, be a violation of this Article if, during the term of this Agreement, an Employer commences pick-up and delivery operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operations with other than its own employees when there is insufficient business to economically justify the establishment of its own employer-operated pick-up and delivery service. However, the above exception shall thereafter terminate when sufficient economic justification develops so as to warrant the establishment and maintenance of the terminal operation by such Employer, in which event, the Employer shall institute a pick-up and delivery operation or continue such operations with companies which maintain wage standards established by this Agreement in the area where the work is conducted. This exception shall not apply in any circumstance where an Employer is presently engaged in pick-up and delivery operations either through his/her own terminal or through companies which maintain such wage standards.
     (c) Non-Adjoining Pick-up and Delivery Operations
The parties further agree that with respect to all subsequently established over-the-road and local cartage operations and terminals of the signatory Employer which do not adjoin, but are utilized and controlled as part of, current over-the-road and local cartage operations, the provisions of Article 2, Section 3(a) shall govern so that when a majority of the eligible employees of the signatory Employer performing work at that location execute a card authorizing a signatory Local Union to represent them as their collective bargaining agent at the terminal location, then, such employees shall automatically be covered by this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements.
(d) Operations permitted by Article 29, and not in violation of any other provisions of this Agreement, are not to be considered as extensions of current operations within the meaning of Section 4.
 
Section 5.
For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities, the National Grievance Committee may define the circumstances and adopt procedures by which an Employer and a Local Union, parties to this Agreement, may in compliance therewith enter into a Special Circumstance Agreement which does not meet the standards provided herein.
Section 6.
Grievances arising under this Article shall be processed on an expedited basis pursuant to the procedures contained in Article 8, Section 1(a).
Section 7. National Subcontracting Review Committee
The parties shall establish a National Subcontracting Review Committee composed of two (2) Union representatives appointed by the Union Chairman of the National Grievance Committee and two (2) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. The National Subcontracting Review Committee shall have the authority to review and adjudicate alleged violations of the work preservation diversion of work and subcontracting provisions of Article 32, including practices by an Employer that are an alleged subterfuge to avoid the requirement of Article 32.
All other grievances arising under this Article shall be processed on an expedited basis pursuant to the procedures contained in Article 8, Section 1(a).
1.
General Wage Increases: Full-Time
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers", CPIW (Revised Series Using 198284 Expenditure Patterns), All Items (198284=100), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor and referred to herein as the "Index".
Effective April 1, 2004, and every April 1 thereafter during the life of the agreement, a cost-of-living allowance will be calculated on the basis of the difference between the Index for January, 2003 (published February 2003) and the Index for January, 2004 (published February 2004) with a similar calculation for every year thereafter, as follows:
For every 0.2 point increase in the Index over and above the base (prior year's) Index plus 3.0%, there will be a 1 cent increase in the hourly wage rates payable on April 1, 2004, and every April 1 thereafter. These increases shall only be payable if they equal a minimum of five cents ($.05) in a year.
All cost-of-living allowances paid under this agreement will become and remain a fixed part of the base wage rate for all job classifications. A decline in the Index shall not result in the reduction of classification base wage rates.
Mileage paid employees will receive cost-of-living allowances on the basis of .25 mills per mile for each 1 cent increase in hourly wages.
 
In the event the appropriate Index figure is not issued before the effective date of the cost-of-living adjustment, the cost-of-living adjustment that is required will be made at the beginning of the first (1st) pay period after the receipt of the Index.
In the event that the Index shall be revised or discontinued and in the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, does not issue information which would enable the Employer and the Union to know what the Index would have been had it not been revised or discontinued, then the Employer and the Union will meet, negotiate, and agree upon an appropriate substitute for the Index. Upon the failure of the parties to agree within sixty (60) days, thereafter, the issue of an appropriate substitute shall be submitted to an arbitrator for determination. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.
In the event of notice to an Employer of a garnishment or impending garnishment, the Employer may take disciplinary action if the employee fails to satisfy such garnishment within a seventy-two (72) hour period (limited to working days) after notice to the employee. However, the Employer may not discharge any employee by reason of the fact that his earnings have been subject to garnishment for any one (1) indebtedness. If the Employer is notified of three (3) garnishments irrespective of whether satisfied by the employee within the seventy-two (72) hour period, the employee may be subject to discipline, including discharge in extreme cases. However, if the Employer has an established practice of discipline or discharge with a fewer number of garnishments or impending garnishments, if the employee fails to adjust the matter within the seventy-two (72) hour period, such past practice shall be applicable in those cases.
Section 1. Employee's Bail
Employees will be bailed out of jail if accused of any offense in connection with the faithful discharge of their duties, and any employee forced to spend time in jail or in courts shall be compensated at his/her regular rate of pay. In addition, he/she shall be entitled to reimbursement for his/her meals, transportation, court costs, etc.; provided, however, that faithful discharge of duties shall in no case include compliance with any order involving commission of a felony. In case an employee shall be subpoenaed as a company witness, he/she shall be reimbursed for all time lost and expenses incurred.
Section 2. Suspension or Revocation of License
In the event an employee receives a traffic citation for a moving violation which would contribute to a suspension or revocation or suffers a suspension or revocation of his/her right to drive the company's equipment for any reason, he/she must promptly notify his/her Employer in writing. Failure to comply will subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. If such suspension or revocation comes as a result of his/her complying with the Employer's instruction, which results in a succession of size and weight penalties or because he/she complied with his/her Employer's instruction to drive company equipment which is in violation of DOT regulations relating to equipment or because the company equipment did not have either a speedometer or a tachometer in proper working order and if the employee has notified the Employer of the citation for such violation as above mentioned, the Employer shall provide employment to such employee at not less than his/her regular earnings at the time of such suspension for the entire period thereof.
When an employee in any job classification requiring driving has his/her operating privilege or license suspended or revoked for reasons other than those for which the employee can be discharged by the Employer, a leave of absence without loss of seniority, not to exceed three (3) years, shall be granted for such time as the employee's operating license has been suspended or revoked. The employee will be given work opportunities ahead of casuals to perform non-CDL required job functions.
 
Section 3. Drug Testing
PREAMBLE
While abuse of alcohol and drugs among our members/employees is the exception rather than the rule, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee and the Employers signatory to this Agreement share the concern expressed by many over the growth of substance abuse in American society.
The parties have agreed that the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Program will be modified in the event that further federal legislation or Department of Transportation regulations provide for revised testing methodologies or requirements. The parties have incorporated the appropriate changes required by the applicable DOT drug testing rules under 49 CFR Parts 40 and 382, and agree that if new federally mandated changes are brought about, they too will become part of this Agreement. The drug testing procedure, agreed to by labor and management, incorporates state-of-the-art employee protections during specimen collection and laboratory testing to protect the innocent and ensures the Employer complies with all applicable DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations. In order to eliminate the safety risks which result from alcohol or drugs, the parties have agreed to the following procedures:
NMFA UNIFORM TESTING PROCEDURE
     
A. Probable Suspicion Testing
In cases in which an employee is acting in an abnormal manner and at least one (1) supervisor, two (2) if available, have probable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of controlled substances and/or alcohol, the Employer may require the employee (in the presence of a union shop steward, if possible) to undergo a urine specimen collection and a breath alcohol analysis as provided in Section 4B. The supervisor(s) must have received training in the signs of drug intoxication in a prescribed training program which is endorsed by the Employer. Probable suspicion means suspicion based on specific personal observations that the Employer representative(s) can describe concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or breath odor of the employee. The observations may include the indication of chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. The supervisor(s) must make a written statement of these observations within twenty-four (24) hours. A copy must be provided to the shop steward or other union official after the employee is discharged. Suspicion is not probable and thus not a basis for testing if it is based solely on third (3rd) party observation and reports. The employee shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under the law. For all purposes herein, the parties agree that the terms "probable suspicion" and "reasonable cause" shall be synonymous.
The following collection procedures shall apply to all types of testing:
A refusal to provide a urine specimen or undertake a breath analysis will constitute a presumption of intoxication and the employee will be subject to discharge without receipt of a prior warning letter. If the employee is unable to produce 45mL of urine, he/she shall be offered up to forty ounces of fluid to drink and shall remain at the collection site under observation until able to produce a 45mL specimen, for a period of up to three (3) hours from the first unsuccessful attempt to provide the urine specimen. If the employee is still unable to produce a 45mL specimen, the Employer shall direct the employee to undergo an evaluation which shall occur within five business days, by a licensed physician, acceptable to the MRO who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee's inability to provide an adequate amount of urine. If the physician and MRO conclude that there is no medical condition that would preclude the employee from providing an adequate amount of urine, the MRO will issue a ruling that the employee refused the test. If an employee is unable to provide sufficient breath sample for analysis, the procedures outlined in the DOT regulations shall be followed for all employees. Such employees shall be evaluated by a licensed physician, acceptable to the Employer, who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee's failure to provide an adequate amount of breath. Absent a medical condition, as determined by the licensed physician, said employee will be regarded as having refused to take the test. The Employer will adhere to DOT regulations for employees who are unable to provide a urine or breath specimen due to a permanent or long-term medical condition. Contractual time limits for disciplinary action, as set forth in the appropriate Supplemental Agreement, shall begin on the day on which specimens are taken. In the event the Employer alleges only that the employee is intoxicated on alcohol and not drugs, previously agreed-to procedures under the appropriate Supplemental Agreement for determining alcohol intoxication shall apply.
 
In the event the Employer is unable to determine whether the abnormal behavior is due to drugs or alcohol, the drug testing procedure contained herein and the breath alcohol testing procedure contained in Section 4B shall be used. If the laboratory results are not known prior to the expiration of the contractual time period for disciplinary action, the cause for disciplinary action shall specify that the basis for such disciplinary action is for "alcohol and/or drug intoxication".
     
B. DOT Random Testing
It is agreed by the parties that random urine drug testing will be implemented only in accordance with the DOT rules under 49 CFR Part 382, Subpart C.
The method of selection for random urine drug testing will be neutral so that all employees subject to testing will have an equal chance to be randomly selected.
The term "employees subject to testing" under this agreement is meant to include any employee required to have a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) under the Department of Transportation regulations.
Employees out on long term injury or disability for any reason shall not be tested.
The provisions of Article 35, Section 3 F 3 (Split Sample Procedures), and Article 35, Section 3 J 1 (One-Time Rehabilitation), shall apply to random urine drug testing.
     
C. Non-suspicion-based post-accident testing
Non-suspicion-based post-accident testing is defined as urine drug testing as a result of an accident which meets the definition of an accident as outlined in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. Urine drug testing will be required after accidents meeting the following conditions and drivers are required to remain readily available for testing for thirty-two (32) hours following the accident or until tested.
Employees subject to non suspicion-based post accident drug testing shall be limited to those employees subject to DOT drug testing, who are involved in an accident where there is:
     (i) a fatality, or;
     (ii) a citation under State or local law is issued to the driver for a moving vehicle violation arising from the accident in which
     (a) bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or
     (b) one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requires the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
The driver has the responsibility to make himself/herself available for urine drug testing within the thirty-two (32) hour period in accordance with the procedures outlined in this Subsection. The driver is responsible to notify the Employer upon receipt of a citation and to note receipt thereof on the accident report. Failure to so notify the Employer shall subject the driver to disciplinary action.
If a driver receives a citation for a moving violation more than thirty-two (32) hours after a reportable accident, he/she shall not be required to submit to post accident urine drug testing. The Employer shall make available a urine drug testing kit and an appropriate collection site for the driver to provide specimens. The provisions of Article 35, Section 3 F 3 (Split Sample Procedures), and Article 35, Section 3 J 1 (One-Time Rehabilitation), shall apply to non-suspicion-based post-accident urine drug testing.
     
D. Chain of Custody Procedures
Any specimens collected for drug testing shall follow the DHHS/DOT (Department of Health and Human Services/ Department of Transportation) specimen collection procedures. At the time specimens are collected for any drug testing, the employee shall be given a copy of the specimen collection procedures. In the presence of the employee,
 
the specimens are to be sealed and labeled. As per DOT regulations, it is the employee's responsibility to initial the seals on the specimen bottles, additionally ensuring that the specimens tested by the laboratory are those of the employee.
The required procedure follows: When urine specimens are to be provided, at least 45 mL of specimen shall be collected. At least 30 mL shall be placed in one (1) self-sealing, screw-capped or snap-capped container. A urine specimen of at least l5mL shall be placed in a second (2nd) such container. They shall be sealed and labeled by the collector, and initialed by the employee without the containers leaving the employee's presence. The employee has the responsibility to identify each container and initial same. Following collection, the specimens shall be placed in the transportation container together with the appropriate copies of the chain of custody form. The transportation container shall then be sealed in the employee's presence. The container shall be sent to the designated testing laboratory at the earliest possible time by the fastest available means.
In this urine collection procedure, the donor shall urinate into a collection container capable of holding at least 55 mL, which shall remain in full view of the employee until transferred to tamper-resistant urine bottles, and sealed and labeled, and the employee has initialed the bottles.
It is recognized that the Specimen Collector is required to check for sufficiency of specimen, acceptable temperature range, and signs of tampering, provided that the employee's right to privacy is guaranteed and in no circumstances may observation take place while the employee is producing the urine specimens, unless required by DOT regulations. If it is established that the employee's specimen is outside of the acceptable temperature range or has been intentionally tampered with or substituted by the employee, the employee will be required to immediately submit an additional specimen under direct observation. Also, if it is established that the employee's specimen has been intentionally tampered with or substituted by the employee, the employee is subject to discipline as if the specimen tested positive. In order to deter adulteration of the urine specimen during the collection process, physiologic determinations for creatinine, specific gravity, pH, and any substances that may be used to adulterate the specimen shall be performed by the laboratory. If the laboratory suspects the presence of an interfering substance/adulterant that could make a test result invalid, but the initial laboratory is unable to identify it, the specimen must be sent to another HHS certified laboratory that has the capability of doing so.
Any findings by the laboratory that indicate that a specimen is adulterated as a result of the fact that it contains a substance that is not expected to be present in human urine; a substance that is expected to be present is identified at a concentration so high that it is not consistent with human urine; or has physical characteristics which are outside the normal expected range for human urine shall be immediately reported to the Company's Medical Review Officer (MRO). The parties recognize that the key to chain of custody integrity is the immediate sealing and labeling of the specimen bottles in the presence of the tested employee. If each container is received undamaged at the laboratory properly sealed, labeled and initialed, consistent with DOT regulations as certified by the laboratory, the Employer may take disciplinary action based upon the MRO's ruling.
     
E. Urine Collection Kits and Forms
The contents of the urine collection kit shall be as follows:
     1. The kit shall include a specimen collection container capable of holding at least fifty-five (55) mL of urine and contains a temperature reading device capable of registering the urine temperature specified in the DOT regulations.
     2. Two (2) plastic bottles that are capable of holding at least thirty-five (35) mL, have screw-on or snap-on caps, and markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels for the primary (30 mL) and split (15 mL) specimens.
     3. A uniquely numbered (i.e. Specimen Identification Number) DOT approved chain of custody form with similarly numbered Bottle Custody Seals, and a transportation kit seal (e.g., Box Seal) shall be utilized during the urine collection process and completed by the collection site person. In the case of probable suspicion or other contractually required testing, a Non-DOT chain of custody form will be used for the testing of Non-DOT employees. The appropriate laboratory copies are to be placed into the transportation container with the urine specimens. The exterior of the transportation kit shall then be secured, e.g., by placing the tamper-proof Box Seal over the outlined area.
 
     4. Shrink-wrapped or similarly protected kits shall be used in all instances.
     
F. Laboratory Requirements
     1. Urine Testing
In testing urine samples, the testing laboratory shall test specifically for those drugs and classes of drugs and adulterants employing the test methodologies and cutoff levels covered in the DOT Regulations 49 CFR, Part 40.
     2. Specimen Retention
All specimens deemed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid by the laboratory, according to the prescribed guidelines, must be retained at the laboratory for a period of one (1) year.
     3. Split Sample Procedure
The split sample procedure is required for all employees selected for urine drug testing. When any test kit is received by the laboratory, the "primary" sealed urine specimen bottle shall be immediately removed for testing, and the remaining "split" sealed specimen bottle shall be placed in secured storage. Such specimen shall be placed in refrigerated storage if it is to be tested outside of the DOT mandated period of time.
The employee will be given a shrink-wrapped or similarly protected urine collection kit. After receiving the specimen, the collector shall pour at least 30 mL of urine into the specimen bottle and at least 15 mL into the second split specimen bottle. Both bottles shall be sealed in the employee's presence, initialed by the employee, then forwarded to an accredited laboratory for testing. If the employee is advised by the MRO that the first (1st) urine sample tested positive, adulterated, or substituted, in a random, return to duty, follow-up, probable suspicion or post accident urine drug test, the employee may, within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the actual notice, request from the MRO that the second (2nd) urine specimen be forwarded by the first laboratory to another independent and unrelated accredited laboratory of the parties' choice for GC/MS confirmatory testing for the presence of the drug, or other confirmatory testing for adulterants, or to confirm that the specimen has been substituted as defined in 49 CFR Part 40. If the employee chooses to have the second (2nd) sample analyzed, he/she shall at that time execute a special check-off authorization form to ensure payment by the employee. Split specimen testing will conform to the regulations as defined in 49 CFR Part 40. If the employee chooses the optional split sample procedure, and so notifies his Employer, disciplinary action can only take place after the MRO reports a positive, adulterated, or substituted result on the primary test and the MRO reports that the testing of the split specimen confirmed the result. However, the employee may be taken out of service once the MRO reports a positive, adulterated, or substituted result based on the testing of the primary specimen while the testing of the split specimen is being performed. If the second (2nd) test confirms the findings of the first laboratory and the employee wishes to use the rehabilitation options of this Section, the employee shall reimburse the Employer for the cost of the second (2nd) sample's analysis before entering the rehabilitation program. If the second (2nd) laboratory report is negative, for drugs, adulterants, or substitution, the employee will be reimbursed for the cost of the second (2nd) test and for all lost time. It is also understood that if an employee opts for the split sample procedure, contractual time limits on disciplinary action in the Supplements are waived.
     4. Laboratory Accreditation
All laboratories used to perform urine drug testing pursuant to this Agreement must be certified by Health and Human Services under the National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP).
     G. Laboratory Testing Methodology
     1. Urine Testing
The initial testing shall be by immunoassay which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. The initial cutoff levels used when screening urine specimens to determine whether they are negative or positive for various classes of drugs shall be those contained in the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs (subject to revision in accordance with subsequent amendments to
 
the HHS Guidelines).
All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. Quantitative GC/MS confirmatory procedures for drugs and confirmatory procedures for specimens that are initially identified as being adulterated or substituted shall comply with the testing protocols mandated by the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs (subject to revision in accordance with subsequent amendments to the HHS Guidelines).
Validity testing shall be conducted on all specimens, pursuant to HHS requirements, to determine whether they have been adulterated or substituted. All specimens which test negative on either the initial test or the GC/MS confirmation test shall be reported only as negative, unless they are confirmed to be adulterated, substituted, or invalid. Only specimens which test positive on both the initial test and the GC/MS confirmation test shall be reported as positive. Specimens that are confirmed to be adulterated or substituted shall be reported as such.
When a grievance is filed as a result of a drug test that is ruled positive, adulterated, or substituted, the Employer shall provide a copy of the MRO ruling to the Union.
Where Schedule I and II drugs are detected, the laboratory is to report a positive test based on a forensically acceptable positive quantum of proof. All positive test results must be reviewed by the certifying scientist and certified as accurate.
     2. Prescription and Non-prescription Medications
If an employee is taking a prescription or non-prescription medication in the appropriate described manner he/she will not be disciplined. Medications prescribed for another individual, not the employee, shall be considered to be illegally used and subject the employee to discipline.
     3. Medical Review Officer (MRO)
The Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall be a licensed physician with the knowledge of substance abuse disorders, issues relating to adulterated and substituted specimens, possible medical causes of specimens having an invalid result, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the MRO shall keep current on applicable DOT agency regulations and comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements. The MRO shall review all urine drug test results from the laboratory and shall examine alternate medical explanations for tests reported as positive, adulterated, or substituted, as well as those results reported as invalid. Prior to the final decision to verify a urine drug test result, all employees shall have the opportunity to discuss the results with the MRO.
If the employee declines to speak with the MRO, or the employee fails to contact the MRO within 72 hours of being notified to do so by the Employer, or if the MRO is unable to contact the employee within ten (10) days of the receipt of the drug test result being reported to him by the laboratory, then the MRO may report the result to the Employer.
     4. Substance Abuse Professional (SAP)
The Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), as provided in the regulations, means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional, or a drug and alcohol counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol & Other Drug Abuse). All must have knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and controlled substance-related disorders and be knowledgeable of the SAP function as it relates to Employer interest in safety-sensitive functions, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the SAP shall comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
     
H. Leave of Absence Prior to Testing
     1. An employee shall be permitted to take leave of absence in accordance with the FMLA or applicable State leave laws for the purpose of undergoing treatment pursuant to an approved program of alcoholism or drug use. The leave of absence must be requested prior to the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action.
 
     2. Employees requesting to return to work from a voluntary leave of absence for drug use or alcoholism shall be required to submit to testing as provided for in Part J of this Section. Failure to do so will subject the employee to discipline including discharge without the receipt of a prior warning letter.
The provisions of this Section shall not apply to probationary employees.
Consistent with past practice under this Agreement, and notwithstanding any other language in any Supplement, the Employer may take disciplinary action based on the test results as follows:
     1. If the MRO reports that a urine drug test is positive, adulterated, or substituted, the employee shall be subject to discharge except as provided in Part J.
     2. The following actions shall apply in probable suspicion testing based on DOT and contractual mandates.
     a. If the urine drug test is positive, adulterated, or substituted, according to the procedures described in Part G, the employee shall be subject to discharge.
     b. If the breath alcohol test results show a blood alcohol concentration equal to or above the level previously determined by the appropriate Supplemental Agreement for alcohol intoxication, the employee shall be subject to discharge pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement.
     c. If the breath alcohol test is negative and the urine drug test is negative, the employee shall be immediately returned to work and made whole for all lost earnings.
     1. Any employee with a positive, adulterated, or substituted urine drug test result (other than under probable suspicion testing), thereby subjecting the employee to discipline, shall be granted reinstatement on a one (1) time lifetime basis if the employee successfully completes a course of education and/or treatment program as recommended by the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP will recommend a course of education and/or treatment with which the employee must demonstrate successful compliance prior to returning to DOT safety-sensitive duty. The SAP will refer him/her to a treatment program which has been approved by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, where such is the practice. Any cost of evaluation, education and/or treatment over and above that paid for by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, must be borne by the employee.
     2. Employees electing the onetime lifetime evaluation and/or rehabilitation must notify the Company within ten (10) days of being notified by the Company of a positive, adulterated, or substituted urine drug test. The evaluation process and education and/or treatment program must take a minimum of ten (10) days. The employee must begin the evaluation process and education and/or treatment program within fifteen (15) days after notifying the Company. The employee must request reinstatement promptly after successful completion of the education and/or treatment program. After the minimum ten (10) day period and re-evaluation by the SAP, the employee may request reinstatement, but must first provide a negative return to duty urine drug test, to be conducted by a clinic and laboratory of the Employer's choice, before the employee can be reinstated. Any employee choosing to protest the discharge must file a protest under the applicable Supplement. After the discharge is sustained, the employee must notify the Company within ten (10) days of the date of the decision, of the desire to enter the evaluation process and education and/or treatment program.
     3. While undergoing treatment, the employee shall not receive any of the benefits provided by this Agreement or Supplements thereto except the continued accrual of seniority.
     4. Before reinstatement after the minimum ten (10) day period, the employee must be re-evaluated by the Substance Abuse Professional to determine successful compliance with any recommended education and/or treatment program. The employee must then submit to the Employer's return-to-duty urine drug test (and alcohol
 
test if so prescribed by the SAP) with a negative result. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced follow-up urine drug tests in the first year, as determined by the SAP. If, at any time, the employee tests positive, provides an adulterated or substituted specimen, or refuses to submit to a test, the employee shall be subject to discharge.
     (a) Return-to-duty drug test is a urine drug test which an employee must complete with a negative result, after having been reevaluated by a SAP to determine successful compliance with recommended education and/or treatment.
     (b) Follow-up drug testing shall mean those unannounced urine drug tests required (minimum of six (6) in a twelve (12) month period) when an employee tests positive, provides an adulterated or substituted specimen, or refused to be tested and has been evaluated by the SAP, completed education and/or treatment, been re-evaluated by SAP and returned to work. The requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee through breaks in service (i.e. layoff, on-the-job injury, personal illness/injury, leave of absence, etc.). In addition, the requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee to subsequent employers. The SAP has the authority to order any number of follow-up urine drug and/or alcohol tests and to extend the twelve (12) month period up to sixty (60) months.
     1. The parties shall together create a Special Region Joint Area Committee consisting of an equal number of employer and union representatives to hear drug-related discipline disputes. All such disputes arising after the establishment of the Special Region Joint Area Committee shall be taken up between the Employer and Local Union involved. Failing adjustment by these parties, the dispute shall be heard by the Special Region Joint Area Committee within ninety (90) days of the Committee's receipt of the dispute. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee, by majority vote, settles a dispute, such decision shall be final and binding on both parties with no further appeal. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee is unable to agree on or come to a decision on a dispute, the dispute will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
     2. The procedures set forth herein may be invoked only by the authorized Union Representative or the Employer.
     1. Training
Employees undergoing substance abuse training as required by the DOT will be paid for such time and the training will be scheduled in connection with the employee's normal work shift, where possible.
     2. Testing
Employees subject to testing and selected by the random selection process for urine drug testing shall be compensated at the regular straight time hourly rate of pay in the following manner provided that the test is negative:
     a. Random Drug Tests
     (1) for all time at the collection site.
     (2) (a) for travel time one way if the collection site is reasonably en route between the employee's home and the terminal, and the employee is going to or from work; or
     (b) for travel time both ways between the terminal and the collection site, only if the collection site is not reasonably en route between the employee's home and the terminal.
     (3) When an employee is on the clock and a random drug test is taken any time during the employee's shift, and the shift ends after eight (8) hours, the employee is paid time and one-half for all time past the eight (8) hours.
     (4) The Employer will not require the city employee to go for urine drug testing before the city employee's shift, provided the collection site is open during or immediately following the employee's shift.
     (5) During an employee's shift, an employee will not be required to use his/her personal vehicle from the terminal to and from the collection site to take a random drug test.
 
     (6) If a road driver is called at home to take a random drug test at a time when the road driver is not en route to or from work, the driver shall be paid, in addition to all time at the collection site, travel time both ways between the driver's home and the collection site with no minimum guarantee.
     b. Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
     (1) In the event of a non-suspicion-based post-accident testing situation, where the employee has advised the Employer of the issuance of a citation for a moving violation, but the Employer does not direct the employee to be tested immediately, but sends the employee for testing at some later time [during the thirty-two (32) hour period], the employee shall be paid for all time involved in testing, from the time the employee leaves home until the employee returns home after the test.
     (2) When the Employer takes a road driver out of service and directs the employee to be tested immediately, the Employer will make arrangements for the road driver to return to his/her home terminal in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement.
Section 4. Alcohol Testing
The parties agree that in the event of further federal legislation or DOT regulations providing for revised methodologies or requirements, those revisions shall, to the extent they impact this Agreement, unless mandated, be subject to mutual agreement by the parties.
     
A. Employees Who Must be Tested
There shall be random, non suspicion-based post accident and probable suspicion alcohol testing of all employees subject to DOT-mandated alcohol testing. This includes all employees who, as a condition of their employment, are required to have a DOT physical, a CDL and are subject to testing for drugs under Article 35, Section 3B.
Employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement who are not subject to DOT-mandated alcohol testing are only subject to probable suspicion testing as provided in Article 35, Section 3 of the NMFA or the appropriate article of the applicable Supplemental Agreement. The alcohol breath testing methodology outlined in this Section will be utilized for all employees required to undergo probable suspicion testing. (For test results and discipline, refer to NMFA, Article 35, Section 3 I 2.)
     
B. Alcohol Testing Procedure
All alcohol testing under this Section will be conducted in accordance with applicable DOT/FMCSA regulations. All equipment used for alcohol testing must be on the NHTSA Conforming Products List and be used and maintained in compliance with DOT requirements. Breath samples will be collected by a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) who has successfully completed the necessary training course that is the equivalent of the DOT model course and who is knowledgeable of the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40 and any current DOT Guidance. Law enforcement officers who have been certified by state or local governments to conduct breath alcohol testing are deemed to be qualified as Breath Alcohol Technicians. The training shall be specific to the type of Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device being used for testing. The Employer shall provide the employees with material containing the information required by Section 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
     1. Screening Test
The initial screening test uses an Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device, unless other testing methodologies or devices are mandated or agreed upon, to determine levels of alcohol. The following initial cutoff levels shall be used when screening breath samples to determine whether they are negative or positive for alcohol.
     Breath Alcohol Levels:
     Less than 0.02% BAC  Negative
     0.02% BAC and above  Positive (Requires Confirmation Test)
 
     2. Confirmatory Test
All samples identified as positive on the initial screening test, indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02% BAC or higher, shall be confirmed using an EBT device that is capable of providing a printed result in triplicate; is capable of assigning a unique number to each test; and is capable of printing out, on each copy of the printed test result, the manufacturer's name for the device, the device's serial number and the time of the test unless other testing methodologies or devices are mandated or mutually agreed upon.
A confirmation test must be performed a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes after the screening test, but not more than thirty (30) minutes, unless otherwise provided by conditions set forth and defined in 49 CFR Part 40.
The following cutoff levels shall be used to confirm a positive test for alcohol:
     Breath Alcohol Levels:
     Less than 0.02% BAC  Negative
     0.02% BAC to 0.039% BAC  Positive*
     0.04% BAC and above  Positive*
 
     
C. Notification
All employees subject to DOT-mandated random alcohol testing will be notified of testing by the Employer, in person or by direct phone contact.
     
D. Pre-Qualification Testing for Non-DOT Personnel
Section has been deleted
     
E. Random Testing
The method used to randomly select employees for alcohol testing shall be neutral, scientifically valid and in compliance with DOT regulations.
The annual random testing rate for alcohol use shall be the rate established by the Administrator of the FMCSA.
In the event of a grievance or litigation, the Employer shall, upon written request from the employee, release to the employee and the Union (in its capacity as representative of the grievant and as a decision maker in the grievance process), information required to be maintained under the DOT alcohol testing regulations and arising from the results of an alcohol test which is subject to release under the regulations.
The parties agree that no effort will be made to cause the system and method of selection to be anything but a true random selection procedure ensuring that all affected employees are treated fairly and equally.
Employees subject to random alcohol testing shall be tested within one (1) hour prior to starting the tour of duty, during the tour of duty, or immediately after completing the tour of duty.
Employees who are on long-term illness or injury leave of absence, disability or vacation shall not be subject to testing during the period of time they are away from work.
     
F. Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
Employees subject to non suspicion-based post accident alcohol testing shall be limited to those employees subject to DOT alcohol testing, who are involved in an accident where there is:
     (i) a fatality, or;
 
     (ii) a citation under State or local law is issued to the driver for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident in which
     (a) bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or
     (b) one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requires the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
Alcohol testing will be required under the above conditions and employees are required to submit to such testing as soon as practicable. Under no circumstances shall this type of testing be conducted after eight (8) hours from the time of the accident.
It shall be the responsibility of the driver to remain readily available for testing after the occurrence of a commercial motor vehicle accident. It is also the responsibility of the employee to not use alcohol for eight (8) hours or until a DOT post-accident alcohol test is performed, whichever occurs first. It is not the intention of this language to require the delay of necessary medical attention or to prohibit the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or necessary medical attention.
Prior to the effective date of the DOT alcohol testing regulations, the Employer agrees to give each employee subject to DOT non-suspicion-based post-accident testing written notification of the procedures required by the DOT regulations in the event of an accident as defined by the DOT.
     
G. Substance Abuse Professional (SAP)
     1. The Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), as provided in the regulations, means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional, or a drug and alcohol counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol & Other Drug Abuse). All must have knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and controlled substance-related disorders, be knowledgeable of the SAP function as it relates to Employer interest in safety-sensitive functions, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the SAP shall comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
     2. The Employer will provide the employee with a list of resources available to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems with the misuse of alcohol as soon as practicable but no later than thirty-six (36) hours after the Employer's receipt of notice from the BAT that the employee has a BAC of 0.04% or higher, exclusive of holidays and weekends. The SAP will be responsible for recommending the appropriate course of education and/or treatment required prior to the employee returning to work and is the only person responsible for determining, during the evaluation process, whether an employee will be directed to a rehabilitation program, and if so, for how long.
     3. Follow-up and return-to-duty tests need not be confined to the substance involved in the violation. If the SAP determines that a driver needs assistance with an alcohol and drug abuse problem, the SAP may require drug tests to be performed along with any required alcohol follow-up and/or return-to-duty tests, if it has been determined that a driver has violated the drug testing prohibition.
     4. Any cost of evaluation by the SAP and/or rehabilitation recommended by the SAP associated with the abuse of alcohol while performing or available to perform safety-sensitive functions under this Agreement, over and above that paid for by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, must be borne by the employee. The Employer will pay for random, non-suspicion-based post accident and probable suspicion alcohol testing. Return-to-duty and follow-up alcohol testing that is prescribed by the SAP, will be paid for by the Employer, provided the employee tests negative.
     
H. Probable Suspicion Testing
Employees subject to DOT probable suspicion alcohol testing under this Section shall be tested in accordance with current, applicable DOT regulations.
 
For all purposes herein, the parties agree that the terms "probable suspicion" and "reasonable cause" shall be synonymous.
Probable suspicion is defined as an employee's specific observable appearance, behavior, speech or body odor that clearly indicates the need for probable suspicion alcohol testing.
In the event the Employer is unable to determine whether the abnormal behavior or appearance is due to alcohol or drugs, the Employer shall specify that the basis for any disciplinary action or testing is for alcohol and/or drug intoxication. In such cases, the employee shall be tested in accordance with Article 35, Section 3 A, and applicable DOT alcohol testing regulations.
In cases where an employee has specific, observable, abnormal indicators regarding appearance, behavior, speech or body odor, and at least one (1) supervisor, two (2) if available, have probable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of alcohol, the Employer may require the employee, in the presence of a union shop steward or other employee requested by the employee under observation, to submit to a breath alcohol test. Suspicion is not probable and thus not a basis for testing if it is based solely on third party observation and reports.
The supervisor(s) must make a written statement of these observations within twenty-four (24) hours. Upon request, a copy must be provided to the shop steward or other union official after the employee is discharged or suspended or taken out of service.
All supervisors and Employer representatives designated to determine whether probable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo alcohol testing shall receive specific training on the physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of how to detect probable suspicion alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances as required by DOT regulations.
In the event the Employer requires a probable suspicion test, the Employer shall provide transportation to and from the testing location.
     
I. Preparation for Testing
All alcohol testing shall be conducted in conformity with the DOT alcohol regulations. Any alleged abuse by the Employer, such as proven harassment of any employee or deliberate violation of the regulations or the contract shall be subject to the grievance procedure to provide a reasonable remedy for the alleged violation.
Upon arrival at the testing site, an employee must provide the Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) with proper identification. The employee shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under the law.
A standard DOT approved alcohol testing form will be used by all testing facilities. In the case of probable suspicion or other contractually required testing, a Non-DOT chain of custody form will be used for the testing of Non-DOT employees.
     
J. Specimen Testing Procedures
All procedures for alcohol testing will comply with Department of Transportation regulations.
No unauthorized personnel will be allowed in any area of the testing site. Only one alcohol testing procedure will be conducted by a BAT at the same time.
The employee will provide his or her breath sample in a location that allows for privacy. The Employer agrees to recognize all employees' rights to privacy while being subjected to the testing process at all times and at all testing sites. Further, the Employer agrees that in all circumstances the employee's dignity will be considered and all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the entire process does nothing to demean, embarrass or offend the employee unnecessarily. Testing will be under the direct observation of a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT). All procedures shall be conducted in a professional, discreet and objective manner. Direct observation will be necessary in all cases.
The employee shall provide an adequate amount of breath for the Evidential Breath Testing device. If the individual
 
is unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath, the BAT shall direct the individual to again attempt to provide a complete sample.
If an employee is unsuccessful in providing the requisite amount of breath, the Employer then must have the employee obtain, within five (5) days, an evaluation from a licensed physician selected by the Employer and the Local Union and who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee's inability to provide an adequate amount of breath. If the physician is unable to determine that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing an adequate amount of breath, the employee's failure to provide an adequate amount of breath will be regarded as a refusal to take the test and subject the employee to discharge.
     
K. Leave of Absence Prior to Testing
An employee shall be permitted to take leave of absence in accordance with the FMLA or applicable State leave laws for the purpose of undergoing treatment pursuant to an approved program of alcoholism or drug use. The leave of absence must be requested prior to the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action. This provision does not alter or amend the disciplinary provision (Article 35, Section 4 L) of this Section.
Before returning to work from a voluntary leave of absence, the employee must have completed any recommended treatment and taken a return to duty test, with a result of less than 0.02% BAC, and further be subject to six (6) unannounced follow-up alcohol tests in the first twelve (12) months following the employee's return to duty.
The Supplemental Agreements shall address the issue of an extra-board driver who, while at his home terminal, has consumed alcohol, is then called for dispatch and requests additional time off. Requesting time off under this provision shall not be used as a subterfuge to avoid taking a random alcohol (and/or drug) test.
     
L. Disciplinary Action Based on Positive Test Results
     1. First Positive Test
0.02% BAC-0.039% BAC
Out of Service for 24 hours

Second Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Positive  Test 0.02% BAC and higher  subject to discharge.
     6. An employee's refusal to submit to any alcohol test will subject the employee to discharge.
     
M. Return to Duty After a Positive (Greater than .04 to the State Limit) Alcohol Test
Before returning to work the employee must be evaluated by a SAP, comply with any education and/or treatment recommended by the SAP, be re-evaluated by the SAP to determine compliance with recommended education and/or treatment, and take a return-to-duty alcohol test, showing a result of less than 0.02% BAC. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug tests as determined by the SAP. The requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee through breaks in service (i.e. layoff, on-the-job injury, personal illness/injury, leave of absence, etc.). In addition, the requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee to subsequent employers. The SAP has the authority to order any number of follow-up alcohol and/or urine drug tests and to extend the twelve (12) month period up to sixty (60) months.
     
N. Paid-for-time-Testing
Employees subject to testing and selected by the random selection process for alcohol testing shall be compensated at the regular straight time hourly rate of pay provided that the test is negative:
     1. Random Alcohol Tests
     a. Paid for all time at the collection site.
     b. (1) for travel time one way if the collection site is reasonably en route between the employee's home and the terminal, and the employee is going to or from work; or
     (2) for travel time both ways between the terminal and the collection site, only if the collection site is not reasonably en route between the employee's home and the terminal.
     c. When an employee is on the clock and a random alcohol test is taken any time during the employee's shift, and the shift ends after eight (8) hours, the employee is paid time and one-half for all time past the eight (8) hours.
     d. The Employer will not require the city employee to go for alcohol testing before the city employee's shift, provided the collection site is open during or immediately following the employee's shift.
     e. During an employee's shift, an employee will not be required to use his/her personal vehicle from the terminal to and from the collection site to take a random alcohol test.
     f. If a road driver is called to take a random alcohol test at a time when the road driver is not en route to or
 
from work, the driver shall be paid, in addition to all time at the collection site, travel time both ways between the location of the driver when called and the collection site with no minimum guarantee.
     2. Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
     a. In the event of a non-suspicion-based post-accident testing situation, where the employee has advised the Employer of the issuance of a citation for a moving violation, but the Employer does not direct the employee to be tested immediately, but sends the employee for testing at some later time (during the eight (8) hour period), the employee shall be paid for all time involved in testing, from the time the employee leaves home until the employee returns home after the test.
     b. When the Employer takes a driver out of service and directs the employee to be tested immediately, the Employer will make arrangements for the driver to return to his/her home terminal in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement.
          
O. Record Retention
The Employer shall maintain records in a secure manner so that disclosure of information to unauthorized persons does not occur.
Each Employer or its agent is required to maintain the following records for two years:
     1. Records of the inspection and maintenance of each EBT used in employee testing;
     2. Documentation of the Employer's compliance with the Quality Assurance Program for each EBT it uses for alcohol testing; and
     3. Records of the training and proficiency testing of each BAT used in employee testing.
     The Employer must maintain for five years records pertaining to the calibration of each EBT used in alcohol testing, including records of the results of external calibration checks.
     
P. Special Grievance Procedure
     1. The parties shall together create a Special Region Joint Area Committee consisting of an equal number of Employer and Union representatives to hear drug and alcohol related discipline disputes. All such disputes arising after the establishment of the Special Region Joint Area Committee shall be taken up between the Employer and Local Union involved. Failing adjustment by these parties, the dispute shall be heard by the Special Region Joint Area Committee within ninety (90) days of the Committee's receipt of the dispute. When the Special Region Joint Area Committee, by majority vote, settles a dispute, such decision shall be final and binding on both parties with no further appeal. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee is unable to agree or come to a decision on a dispute, the dispute will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
     2. The Procedures set forth herein may be invoked only by the authorized Union representative or the Employer.

This Article also covers employees with a qualified disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, although whether the Employer has complied with the ADA's statutory requirements shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 1. Sick Leave
Effective April 1, 1980 and thereafter, all Supplemental Agreements shall provide for five (5) days of sick leave per contract year.
Sick leave not used by March 31 of any contract year will be paid on March 31 at the applicable hourly rate in existence on that date. Each day of sick leave will be paid for on the basis of eight (8) hours' straight-time pay at the applicable hourly rate.
Sick leave will be paid to eligible employees beginning on the third (3rd) working day of absence due to sickness or accident except where the employee is hospitalized prior to that date when it will be paid beginning on the date of hospitalization.
Effective January 1, 2009, the accrual and cash out dates for sick leave will become April 1, to January 1. As an example, employees will be entitled to cash out accrued unused sick leave on April 1, 2008, and will accrue an additional 5 days sick leave between April 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, and will be entitled to cash out any unused sick leave on January 1, 2009. In addition, no employee will lose their entitlement to the cash out of unused sick leave on January 1, 2009, because they were not able to satisfy the present eligibility provision of having received 90 days of compensation during the shorten qualifying period of April 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008.
The additional sick leave days referred to above shall also be included in those Supplements containing sick leave provisions prior to April 1, 1976. The National Negotiating Committees may develop rules and regulations to apply to sick leave provisions negotiated in the 1976 Agreement and amended in this Agreement uniformly to the Supplements. The Committee shall not establish rules and regulations for sick leave programs in existence on March 31, 1976.
Section 2. Jury Duty
Effective April 1, 2003, all regular employees called for jury duty will receive the difference between eight (8) hours
 
pay at the applicable hourly wage and actual payment received for jury service for each day of jury duty to a maximum of fifteen (15) days pay for each contract year.
When such employees report for jury service on a scheduled workday, they will not unreasonably be required to report for work that particular day.
Time spent on jury service will be considered time worked for purposes of Employer contributions to health & welfare and pension plans, vacation eligibility and payment, holidays and seniority, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Supplemental Agreements to a maximum of fifteen (15) days for each contract year.
Employees who have been selected to serve on a jury, including those selected as an alternate jury member and who are scheduled to work shifts beginning after 4:00 p.m. will be given the option of working either the day their jury duty begins or the day following the day their jury duty begins and thereafter shall not be required to work on any day in which the jury is in session.
Section 3. Family and Medical Leave Act
All employees who worked for the Employer for a minimum of twelve (12) months and worked at least 1250 hours during the past twelve (12) months are eligible for unpaid leave as set forth in the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
Eligible employees are entitled to up to a total of 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12) month period for the following reasons:
     1. Birth or adoption of a child or the placement of a child for foster care;
     2. To care for a spouse, child or parent of the employee due to a serious health condition;
     3. A serious health condition of the employee.
The employee's seniority rights shall continue as if the employee had not taken leave under this Section, and the Employer will maintain health insurance coverage during the period of the leave.
The Employer may require the employee to substitute accrued paid vacation or other paid leave for part of the twelve (12) week leave period.
The employee is required to provide the Employer with at least thirty (30) days advance notice before FMLA leave begins if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee is required to give notice as soon as practicable. The Employer has the right to require medical certification of a need for leave under this Act. In addition, the Employer has the right to require a second (2nd) opinion at the Employer's expense. If the second opinion conflicts with the initial certification, a third opinion from a health care provider selected by the first and second opinion health care providers, at the Employer's expense may be sought, which shall be final and binding. Failure to provide certification shall cause any leave taken to be treated as an unexcused absence.
As a condition of returning to work, an employee who has taken leave due to his/her own serious health condition must be medically qualified to perform the functions of his/her job. In cases where employees fail to return to work, the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement will apply.
It is specifically understood that an employee will not be required to repay any of the contributions for his/her health insurance during FMLA leave. No employee will be disciplined for requesting or taking FMLA leave under the contract absent fraud, misrepresentation, or dishonesty.
Disputes arising under this provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
The provisions of this Section are in response to the federal FMLA and shall not supersede any state or local law which provides for greater employee rights.
The Employer may not force an employee to use pre-scheduled vacation time as FMLA leave, provided the vacation
 
involved was prescheduled in accordance with the applicable supplemental agreement.
The Employer may not force an employee who has taken separate hours of unpaid leave for medical reasons to substitute those hours as accrued leave under the FMLA.
The Employer may not force an employee to substitute accrued leave for FMLA leave if the employee is receiving supplemental loss-of-time disability benefits from a benefit plan under the Agreement.
Section 1.
This Agreement shall be in full force and effect from April 1, 2008, to and including March 31, 2013, and shall continue from year to year thereafter unless written notice of desire to cancel or terminate this Agreement is served by either party upon the other at least sixty (60) days prior to date of expiration.
When notice of cancellation or termination is given under this Section, the Employer and the Union shall continue to observe all terms of this Agreement until impasse is reached in negotiations, or until either the Employer or the Union exercise their rights under Section 3 of this Article.
Section 2.
Where no such cancellation or termination notice is served and the parties desire to continue said Agreement but also desire to negotiate changes or revisions in this Agreement, either party may serve upon the other a notice at least sixty (60) days prior to March 31, 2013 or March 31st of any subsequent contract year, advising that such party desires to revise or change terms or conditions of such Agreement.
Section 3.
The Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, as representative of the Local Unions or the signatory Employer or the authorizing Employer Associations, shall each have the right to unilaterally determine when to engage in economic recourse (strike or lockout) on or after April 1, 2013, unless agreed to the contrary.
Section 4.
Revisions agreed upon or ordered shall be effective as of April 1, 2008 or April 1st of any subsequent contract year.
Section 5.
In the event of an inadvertent failure by either party to give the notice set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, such party may give such notice at any time prior to the termination or automatic renewal date of this Agreement. If a notice is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the expiration date of this Agreement shall be the sixty-first (61st) day following such notice.
Section 6.
In those circumstances where the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, as representative of the Local Union, or the signatory Employer or the authorizing Employer Associations, shall have served a notice of reopening pursuant to this Article and have not been able to arrive at an agreement within six (6) months, then either side shall have the right on sixty (60) days' written notice to terminate this Agreement.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On April 23, 2008, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2008 results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 23, 2008)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a 78% increase in first quarter 2008 net income of $8.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2007. Arkansas Best's 2008 first quarter revenue grew to $447.5 million from $427.8 million in the first quarter of last year.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had first quarter 2008 revenue of $427.7 million, a per-day increase of 4.5% compared to first quarter 2007 revenue of $412.6 million. Operating income in this year's first quarter was $12.9 million compared to $5.8 million during the first quarter of 2007. ABF's first quarter 2008 operating ratio improved to 97.0% from 98.6% during the first quarter of 2007. "During the first three months of this year, ABF displayed solid execution and provided excellent service to our customers in the midst of what continues to be a difficult freight environment," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.
     ABF's first quarter 2008 total weight per day was flat compared to the first quarter of 2007. "Though business levels remain depressed, quarterly year-over-year tonnage trends have continued to improve since the third quarter of 2007," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF continues to benefit from additional shipments moving in regional freight lanes."
     "Focus on cost control, while matching labor expense with available business levels, helped ABF's performance in the first quarter," said Mr. Davidson. "I am pleased to note that the ABF team improved shipment and weight per hour productivity measures while also increasing the level of service and cargo care to our customers."
 
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight in this year's first quarter was $26.32, an increase of 4.8% over last year's first quarter figure of $25.11. "As was the case in the fourth quarter, the overall increase in revenue yield was affected by higher fuel surcharge resulting from considerably higher fuel-related costs and by profile shifts in our freight mix," said Mr. Davidson. "Because of the weak freight environment, pricing in our industry remains very competitive. However, our account profitability continues to be supported by the high level of value-added service that we provide."
     "In 2007, ABF reduced transit times, creating thousands of new next-day lanes, and that investment is beginning to bear fruit. Throughout this year, further operational changes facilitated by ABF's new labor contract should result in additional transit-time reductions in thousands of new regional freight lanes and in some of ABF's traditional longer markets," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF also expects to offer enhanced regional service throughout the western one-third of the United States by the end of the year."
     "During a period of economic decline and business slowdown, shippers tend to seek out competent, stable motor carriers who offer consistent, damage-free transit and reliable customer service. ABF has been benefiting from this flight to quality' industry trend," said Mr. Davidson. In this year's first quarter, ABF's continuing emphasis on its Quality Process provided improvements throughout the company, including:
 
     "During challenging economic times, these are a few of the characteristics that distinguish ABF as a stable and reliable choice in the LTL marketplace," said Mr. Davidson. "In addition, our financial strength offers a foundation for managing through the current environment and for considering future opportunities to serve customers that provide acceptable returns. We are evaluating opportunities inside and outside of ABF to use our considerable resources to increase shareholder value."
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2008 first quarter results. The call will be today, Wednesday, April 23, at 12:00 Noon ET (11:00 a.m. CT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257 or (706) 634-6529 (for international callers).

Prior to any event in connection with the Award that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign minimum statutory tax withholding obligation (i.e. federal, state, OASDI and HI and/or local) (the ""), Participant is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. Participant and the Company agree that tax withholding required as a result of cash dividend equivalents and/or periodic vesting will be handled at the Company's option by payroll deduction.
Payment of Withholding Taxes
Tax Withholding Obligation
          (i) . Unless Participant elects to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by an alternative means in accordance with Paragraph 7(b)(ii), that
By Withholding Shares
 
occurs at the Settlement Date, Participant's acceptance of this Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company to withhold on Participant's behalf the number of Shares from those Shares issuable to Participant as a result of the occurrence of a Settlement Date as the Company determines to be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
          (ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arising as a result of the Settlement Date, Participant may notify the Company of Participant's election to pay Participant's Tax Withholding Obligation by wire transfer, cashier's check or other means permitted by the Company. In such case, Participant shall satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation by paying to the Company on such date as it shall specify an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the expected Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a cashier's check payable to the Company, Attn: Executive Benefits, at the address set forth in Paragraph 15(a), or such other address as the Company may from time to time direct, or (iii) such other means as the Company may establish or permit. Participant agrees and acknowledges that prior to the date the Tax Withholding Obligation arises, the Company will be required to estimate the amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation and accordingly may require the amount paid to the Company under this Paragraph 7(b)(ii) to be more than the minimum amount that may actually be due and that, if Participant has not delivered payment of a sufficient amount to the Company to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation (regardless of whether as a result of the Company underestimating the required payment or Participant failing to timely make the required payment), the additional Tax Withholding Obligation amounts shall be satisfied in the manner specified in Paragraph 7(b)(i). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Tax Withholding Obligation that arises on a date other than a Settlement Date may only be satisfied pursuant to this Paragraph 7(b)(ii).
By Other Payment
8. Excess Parachute Payments
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments in respect of this Award, together with any other payments to which Participant has the right to receive from the Company or any purchaser, successor, or assign, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G), the payments pursuant to the Award and/or such other plans or agreements shall be reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, with any such reduction first applied to payments pursuant to any Deferred Salary Agreement to which Participant is a party and then to payments pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan.
9. Plan Controls
     The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, as it exists on the Grant Date and as the Plan is amended from time to time.

13. Suspension or Termination of Award
     Pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, if at any time prior to Participant's receipt of Shares pursuant to the Award an Authorized Officer reasonably believes that Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct (as defined below), the Authorized Officer, the Committee or the Board may suspend Participant's rights to vest in any Restricted Stock Units, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of Vested Units pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed.

The arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the Committee and Participant. If the Committee and Participant are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected by the American Arbitration Association.

     (l) .

ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 24, 2008)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced that Wesley B. Kemp will become President and Chief Operating Officer of its largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System Inc., effective August 1, 2008. Mr. Kemp will assume the duties from Robert A. Davidson, who will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer of Arkansas Best and as Chief Executive Officer of ABF.
     Mr. Kemp, who is 62 years old, has held a variety of positions during his 39-year career with ABF and currently serves as Senior Vice President of Operations, with responsibility for all areas of operational execution. He joined ABF as a management trainee in 1969 after graduating from the University of Arkansas with a bachelor's degree in management. From 1985 until 2006, Mr. Kemp was ABF's Vice President of Terminal Operations following his service as an ABF Regional Vice President of Operations based in Bristol, CT. Mr. Kemp has completed the Executive Program at Northwestern University in Advanced Transportation/Logistics Management. He currently serves on the boards of the Mack-Blackwell Transportation Center and the Supply Chain Management Research Center at the University of Arkansas.
     "Wes Kemp has been an important contributor to the growth and development of our company for nearly forty years," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "He has a firm understanding of the people-centered culture, customer focus, and active ethics that have made ABF so successful. Beginning in the early-eighties, Wes was one of the first proponents of ABF's Quality Process. Throughout the years, Wes has been a consistent advocate of the quality principles of doing things right the first time and working to identify and correct the root causes of errors in order to benefit our customers and our company. Wes has been a well-respected leader and mentor to many of ABF's best-in-class employees."
     "In addition, Wes has been an innovator and pioneer who is always open to exploring new technologies and opportunities for serving ABF's customers in a cost effective manner," said Mr. Davidson. "He has overseen the adaptation and implementation of technology to customize ABF's processes to the specific needs of our customers while providing unprecedented visibility and control throughout the supply chain. Recently, Wes and his operations team have been the architects of ABF's regional freight initiative that will result in a radical reduction of transit times in over 30,000 station-to-
 
station lanes. This will allow ABF to effectively compete and grow in the important regional transportation market while enhancing our best-in-class longhaul network."
     "Arkansas Best Corporation is currently involved in a strategic review of available opportunities for future growth and potential diversification into other businesses in transportation, distribution and logistics. Our corporate officers are actively considering a broad array of options to best leverage our core competencies, financial stability, and strong balance sheet," said Mr. Davidson.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 22, 2008, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2008 results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated October 22, 2008.
99.1
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 22, 2008)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2008 net income of $15.4 million, or $0.61 per diluted common share, compared to third quarter 2007 net income of $18.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share. Arkansas Best's third quarter 2008 revenue was $495.8 million, compared to third quarter 2007 revenue of $486.0 million. "During a volatile and uncertain period in domestic and worldwide financial markets, Arkansas Best Corporation remains a stable, progressive company in a strong financial position," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.
ABF Freight System, Inc.
     ABF Freight System, Inc., the company's largest subsidiary, had third quarter 2008 revenue of $476.3 million, essentially the same, on a per-day basis, as revenue in the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter 2008 operating income at ABF was $25.2 million compared to $28.5 million during the third quarter of 2007. ABF's third quarter 2008 operating ratio was 94.7% versus an operating ratio of 93.9% in the third quarter of 2007. "The increase in ABF's third quarter operating ratio reflected the effects of a deteriorating freight environment," said Mr. Davidson. "However, ABF's traditional focus on controlling costs and providing increased value to its customers helped reduce the margin erosion that would be expected during a period of economic decline," said Mr. Davidson.
     "Compared to unusually high costs in the third quarter of last year, workers' compensation claims experience had a favorable impact of 120 basis points on ABF's third quarter 2008 operating ratio," said Mr. Davidson. "On a year-to-date basis, workers' compensation costs continue to be well below ABF's ten-year historical average and had a favorable impact of 60 basis points on the operating ratio so far this year."
     ABF's third quarter 2008 total weight per day decreased by 5.1% versus last year. "In the first half of the year, ABF's freight tonnage seemed to stabilize compared to 2007. However, during this year's third quarter, tonnage levels decelerated for each month of the quarter as the freight environment weakened further," said Mr. Davidson.
 
     Near the end of the third quarter, ABF announced additional service improvements in its Regional Performance Model (RPM) that further reduced transit times in over 24,000 lanes.  Since the inception of its regional initiative, ABF has improved service in over 33,000 station-to-station lanes representing more than 40% of its North American network.  These service enhancements allow ABF to provide comprehensive and reliable service within the next-day and second-day LTL market.  "This dramatic expansion of our regional service, coupled with ABF's best-in-class long-haul capabilities, allows one carrier to provide full North American coverage with the cargo care, web visibility, competitive costs, reliable transit times and personal attention that customers require to support their own businesses," said Mr. Davidson.   
     Total billed revenue per hundredweight was $27.75, an increase of 5.8% over last year's third quarter figure of $26.22. "Though fuel-related costs and the associated fuel surcharge steadily declined throughout the quarter, fuel surcharge levels were still higher than those in the same period last year," said Mr. Davidson. "As we've seen in recent quarters, revenue per hundredweight comparisons were affected by changes in ABF's freight mix and shipment profile. For instance, during the third quarter, length of haul decreased by 3.1% due to handling a higher percentage of regional shipments. ABF's total average weight per shipment increased as well. Both of these factors reduce the year-over-year revenue per hundredweight comparison." ABF's average increase on contract and deferred pricing agreements finalized during the third quarter was 2.4%.
     In a number of ways, Arkansas Best and ABF represent stability in today's challenging economic environment:
 
     "The current freight environment has now lasted for over two years. In addition, the rapid changes that have recently occurred in the credit markets appear to be the most dramatic our country has experienced in over seventy years. During a period of economic decline and financial upheaval, shippers and investors seek companies with financial strength, prudent management, operational stability and a sharp focus on increasing value in the marketplace," said Mr. Davidson. "In the past, I've spoken about a flight to quality.' During times like these, that idea has never been more true."
Conference Call
     Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2008 third quarter results. The call will be today, Wednesday, October 22, at 12:00 Noon ET (11:00 a.m. CT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (877) 275-1257 or (706) 634-6529 (for international callers).

Note: Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 include reclassifications of $6.2 million and $16.9 million, respectively, associated with certain shipments involving third-party interline carriers and certain brokerage transactions where ABF retains the primary obligation to provide services to the customer. This revenue is now recorded on a gross basis, with expenses paid to the third-party carrier recorded in the "purchased transportation" category. Previously, this revenue was reported on a net basis whereby the expense of the third-party carrier was netted against revenue. The change had no impact on ABF's operating income and a minimal impact on ABF's operating ratio.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On January 29, 2009, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
          (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 29, 2009)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a fourth quarter 2008 net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to net income of $13.5 million, or $0.54 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.
          "Arkansas Best's fourth quarter results reflect the profitability effects of ABF's decelerating tonnage levels and competitive pricing pressures in the midst of a freight environment of unprecedented weakness," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "ABF's fourth quarter and full-year results also reflect our continuing commitment to maintaining customer service levels, including the strategically-important regional initiative."
          "We are now over twenty-seven months into a freight recession that is the worst I have seen during my 37 years in this industry," said Mr. Davidson. "Fourth quarter freight declines of this magnitude, in addition to those ABF has experienced during the previous two years, have made it more and more difficult to adequately reduce network costs in step with business declines without impacting the service to our customers. The resulting negative operating leverage has adversely influenced profitability," said Mr. Davidson.
          "Our current results are obviously unacceptable. Since the fourth quarter of 2006, when ABF first experienced dramatic declines in business, we have been committed to taking the necessary actions to directly respond to the on-going decline in business," said Mr. Davidson. "Since that time we have taken the following steps to reduce ABF's network capacity and cost structure. Some of these actions took place in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in January 2009. These recent changes will have a greater impact in reducing costs beginning in 2009,":
 
          "Our strong financial position, with ample cash reserves and very little debt, affords us the ability to continue a high level of service to our customers despite lower tonnage and declining prices. In addition, we remain able to take advantage of the unique opportunities that present themselves in this environment," said Mr. Davidson. "Meanwhile, we will continue to respond in a prudent and resolute manner to the challenges in our industry by making the necessary changes to our cost structure."

          "Though there has been little positive economic news in our industry recently, it is important to mention some of the achievements of 2008 that continue to set ABF apart in the LTL marketplace," said Mr. Davidson. "ABF's cargo claim ratio reflected further improvement; ABF's accident per mile ratio improved; ABF's combined costs for workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims were below historical averages; ABF was once again named as one of the top U.S. companies to sell for by magazine and ABF was once again cited as an innovator in information technology by magazine. These things matter to customers and they will continue to differentiate ABF in a hyper-competitive environment. Our

deep roots of corporate excellence, our industry-leading employee team, and our strong financial position will allow us to remain one of the leading carriers in the LTL industry," said Mr. Davidson.
Strategic Alternatives
          Arkansas Best recently engaged an advisory firm to help develop a formal strategic plan and to assist in the identification of potential acquisition opportunities. In the fourth quarter of 2008, charges associated with this initiative were approximately $0.8 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per share, net of taxes. Additional expenses associated with this review will occur over the next three to four months. "Although ABF and the freight industry are in the midst of a significant decline, we believe this timely process is very important in determining a future path that maximizes shareholder value," said Mr. Davidson.
Nonunion Pension Plan Contribution
          The decline in the overall equity markets during 2008 impacted the funded status of Arkansas Best's nonunion pension plan. In December 2008, the company made a voluntary tax-deductible contribution to this plan of $20 million. At the end of 2008, the plan was 83% funded on an accumulated benefit obligation basis. An additional first quarter 2009 tax-deductible contribution of up to $15 million is currently being considered. As a result of the impact of the overall equity markets on Arkansas Best's plan assets and investment returns, the company anticipates that its 2009 pre-tax expense could be approximately twice as much as the 2008 expense of $9.6 million. An update on 2009 pension expense will be provided in the company's first quarter 2009 earnings release.
Capital Expenditures
          Arkansas Best estimates 2009 net capital expenditures will be approximately $45 million to $50 million including road and city equipment replacements totaling approximately $40 million. Total net capital expenditures in 2008 were $42 million. Arkansas Best's depreciation and amortization for 2009 is estimated to be approximately $70 million to $75 million.
Conference Call
          Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2008 fourth quarter and full year results. The call will be today, Thursday, January 29, at 11:00 a.m. ET (10:00 a.m. CT). Interested parties are invited to listen by calling

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change In Fiscal Year.
On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") approved the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Amended Bylaws"), which Amended Bylaws are effective as of April 21, 2009. The principal changes between the Amended Bylaws and the bylaws in effect prior to the approval of the Amended Bylaws (the "Bylaws") are as follows:
Stockholder Advance Notice Provisions
Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws (which replaces former Article II, Section 10) consolidates stockholder proposals and director nominations, for both annual and special meetings of stockholders, into a single section. Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws also includes the advance notice provisions for director nominations and is the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business before a meeting of the Company's stockholders.
Generally, Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws (i) clarifies the application of advance notice provisions to extend to all proposals and nominations for election as directors of the Company, (ii) revises and expands the scope of information that a stockholder needs to provide to the Company in connection with any proposal and (iii) requires the person making a proposal to provide the Company with a completed written questionnaire concerning the director nominee and provide certain representations and information to the Company. Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws requires that a stockholder making a proposal or nominating a director must (i) be a holder of record at the time of giving the required notice and as of the time of the meeting, (ii) be entitled to vote at the meeting and (iii) comply with the other requirements contained in Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws. To be timely, any nomination or any other business to be brought before the annual meeting must be in writing and delivered to the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 100th day prior to the date of such meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company. Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws also includes advance notice requirements regarding any proposals to be presented at any special meeting of stockholders that are similar to the advance notification provisions concerning any annual meetings of stockholders. The adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or special meeting will not commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice.
Section 2.13 of the Amended Bylaws requires that a stockholder making a proposal or nomination provide the Company with certain information, including (i) information about the proposal or the nominee, as applicable, (ii) such stockholder's ownership interest in the Company (including, for example, any derivative instruments directly or indirectly owned beneficially by the stockholder) and other economic interests in the Company's securities and the
 
proposal and (iii) in the case of a stockholder proposal, the reason for conducting such business at the meeting.
Stockholder Meetings
The Amended Bylaws contain new provisions and revise prior provisions to clarify the procedures governing stockholders meetings. Specifically, new Section 2.6 of the Amended Bylaws states that in the event a quorum is not present, a stockholders meeting may be adjourned without notice other than an announcement at such meeting, provided such adjournment is not more than 30 days. Additionally, the Amended Bylaws provides that (i) only stockholders of record will be permitted to present motions at any stockholders meeting and (ii) the Chairman of the Board shall preside over and conduct stockholder meetings, including, among other things, determining the order of business to be conducted, prescribing rules of conduct for the meeting and declaring motions or persons out of order. Section 2.15 of the Amended Bylaws provides stockholders of the Company the right to inspect a list of stockholders and other related records, subject to the requirements of such section and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Declassification of the Board
On April 21, 2009, at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company (the "2009 Stockholders Meeting"), the Company's stockholders approved amendments to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the Board over a three-year period. Specifically, (i) the Company's directors elected to three-year terms at the 2009 annual meeting will continue to serve the remainder of their elected terms, (ii) the Company's directors with terms expiring at the 2010 annual meeting will be elected to one-year terms and (iii) the Company's directors with terms expiring at the 2011 annual meeting will be elected to one-year terms. Beginning with the 2012 annual meeting, and at each annual meeting thereafter, all directors will be elected annually. Section 3.2 of the Amended Bylaws, which addresses the number of members of the Board, has been revised to conform to the amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation adopted at the 2009 Stockholders Meeting.
Officers
The Bylaws' provisions pertaining to the Company's officers (previously Article IV, now Article V) has been revised to, among other things, explicitly state that the Board may remove any of the officers at any time. In addition, the Amended Bylaws revise the description of the powers and duties of several of the officers. The revised description of the office of President provides that the President has the power to appoint and remove subordinate officers and employees, except for officers and employees appointed by the Board.
Indemnification
The Bylaws' provisions pertaining to the Company's indemnification of directors, officers and other employees and agents has been revised to clarify that (i) a director's or officer's right to indemnification and advancement of expenses vests at the time such person becomes a director or officer of the Company and (ii) subsequent amendment of the indemnification provisions may
 
not adversely affect the rights of directors or officers with respect to events or actions occurring prior to the amendment. (See Sections 8.1(k) and (l) of the Amended Bylaws.)
Amendments
In the case of stockholder amendments to the Amended Bylaws, former Article VIII of the Bylaws (Article IX of the Amended Bylaws) was revised to increase the percentage of outstanding shares necessary to amend the Amended Bylaws from 66 2/3% to 75% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such amendment.
Miscellaneous
The Amended Bylaws contain a new Article IV to address in greater detail committees of the Board. The Bylaws were also revised to add provisions regarding procedures at meetings of the Board and to provide that directors are presumed to have assented to actions taken at meetings at which they are present unless certain procedures (such as the director's dissent is noted in the minutes of the meeting) are followed. The Amended Bylaws contain other amendments and revisions, including, among other revisions, those of a more housekeeping nature, such as revisions to remove the address of the Company's registered office in Delaware, updating the address of the Company's headquarters, and providing that stockholder meetings may take place within or without the State of Delaware.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 17, 1992 as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 and is incorporated herein by reference, (ii) the Bylaws, a copy of which was filed with the SEC on October 24, 2007 as Exhibit 3.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, (iii) the Certificate of Amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflecting the amendments approved by the stockholders at the 2009 Annual Meeting, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and (iv) the Amended Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Indemnification
          (a) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
 
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
          (b) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
          (c) To the extent that a present or former director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
          (d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.
 
          (e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this . Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees or agents shall be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Article VIII
          (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
Article VIII
          (g) The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this .
Article VIII
          (h) For purposes of this , references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
Article VIII
Article VIII
          (i) For purposes of this , references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this .
Article VIII
Article VIII
          (j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified,
Article VIII
 
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
          (k) A director's or officer's right to indemnification and advancement of expenses vests at the time such person becomes a director or officer of the corporation or begins serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
          (l) Any repeal or amendment of this shall be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of any such director or officer or the obligations of the corporation with respect to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director or officer prior to any such repeal or amendment of this .

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 22, 2009, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its second quarter results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
          (Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 22, 2009)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a second quarter 2009 net loss of $15.4 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to net income of $16.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008.
          "The effects of lower freight levels and a competitive pricing environment that has intensified since the first quarter were the main challenges faced by our company in the second quarter. In addition, our results were affected by unusual increases in nonunion healthcare and pension, workers' compensation and third-party casualty insurance claims costs versus last year," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, despite the continuation of the severe economic recession that is unlike any we have seen before, we remain focused on cost control, managing yields in a difficult environment and maintaining the high level of overall customer service that will ensure our long-term success."
Arkansas Best Corporation
Second Quarter 2009
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
Second Quarter 2009
          "ABF continues to manage its network resources, especially labor and equipment, to the level of freight moving throughout its network. As needed, additional reductions in system resources and costs have been made in the last few months," said Mr. Davidson. "Though success in our business requires us to efficiently manage costs, we do so carefully in order to preserve our ability to meet specific customer requirements and to offer unique value in the marketplace. Our solid financial position provides the necessary flexibility to take a long-term approach to customer relationships, even in the midst of the current, challenging environment."
          The recessionary economy and lower freight levels have resulted in increased pressure on industry pricing during the second quarter. In every pricing decision, ABF seeks to be reasonably compensated for the high level of service and safe, dependable cargo care it offers. The current economic environment makes that challenging. As it has always done, ABF continues to make pricing decisions on the basis of individual account profitability.
     "We are fortunate to have a solid financial position during this prolonged recessionary period. Our on-going financial strength gives us the foundation to navigate through this difficult time while offering the opportunity to achieve our long-term goals when things finally improve," said Mr. Davidson. "In the meantime, we will strive to weather this storm while serving our customers with a high level of service that distinguishes us throughout the LTL industry
."

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 21, 2009, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its third quarter results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
          (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 21, 2009)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a third quarter 2009 net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
          "Our third quarter results reflect the on-going impact of lower freight levels and competitive industry pricing that deteriorated further compared to the first half of the year," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are now entering the fourth year of a severe freight decline that is unprecedented in our company's history. It is unclear when business levels will benefit from a significant improvement in our nation's economy. In the meantime, our company's emphasis will remain on providing a high level of value-added service to our customers while managing our business, for the long-term, through diligent cost control and disciplined pricing."

Third Quarter 2009
ABF Freight System, Inc.
Third Quarter 2009
 
          "The smaller decline in ABF's third quarter tonnage implies an improving freight environment compared to the first half of the year. However, this year-over-year trend is primarily related to comparisons back to last year's third quarter when business levels fell sharply. Nevertheless, this quarter's tonnage also benefitted from modest market share gains from our LTL competitors," said Mr. Davidson. "On a sequential basis, ABF's third quarter tonnage trends were slightly better than normal, seasonal expectations. Though that trend has weakened somewhat since the last full week of September, we continue to add freight previously handled by other carriers. Regardless of business levels, we continue to manage the costs of the ABF network each day in line with the amount of available freight, while striving to maintain the high level of customized service that is important to ABF's customers."
          "Industry LTL pricing further weakened during the third quarter. Declining yields, worsened by the recessionary economy, have made it more difficult to cover normal cost increases," said Mr. Davidson. "Despite a more price-sensitive environment, ABF has maintained its traditional emphasis on offering each customer a fair, competitive rate. ABF's history of pricing discipline has contributed to our current financial strength, and Arkansas Best's financial stability allows us to maintain high service levels and manage the company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, employees and customers."

          Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2009 third quarter results.

     (Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 21, 2009)  Robert A. Davidson, current President and Chief Executive Officer of Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) has announced his retirement from the company effective on December 31, 2009. Mr. Davidson is also resigning from the Arkansas Best Corporation Board of Directors, effective on December 31, 2009. Judy R.

Young III, Arkansas Best Chairman. "Following the 1980 deregulation of the trucking industry, Bob was the perfect person to establish ABF's new Pricing Department and to develop and implement ABF's account pricing philosophies that have been major contributors to the success and survival of ABF. During his time leading ABF's Marketing initiative, Bob was instrumental in establishing ABF's award-winning position as the most innovative, customer-centric carrier in the LTL industry. ABF's reputation for providing a high level of service and significant value in the marketplace is built on the foundation that Bob Davidson has helped establish over the years. We will miss his leadership and guidance and regret his decision to take an early retirement. His service to our company is greatly appreciated," said Mr. Young.

     "As a result of her nearly twenty years of service to the transportation industry, Judy McReynolds is highly qualified to guide Arkansas Best Corporation. I am pleased to know that our employees, customers and shareholders will be benefitting from her vision and judgment," said Robert A. Davidson, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "During her time at our company, Judy has displayed a combination of intelligence, integrity and energy. She exhibits the steady leadership that was established by our founder, Robert A. Young Jr. and that continues today through our Chairman, Robert A. Young III. In her role as Chief Financial Officer, Judy has worked closely with me in developing the strategic initiatives that will allow Arkansas Best to grow and prosper for many years to come. We all can look forward to a bright future for our company under her leadership."

ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On December 30, 2009, certain subsidiaries of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") entered into definitive agreements to establish an accounts receivable securitization program. The agreements include a Receivables Loan Agreement with SunTrust Bank ("SunTrust") which provides for a two-year, $75.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility subject to the level of qualifying accounts receivables.
Borrowings under the facility are secured by a lien on and security interest in the related accounts receivable, as well as the associated collection bank accounts.
Advances bear interest based upon LIBOR, plus 1.50% as specified in the Receivables Loan Agreement. Advances are to be repaid in full by December 30, 2011. The Company will also pay annual fees to SunTrust equal to 0.75% of the unused portion of the accounts receivable facility. The Receivables Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for financings of this type. As of the date hereof, there were no borrowings under this facility.
Also on December 30, 2009, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF") entered into a Master Lease Agreement with BB&T Equipment Finance Corporation ("BB&T") to finance $15 million of ABF's road tractors under a thirty-six (36) month capital lease arrangement at a monthly base rent as specified in the Master Lease Agreement.

ITEM 1.02  TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
In conjunction with the creation of the accounts receivable securitization program and equipment financing described in Item 1.01 hereof, effective December 30, 2009, the Company terminated its $325,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") between the Company and its subsidiaries and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Agent and Lead Arranger, and certain other lending institutions more fully described in the Credit Agreement.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions.
 
 
 
Item 2.06  Material Impairments
     On January 21, 2010, the management of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") concluded that a noncash charge of $64.0 million, or $2.55 per share, for impairment of the value of goodwill for ABF Freight System, Inc., the Company's largest subsidiary, will be recorded in the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2009. This charge is not tax deductible and will not be tax-effected.
     The Company's goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis under applicable accounting rules. This impairment determination was made in connection with the Company's annual impairment testing and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. This impairment is a result of extremely challenging freight conditions resulting from a deep and prolonged recessionary period. Because of the length and depth of the recession, the less-than-truckload industry has been severely impacted and that impact is reflected in historically low daily tonnage levels and an aggressive pricing environment. These factors have adversely affected the recoverability of goodwill. This noncash goodwill impairment charge does not impact the Company's normal business operations, liquidity or credit availability under its existing facilities.
     Certain statements in this report are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated (expressed or implied) by such forward-looking statements, because of, among other things, the risks and uncertainties found in the Company's press releases and other SEC filings, including the risk factors identified under the heading "Risk Factors" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On January 28, 2010, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results.

ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
          (Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 28, 2010)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $88.7 million, or $3.54 per share. These results include previously disclosed charges for non-cash goodwill impairment of $2.55 per share and supplemental pension settlements of $0.11 per share. Excluding these charges, Arkansas Best had a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $22.1 million, or $0.88 per share, compared to a net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.44 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
          "Arkansas Best's fourth quarter results illustrate the impact of an extremely weak and uncertain freight environment that has continued now for forty months," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer. "This economic recession has been unprecedented in its length and depth. Its impact on the LTL industry has accelerated the level of price competition throughout 2009, and the fourth quarter was no exception."
          "Although the economy has presented us with extreme challenges, the strength of our balance sheet and the depth and experience of the ABF team have allowed us to continue our focus on enhancing our services to customers. A high standard of dependability, superior cargo care and adaptability to customer-specific requirements are the important elements of that focus," said Ms. McReynolds.

          "Our 2010 operating performance will continue to be challenged until some positive change occurs such as a better freight economy, improved pricing or some other industry catalyst. In the meantime, our company has responded to this environment by reducing headcount, equipment levels and costs in a number of areas in relation to available business levels. Our employees are doing more with less while maintaining a superior level of productivity and equipment utilization," said Ms. McReynolds. "In addition to our regular, daily management of personnel and assets, we have recently addressed our cost structure further. Because of actions we have taken, improvements in the financial markets and other events, we anticipate lower 2010 expenses in several areas of nonunion fringe benefit costs."
These items include:
     "We anticipate that the annual savings associated with these changes will be in a range of $15 - - $18 million on a pre-tax basis," said Ms. McReynolds. "We firmly believe we have the best employees in the industry and it is worth noting that they have made sacrifices for the long-term future success of Arkansas Best Corporation."
Capital Structure and Financial Resources
          "Our financial strength and stability have been valuable assets that have allowed us to endure the extended freight recession," said Ms. McReynolds. "We continue to carefully manage our balance sheet and recognize the opportunities that it presents for our company. We previously disclosed actions we took to secure our letters of credit and to enter into an accounts receivable securitization program. These actions, combined with our existing cash and short-term investments, provide our company with a level of flexibility and liquidity that is necessary to address both the opportunities and challenges of an ever-changing environment."
 
          "An additional step our Board of Directors has taken to preserve and manage liquidity in this uncertain environment is to reduce our quarterly cash dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.03 per share," said Ms. McReynolds. "We believe this dividend reduction is a prudent and responsible course of action and is in the best interest of Arkansas Best and our shareholders."

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On April 16, 2010, ABF Freight System, Inc ("ABF") a wholly owned subsidiary of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee ("TNFINC") of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT"). If ratified by a majority of eligible ABF employees, the MOU will establish a Wage Reduction  Job Security Plan (the "Plan") which will amend the 2008-2013 National Master Freight Agreement and its applicable supplemental agreements (collectively the "NMFA").
The MOU is subject to ratification by ABF employees who are members of the Company's IBT bargaining unit. The IBT is following its internal procedures with respect to a ratification vote by its ABF employee members. On Monday, April 19, 2010, the IBT announced that leaders from its local unions across the United States endorsed the MOU at a meeting conducted on that date. This endorsement was a necessary step to conduct a nationwide ratification vote by ABF employees who are IBT members. The Company anticipates that a ratification vote by ABF's IBT member employees will be completed by the end of May 2010.
The Plan contains various provisions, including the following:
The above summary description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF" or "the Company" or "the Employer") and the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee ("TNFINC") of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the "IBT" or the "Union") hereby establishes The Wage Reduction  Job Security Plan (hereinafter the "Plan") for the benefit of all of ABF's employees. This Plan has been developed for the express purpose of allowing the Employer the ability to compete and provide job security for IBT bargaining unit employees. This Plan is not, and is not intended to be, a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; rather, this Plan is an amendment to the 2008-13 National Master Freight Agreement and its applicable supplemental agreements (collectively "the NMFA") per Section 4 below that has been referred to as a Plan by the parties.
     1.During the period in which the Plan is effective (as set forth in Section 4 below), each IBT bargaining unit employee of the Employer shall participate in the Plan. For purposes of the Plan, unless expressly stated to the contrary, the term "employee" means an IBT bargaining unit employee who is on the seniority list and is scheduled to perform work for the Employer when called, including regular full-time employees, a probationary employee, a regular employee on lay off status and casuals, and including employees who work on a percentage basis less than 40 hours per week.
 Employee Eligibility.
     2.(a) Effective on the first payroll period following the date of ratification of this Plan, the Employer shall reduce by 15% the employees' gross wages or earnings paid, including the increases to wages described below in this Section 2 and the reduced wages in Section 9 below. Such wage reduction and/or reduced earnings shall include overtime and any premium pay, vacation, sick pay, holiday pay, funeral leave, jury duty, other pay for time not worked, and any other monies paid after the effective date of this Plan. Wage and mileage rate increases outlined in Article 33 of the NMFA, including increases effective April 1, 2011, and
 Wage Reduction.
 
April 1, 2012 shall also be reduced by 15%. On March 31, 2013, the wage reduction contained in this Plan shall be eliminated, and the wages under the NMFA shall revert to the full rate which would be in effect under the NMFA on March 31, 2013 without the wage reduction.
(b) In the event the Employer's publicly disclosed operating ratio is below 97.00 for any calendar year during the life of this Plan, or, alternatively, in the event the Employer's EBITDA exceeds $99.5 million for any calendar year during the life of this Plan, the wage reduction in effect on April 1 of the following year will be reduced by 5% on that date.
     3. 
Equal Sacrifice of Non-Bargaining Unit Employees and Their Participation.
(a) All non-bargaining unit employees (including management) will participate equally in the Plan, and the Employer will share the burden of sacrifices among all IBT bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees (including management), in each case, as described in this Section 3(a). The Employer must reduce the total compensation (defined as wages plus health and welfare and pension or retirement benefits) of all non-bargaining unit employees (including management) by the same percentage reduction (an "Equal Reduction") in total compensation as is being applied to IBT bargaining unit employees. Non-bargaining unit employees (including management) shall not be provided any discretionary bonus payments during the life of this Plan (these are distinct from the pre-existing incentive and performance based pay plans that are expressly allowed to continue, as noted in the final paragraph of Section 10 below). In determining the Equal Reduction for non-bargaining unit employees under this Plan, the Employer may include the monetary value of the following concessions imposed on non-bargaining unit employees starting on January 1, 2008:
 
Effective the first pay period following the date of ratification of this Plan, additional wage and benefit concessions must be imposed on non-bargaining unit employees to the extent needed to create an Equal Reduction. The Employer agrees not to increase wages (including bonuses) and benefits of current non-bargaining unit employees (including management) as an overall percentage beyond the effective overall total compensation percentage increases to be received by the bargaining unit employees. This shall not prevent the Employer from providing targeted increases to individual employees if necessary, in the Employer's judgment to operate the business, or in the event of promotions, so long as the overall total compensation increases are within the effective overall total compensation percentage increases to be received by the bargaining unit employees (consistent with Equal Reduction). This shall not prevent the Employer from paying variable, performance based compensation as the Employer has paid in past practice. If it becomes necessary to exceed this overall percentage increase limit in order to retain employees for the efficient continued operation of the business, the Employer will request approval from the Subcommittee established in Section 6 below. The Employer will be permitted to reinstate merit increases in 2011, that Employer's financial condition can support any increase to base wages.
provided
(b) The Employer and TNFINC agree to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve equal sacrifice in the total compensation of employees covered by non-Teamster and non-NMFA collective bargaining agreements.
 
     4.This Plan will be effective on the first pay period following the date of its ratification and will be mandatory for all employees, since job security is the number one asset the Employer, the Union and the employees all hope to share equally. This Plan will be submitted for secret ballot vote of all bargaining unit employees, and shall be put into effect if 50% plus one (1) of the bargaining unit employees voting, vote to adopt the Plan. The Plan will be effective on the first pay period following the date of ratification and the wages will be reduced beginning on that date (the "Effective Date"). This Plan terminates on March 31, 2013. This Plan is incorporated by reference into and shall be a part of the 2008-2013 National Master Freight Agreement and its Supplements (collectively referred to as "the NMFA").
 Effective Date; Relation to Collective Bargaining Agreement.
     5.The Employer agrees to continue to pay the full Health, Welfare and Pension contributions and increases in said contributions set forth in the NMFA and other Teamster bargaining agreements that accept the terms of this Plan and will continue for the life of this Plan to be signatory to such bargaining agreements. This Plan shall not be used by the Employer or the Union in future negotiations as a basis for arguing in favor of continuing or discontinuing the Employer's participation in the various Teamsters Pension Trusts which cover NMFA employees.
 Health, Welfare and Pension Contributions.
     6.For purposes of monitoring and maintaining compliance with the terms of this Plan, the parties will establish a four person Subcommittee consisting of the Chairman of TNFINC or his designee, the Co-Chairman of TNFINC or his designee, the Employer's President or his designee and another officer of Employer or his designee. The Subcommittee shall meet quarterly or more frequently, if necessary, to exchange and discuss pertinent data, including but not limited to relevant payroll and related information, the reinvestment of capital into the Employer, and any and all subjects related to the financial operations of the Employer. The Subcommittee's decision regarding the interpretation of this Plan shall be final and binding.
 Subcommittee to Monitor and Maintain Compliance.
     7. Disputes pertaining to the Plan are subject to the grievance procedure contained in the NMFA. However, any grievance filed hereunder, by either party, shall be referred initially to the Subcommittee established in Section 6 for disposition. If the Subcommittee fails to reach agreement, the matter will be referred to the Chairman of TNFINC and the President of the Employer in accordance with Article 8, Section 2(b)(2) of the NMFA. If the Chairman of TNFINC and the
Dispute Settlement.
 
President of the Employer are unable to resolve the matter, the 30 additional days provided in Article 8, Section 2(b)(2) of the NMFA shall be considered as exhausted and the remaining provisions of Article 8, Section 2 shall govern.
     8.An employee begins or continues participation in the Plan on the date of Plan implementation or the first day of the pay period following his/her first day of casual, regular and/or probationary employment.
 Participation.
     9.
 New Hire.
A.
Non-CDL Qualified Employees
Non-CDL qualified employees (excluding mechanics) hired after, or already in progression, on the effective date of the Plan begin participation in the Plan on their first day of employment at the following wage progression:
"NMFA Wages" means the NMFA rate for the applicable job classification after the agreed upon wage reduction.
B.
CDL Qualified or Mechanics
CDL qualified employees and mechanics hired after, or already in progression, on the effective date of the Plan begin participation in the Plan
 
on their first day of employment at the following wage progression:
"NMFA Wages" means the NMFA rate for the applicable job classification after the agreed upon wage reduction.
     10.Effective at the beginning of the next payroll period following ratification by Employer's bargaining unit employees and continuing until March 31, 2013, all regular employees (including bargaining unit, non-bargaining unit, and management employees) will participate in the Earnings Plus Plan. Under the Earnings Plus Plan, employees paid on a weekly basis will be paid a percentage of their pay earned during the weeks ending in the quarter consistent with the table below. Salaried employees will be paid a percentage of their pay earned for the three months of the quarter. Payments will be made during the month following the end of the fiscal quarter when Employer's publicly disclosed operating ratio is below 99.00 for the quarter.
 Earnings Plus Plan.
 
and so forth for each additional point.
 
For example, at an OR of 97.3 the % of pay would be 1.7%; at an OR of 94.1 the % of pay would be 5.7%
 
Example calculation:
Payout at 91.0 O.R.= ((40 x $20.03) + (7 x $30.04)) x 13 wks x 15% = $1,972.
     To save payment processing costs, any quarterly payment amount under the Earnings Plus Plan of less than $50.00 will be deferred until the total deferred amount is $50.00 or more or until 1 year has elapsed.
 
     Should the Earnings Plus Plan be ratified during a fiscal quarter, payments for that quarter will be pro-rated accordingly based on the number of weeks in the quarter.
     If for any reason wages revert to NMFA rates before March 31, 2013, then this Earnings Plus Plan shall be immediately terminated, but employees will be fully vested in the prorated share of the profits for the period of the wage reduction.
     In order to maintain the high performance levels of the past, Employer's current incentive plans for non-bargaining unit employees will remain in place and co-exist with the Earnings Plus Plan.
     11.In lieu of the receipt of wages due under the Earnings Plus Plan in Section 10 above, employees may voluntarily elect to use their wages earned under the Plan to purchase Arkansas Best Corporation ("ABC") stock utilizing the existing employee stock purchase plan. In the event the Earnings Plus Plan triggers payouts, and in the event bargaining unit recipients elect to take the payout in stock instead of cash, the Company will allow employees to use either the existing employee stock purchase plan or put the stock into their 401(k) plan subject to IRS limitations on (a) overall annual contributions that are allowed and (b) IRS limitations on the amount of ABC stock that can be put into individual 401(k) accounts. If at the time this occurs there are any legal obstacles to implementing this 401(k) option, the Subcommittee shall meet to work out an agreeable alternative to effectuate this objective as close as possible.
 Employee Option to Purchase Stock.
     12. Any employee who resigns, retires or otherwise incurs a termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, during the term of the Plan shall receive a pro rata distribution in accordance with Section 10 of this Plan based upon the date of his/her resignation, retirement or other termination of employment. In the event of death, any pro rata distribution shall be paid to the employee's estate.
Resignation, Retirement or Other Termination of Employment.
     13. The NMFA (Article 5, Section l(b)) is amended to increase the recall rights of bargaining unit employees on layoff as of the effective date of this Plan or who become laid off during the term of the Plan, from five (5) years to ten (10) years.
Extension of Recall for Laid off Teamsters.
 
     14. The Employer shall submit quarterly and annual financial statements in the format of the appropriate DOT report (formerly the BTS report) to the Subcommittee established by Section 6, and TNFINC reserves the right on an annual basis to examine records of the Employer which are reasonably required to monitor Employer compliance with this Plan or utilize an independent auditor of its choice to do the same. In consideration of the fact that TNFINC was permitted to review the Employer's financial records in connection with the negotiation of this Plan, the periodic quarterly financial review shall commence with the first full quarter after the effective date of this Plan and the first annual review of financial statements shall commence with a review of 2010 statements, as the 2009 statements were reviewed by a financial advisor selected by TNFINC as part of the negotiation of this Plan. Notwithstanding any request to the contrary, given applicable privacy laws and policies and for the protection of its bargaining and non-bargaining unit employees alike, the Employer will not share employee specific compensation information with the Subcommittee, TNFINC, or the Union other than the compensation information that Employer is required to publicly provide pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission regulation. The Union, however, retains the right to obtain compensation data on classes or groupings of non-bargaining unit employees to ensure compliance with the "Equal Reduction" requirement in Section 3 of this Plan. In the event an independent auditing firm is utilized by TNFINC, the Employer shall pay such independent auditor for such annual audit up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). As a condition of being provided such statements, books and audit, TNFINC and the Subcommittee (and any accountant or auditor engaged on its behalf) must agree to maintain the confidentiality of any Employer financial statements and reports for the protection of the Employer, and to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement if requested by the Employer in such form as the Employer may reasonably require.
Access to Employer Financial Records.
There shall be no inter-company charges initiated under the Plan for the purpose of defeating the Plan. The Employer will not change accounting assumptions or practices, except as required to conform to governmental regulations, generally accepted accounting principles or for legitimate business reasons; and in no event will such assumptions or practices be changed to evade or defeat the purposes of this Plan.
 
     15. The Employer agrees not to establish or buy any new non-union regular route common carrier entity without the prior approval of the Union. The Employer agrees that it will not use any of the savings and other economic benefits derived from this Plan to provide capital to its parent corporation for the acquisition or expansion of any operations not covered by the NMFA that will not benefit ABF. The Employer also agrees that it will not transfer bargaining unit work to any location outside of the United States. This Section 15 does not apply to the maintenance of existing operations or any existing contractual commitments. The Subcommittee created in Section 6 of this Plan will review the Employer's compliance with this Section.
Work Preservation.
     16. The Employer will not enter into any modification, expansion or amendment of its current arrangements with financial institutions or enter into new credit agreements with other lenders except on ordinary, reasonable and customary terms and conditions and at reasonable market rates of interest. The Subcommittee will be given reports of same at its quarterly meetings, and will be provided with contemporaneous notice of any material increases in the Company's credit lines or other borrowing. Any disputes on such changes to credit lines or other borrowing must be resolved by the Subcommittee within 30 days of the contemporaneous notice.
Relationship to Banking Facilities.
     In the event the Employer requires additional funds to satisfy its liquidity needs beyond those needs which exist on the date of ratification of this Plan, the Employer must obtain such additional funds by modifying, expanding or amending its current arrangements with financial institutions or by entering into new credit agreements with other lenders.
     17. The Employer agrees not to terminate the Plan before the termination date without approval of the Union. However, if the Plan is terminated with approval of the Union at any time, wage levels will revert or snap back to the full NMFA on a prospective basis and all other provisions of this Plan shall be null and void on a prospective basis, including (without limitation) Section 3. This Plan by its terms expires no later than March 31, 2013, including all provisions hereof. If, during the term of this Plan, the Employer increases its fulltime, active Teamster workforce by 20% or more from the level of fulltime, active Teamsters employed in the NMFA bargaining unit on the effective date of this Plan, the Union reserves the right to terminate this Plan with 30 days written notice; provided, the Union agrees to duly consider the profitability of the Company, or lack thereof, before terminating the Plan.
Termination/Amendment.
 
     18. The purpose of this Plan is to make a financial accommodation for the benefit of the Employer, within the meaning of Section 365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, if the Employer files a Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy petition or is placed in involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, this Plan is automatically terminated and wages reverted to full NMFA on a prospective basis, unless the Union agrees in writing to continue the Plan, and all other provisions of this Plan shall be null and void on a prospective basis, including (without limitation) Section 3.
Bankruptcy Protection.
     19. This Plan shall be applicable to the NMFA and its Supplements, which have been agreed to by the Employer and TNFINC.
Type of Agreement.
     20. The parties to this Plan agree to the attached Appendix I containing a Letter of Understanding for an Expedited Election Agreement to be used in the event that any Local Union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters obtains signed authorization cards from a majority of the employees of any non-union carrier, which the Employer, its parent or holding company or subsidiaries of the Employer buys or maintains consistent with Section 15 of this Plan.
Expedited Election Agreement.
     21. If a Change of Control of Employer (as defined below) occurs other than through a confirmation of a plan of reorganization in a Chapter 11 proceeding, this Plan is automatically terminated and wages reverted to full NMFA on a prospective basis unless the Union agrees in writing to continue the Plan, and all other provisions of this Plan shall be null and void on a prospective basis, including (without limitation) Section 3. For the purposes of this Section 21, a "Change of Control," shall be deemed to have taken place if a third person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, purchases or otherwise acquires shares of Arkansas Best Corporation ("ABC") after the date of this Agreement that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50 percent of the total voting power of the stock of where the current directors of ABC (or directors that they nominate or their nominees nominate) no longer continue to hold more than 50% of the voting power of the board of directors).
Current Ownership.
     22. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability.
 
     23. As used in this Plan, unless the context expressly requires the contrary, references to "Sections" means the sections and subsections of this Plan; references to a "party" means the Employer or the Union; references to the plural mean singular, and and references to an "Appendix" means an appendix to this Plan, which shall become an integral part of this Plan.
References.
vice versa,
In Witness of the foregoing Plan, the parties hereby acknowledge the Plan as a tentative agreement pending Employer and ABC board approval and two-man/membership ratification:
ABF Freight System, Inc.:
Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee:
 
Whenever any Local Union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (hereinafter the "Union") believes it represents a majority of the employees of any non-union carrier, which ABF Freight System, Inc. (hereinafter "the Employer"), its parent or holding company or subsidiaries of the Employer buys or maintains, in a terminal unit based on authorization cards it has obtained which would constitute an appropriate bargaining unit under normally recognized standards governing bargaining units under the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB"), the parties agree that the following process will be exclusively utilized to resolve the issue of representation. Any dispute involving this procedure discussed below shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement:
 
 
     Wherefore, the parties have set their hand to this Agreement this 16th day of April 2010.

FIRST QUARTER 2010 RESULTS
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 23, 2010)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a first quarter 2010 net loss of $21.4 million, or $0.85 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.73 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
 
"Despite some signs of improvement in our nation's economy resulting in the stabilization of our business, Arkansas Best's first quarter results illustrate the ongoing effects of low freight levels combined with a weak pricing environment.  We have continued our focus on long-term profitable growth and the customer-service-level commitments it takes to accomplish this objective," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We are encouraged by the first quarter increases in ABF's tonnage versus very low totals last year.  However, in order for ABF's operating results to improve in a meaningful way, we need further increases in freight demand, strong improvements in pricing and the positive financial impact of wage concessions."
 
Arkansas Best Corporation
 
First Quarter 2010
 
                 
Revenue of $359.9 million, a per day increase of 5.1% from prior year quarter of $339.7 million
 
                 
Net loss of $0.85 per share compared to a net loss of $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
First Quarter 2010
 
                 
Revenue of $333.0 million compared to $323.1 million in first quarter 2009, a per-day increase of 2.2%
 
                 
Tonnage per day increase of 3.3% versus first quarter 2009
 
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $23.61 compared to $23.85 in first quarter 2009, a decrease of 1.0% despite a year-over-year increase in fuel surcharge levels
 
                 
Operating loss of $35.7 million compared to an operating loss of $26.8 million in first quarter 2009
 
                 
Operating ratio of 110.7% compared to 108.3% in first quarter 2009
 
"ABF continues to offer efficient and targeted solutions that address the specific needs of our customers," said Ms. McReynolds.  "We have successfully laid the groundwork to strengthen our share in both the long-haul and regional LTL markets and we are well-positioned to leverage the superiority of our operational, sales and technology platforms in order to benefit our customers."
 
IBT Agreement and Legislative Initiatives
 
"Earlier this week, details were released regarding a tentative agreement, between ABF and the leadership of the Teamsters union, that includes 15% wage concessions and an Earnings Plus' plan that pays our union and nonunion employees when ABF's operating ratio reaches certain profitable levels. We are pleased about this tentative agreement which has the overwhelming endorsement of the Teamster leadership.  It offers ABF the opportunity to adjust its cost structure to be more comparable with the LTL marketplace," said Ms. McReynolds.  "We encourage all ABF union employees to vote in favor of this much-needed wage concession and the Earnings Plus' plan."
 
"Also, in late March, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that addresses the payment of multiemployer pension fund benefits to retirees whose companies have gone out of business and no longer make contributions to the multiemployer pension funds.  This Senate bill is similar to a bill that was introduced in the U.S. House late last year," said Ms. McReynolds.  "We fully support a legislative solution that addresses the current, inequitable situation in which some of ABF's pension contributions are, in effect, used by the multiemployer funds to pay the benefits of persons who never worked for our company.  Enactment of this legislation would be an important step toward ensuring that all of our pension payments go toward our goal of fulfilling our obligations to ABF employees and retirees who have served us so well over the years."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, May 24, 2010)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) announced today that its subsidiary ABF Freight System, Inc. did not obtain the necessary votes from its International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") employees to implement modifications to the IBT's current National Master Freight Agreement ("NMFA") labor contract with ABF.
 
The proposed modifications included a 15 percent reduction in all wages paid under the NMFA; an Earnings Plus Plan for all employees that would have paid quarterly payments when ABF's operating ratio reached certain, profitable levels and equal reduction of nonunion compensation.
 
"The current economic decline has been unprecedented in its depth and duration.  Our company, including our nonunion employees, has made significant financial sacrifices during this period.  It is unfortunate that our union employees have chosen not to participate in better aligning ABF's cost structure with those of its LTL competitors," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Going forward, we will evaluate our various options in dealing with our cost structure and the other issues we face during this challenging freight environment."

"An improvement in daily tonnage levels at ABF was the major reason our second quarter loss narrowed compared to last year," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have been encouraged by the modest, but positive, pricing trend during the quarter and the fact that our customers continue to benefit from the traditional level of superior service for which ABF is known.  However, overall freight levels and yields need to continue to improve in order for ABF to return to consistent profitability."
 
Arkansas Best Corporation
 
Second Quarter 2010
 
               
Revenue of $411.3 million, a per day increase of 13.4% from prior year quarter of $362.6 million
 
               
Net loss of $0.30 per share compared to a net loss of $0.62 per share in the prior year period
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
Second Quarter 2010
 
                 
Revenue of $379.4 million compared to $343.8 million in 2009, a per-day increase of 10.4%
 
                 
Total tonnage per day increase of 11.9% versus second quarter 2009 and a sequential increase of 14.0% versus first quarter 2010
 
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $23.59 compared to $23.81 in second quarter 2009, a decrease of 0.9%
 
                 
Operating loss of $12.6 million compared to an operating loss of $26.8 million in second quarter 2009
 
                 
Operating ratio of 103.3% compared to 107.8% in second quarter 2009
 
 
"Though some additional labor and equipment have been required as a result of the recent tonnage increases, this quarter's improved operating ratio illustrates the operating leverage that is achieved from greater freight levels moving through the ABF network," said Ms. McReynolds.
 
"Compared to second quarter last year, ABF benefited from lower nonunion fringe benefit costs which remain on track to produce yearly savings at the high end of the previously discussed $15  $18 million range. Additionally, workers' compensation and third-party casualty insurance claim costs, as a percent of revenue, were below the unusually high levels of last year's second quarter, though somewhat above longer-term historical averages."
 
"Recent competitor commentary suggests that there is a renewed industry focus on improved pricing and better operating margins," said Ms. McReynolds.  "ABF has traditionally focused on individual account profitability by offering a high level of value to its customers in return for compensatory revenues.  ABF's localized, personal service and its unique ability to do the difficult things well' results in a distinctive customer experience.  We are finding that this level of service is once again valued in the marketplace."
 
"We have been encouraged by the improved economy so far this year and its resulting positive impact on our business.  However, the economy remains fragile and we are therefore prepared for a modest rate of recovery.  Our corporate strategy is designed to effectively manage through all market conditions," said Ms. McReynolds.

ABF SEEKS IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION, FINANCIAL DAMAGES FOR VIOLATIONS OF NATIONAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN AN AMOUNT ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION
                 
ABF DEMANDS LEVEL PLAYING FIELD CONSISTENT WITH INTENT AND PURPOSE OF NMFA
 
Ft. Smith, Arkansas, November 1, 2010
 ABF Freight System, Inc. (ABF), the largest subsidiary of Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) and a leading less-than-truckload transportation company, has filed legal actions today against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and other parties including several YRC Worldwide subsidiaries (Nasdaq: YRCW) for violation of the National Master Freight Agreement (NMFA), the collective bargaining agreement covering most unionized trucking employees in the country.
 
ABF today filed a grievance under the NMFA and also an accompanying lawsuit, naming as parties the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee; Teamsters Locals 373 (Fort Smith, AR) and 878 (Little Rock, AR), individually and as representatives of a class of all Teamsters Locals that are parties to the NMFA; YRC Inc.; New Penn Motor Express Inc.; USF Holland Inc.; and Trucking Management, Inc.
 
"It is ABF's firm belief that the three rounds of concessions granted to YRC  with the latest deal just ratified last week  by the IBT are in violation of the NMFA that has been in effect since April 2008," said Wesley Kemp, President and Chief Executive Officer, ABF Freight System, Inc. "The NMFA applies equally to every company that signed it and quite simply, with these three amendments, it does not do that. We need a long-term, industry-wide solution that is fair to all NMFA parties. We have the obligation to our employees, to our customers and to Arkansas Best shareholders to enforce our rights under the NMFA and compete on the same playing field with our industry peers."
 
The legal actions, filed administratively under the contract and in federal court in Arkansas, explain in detail how the defendants violated the NMFA in 2009 and 2010 by entering into concessionary side agreements with YRC Companies to the exclusion of ABF and other companies signatory to the NMFA. These agreements led to ongoing significant wage and benefit reductions and other economic concessions that were applied only to YRC Companies,
 
and not ABF. The third and latest amendment to the NMFA is expected to "provide further wage, benefit and work rule changes that are expected to generate an average of $350 million in annual savings through the end of the extended agreement," according to YRC Worldwide Inc.'s 8-K report, filed on September 29.
 
ABF, with more than 8,000 union employees, asserts in its claims that these concessionary agreements were unlawful, unfair and inconsistent with the plain language, intent and purpose of the NMFA, and that they resulted in a substantial competitive disadvantage for ABF.
 
ABF, believing that the grievance procedure of the NMFA is fundamentally flawed by reason of conflicts of interest on the part of both labor and employer representatives who normally would be impaneled to hear ABF's grievance, seeks a legal determination to have the court create an appropriate grievance review committee to hear the grievance and resolve the dispute, or to have the contract amendments benefiting only YRC declared null and void by the court, as required by the NMFA. ABF also seeks financial damages in an amount estimated to be approximately $750 million by the time the NMFA is set to expire on March 31, 2013.
 
ABF Freight System, Inc. is represented by Littler Mendelson. A full copy of the legal pleadings can be found at www.ABFLegalAction.com.

Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated November 3, 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, November 3, 2010)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a third quarter 2010 net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
 
"Continuing improvements in ABF's year-over-year and sequential tonnage trends contributed to better operating results and a reduction in our third quarter loss versus last year and last quarter," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Throughout the third quarter, the monthly rate of increase in ABF's year-over-year tonnage improved.  In addition, sequential monthly tonnage trends during the quarter were strong compared to recent history.  Going forward, ABF must maintain freight growth combined with continued improvements in pricing in order to achieve acceptable levels of profitability."
 
Arkansas Best Corporation
 
Third Quarter 2010
 
               
Revenue of $445.5 million, a per day increase of 11.7% from prior year quarter of $399.0 million
 
               
Net loss of $0.03 per share compared to a net loss of $0.23 per share in the prior year period
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
Third Quarter 2010
 
                 
Revenue of $409.9 million compared to $369.8 million in third quarter of 2009, a per-day increase of 10.9%
 
                 
Total tonnage per day increase of 13.9% versus third quarter 2009 and a sequential increase of 6.9% versus second quarter 2010
 
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $23.38 compared to $23.98 in third quarter 2009, a decrease of 2.5%
 
 
                 
Operating loss of $2.6 million compared to an operating loss of $14.0 million in third quarter 2009
 
                 
Operating ratio of 100.6% compared to 103.8% in third quarter 2009
 
"The recent additions in shipments and tonnage that resulted in profitability improvements reflect the benefits of ABF's consultative approach with customers, leveraging the wide range of services we offer in the marketplace.  ABF's experienced employees understand our customers' supply chains and respond by applying customized solutions to meet specific needs," said Ms. McReynolds.  "In addition, consistent with the past, ABF's customers are benefiting from exceptional cargo care.  ABF's third quarter cargo claim costs, as a percent of revenue, improved versus last year, and they are on pace to be below 2009's record-setting level.  Customers value our careful handling of their shipments, making it an important element of developing long-term relationships."
 
"As market conditions have improved, the commentary on LTL pricing is more positive.  ABF is focused on increasing yields by capitalizing on opportunities to improve individual account pricing," said Ms. McReynolds.  "It is important to remember that industry pricing is at a historically low point and a return to consistent, adequate levels will take time.  Recently, ABF implemented a general rate increase and others in our industry have also announced price increases.  Though ABF's rate increase only began a little over one month ago, so far we are pleased with its level of customer acceptance.  We believe that ABF's commitment to providing high quality logistics services will result in sustained pricing improvements and the opportunity to return to consistent profitability."
 
Late-2009 changes made to various nonunion fringe benefit costs had a positive impact on third quarter 2010 results.  Arkansas Best continues to be on track to experience annual savings at the high end of the previously disclosed $15 - $18 million range.  "Again, I want to express my appreciation to our nonunion employees who have made the necessary financial sacrifices during these challenging times," said Ms. McReynolds.
 
Recently Announced Litigation
 
This past Monday, ABF filed a lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") and YRC Inc., New Penn Motor Express, Inc. and USF Holland, Inc. ("YRCW subsidiaries") seeking to declare the recently-announced ratification of modifications to the National Master Freight Agreement ("NMFA") null and void.  In addition, ABF is seeking payment for damages associated with this recent NMFA modification and two other
 
 
modifications that were granted to the YRC subsidiaries in 2009.  Approximately 75% of ABF's employees are covered under the NMFA.  ABF is an equal signatory to the NMFA which, as a national collective bargaining agreement, is designed to establish a single national standard for wages and other employment terms for all employers who are parties to the agreement.
 
"The purpose of Monday's lawsuit is to enforce the terms of the NMFA to ensure changes in wages, employment terms and conditions are not made for the exclusive benefit of one signatory party.  ABF must have an equitable cost structure and a fair opportunity to compete effectively in the LTL marketplace.  The terms of the recently approved side deal between the YRC subsidiaries and the IBT violate the provisions of the NMFA and they do not represent changes to the NMFA that are acceptable to ABF," said Ms. McReynolds.
 
Conference Call
 
Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2010 third quarter results.  The call will be today, Wednesday, November 3, at 11:00 a.m. ET (10:00 a.m. CT).  Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (888) 221-6234.

Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
 
On November 26, 2010, Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") received a notice from the Plan Administrator of the Arkansas Best Corporation 401(k) and DC Retirement Plan (the "Plan") notifying the Company of a blackout period under the Plan, pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The blackout period began at 4:00 PM Eastern Time on December 28, 2010 and ended at approximately 1:00 PM Eastern Time on January 14, 2011 (the "Blackout Period"). The Blackout Period was required due to a change in the recordkeepers for the Plan, from Fidelity Investments to Diversified Investment Advisors. During the Blackout Period, participants in the Plan were temporarily unable to direct or diversify investments under the Plan, or obtain a loan or distribution from the Plan.
 
Also on November 26, 2010, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them of the Blackout Period, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  During the Blackout Period the Company's directors and executive officers were prohibited from trading in the Company's common stock (including with respect to derivatives).
 
A copy of the notice to the Company's directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. During the Blackout Period and for a period of two years after the ending date of the Blackout Period, stockholders or other interested parties may obtain, without charge, information regarding the Blackout Period by contacting Erin Gattis, Chief of Staff, Arkansas Best Corporation, 3801 Old Greenwood Road, Fort Smith, Arkansas 72903, or by telephone at (479) 785-6000.
 
Item 8.01   Other Events.
 
On January 18, 2011, Arkansas Best Corporation's (Nasdaq: ABFS) largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System, Inc. (ABF) filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (St. Louis) from the December 20, 2010, decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas dismissing the lawsuit filed by ABF in November, 2010, Case 2:10-cv-02165-SWW ABF Freight System, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and various other parties.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(d)           Exhibits.
 
99.1         Notice to Directors and Executive Officers dated November 26, 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
                 
This notice is to inform you that the Arkansas Best 401(k) and DC Retirement Plan (the "Plan") will be changing its record-keeper from Fidelity Investments to Diversified Investment Advisors and also changing certain investment options effective January 1, 2011.
 
                 
As a result of these changes, you will be temporarily unable to direct or diversify investments in your individual account, or obtain a loan or distribution from the Plan.  This period, during which you will be unable to exercise these rights otherwise available under the Plan, is called a "blackout period."  Whether or not you are planning retirement in the near future, we encourage you to carefully consider how this blackout period may affect your retirement planning, as well as your overall financial plan.
 
                 
The blackout period for the core funds of the Plan is expected to begin at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2010 and end during the week of January 9, 2011.  If any portion of your account balance at Fidelity is held in a BrokerageLink account, the blackout period for such portion is expected to begin at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 28, 2010 and end during the week of January 9, 2011.  During these weeks, you can determine whether the applicable blackout period has started or ended by calling your new provider, Diversified Investment Advisors, toll-free at 1-888-676-5512.
 
                 
During the applicable blackout period, you will be unable to direct or diversify the affected  assets held in your Plan account.   For this reason, it is very important that you review and consider the appropriateness of your current investments in light of your inability to direct or diversify those investments during the blackout period.  For your long-term retirement security, you should give careful consideration to the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment portfolio, taking into account all your assets, income and investments.
 
                 
You should be aware that there is a risk to holding substantial portions of your assets in the securities of any one company, as individual securities tend to have wider price swings, up and down, in short periods of time, than investments in diversified funds.  Stocks that have wide price swings might have a large loss during the blackout period, and you would not be able to direct the sale of such stocks from your account during the blackout period.
 
                 
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you should contact:
 
Diversified Investment Advisors

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 3, 2011, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, February 3, 2011)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a fourth quarter 2010 net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $88.7 million, or $3.54 per share.  The fourth quarter 2009 results included charges for goodwill impairment of $2.55 per share and supplemental pension settlements of $0.11 per share.  Excluding those charges, Arkansas Best had a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $22.1 million, or $0.88 per share.
 
"Arkansas Best's fourth quarter and full year results compared to last year reflect improvement associated with increased business levels and an LTL pricing environment that began improving in the fall," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The progress we have made this year is evidence of our team's diligence in maintaining our core principles of selling value and delivering it safely and efficiently.  Our steady management and consistent actions have put us in a better position for the future.  As we move into a new year we must work hard to achieve our goal of returning to healthy profitability levels through consistent business growth and improved account pricing."

Costs for legal and advisory fees associated with ABF's union contract and litigation increased the operating ratio by 0.3% compared to a 0.1% increase in the prior year
 
"During the 2010 period of modest economic improvement, ABF experienced year-over-year increases in monthly tonnage, even as prior year comparisons became more challenging," said Ms. McReynolds.  "This improvement resulted from the efforts of ABF employees in providing a superior level of service to both existing customers and customers who were new to ABF.  In addition, some level of pricing rationality has returned to the LTL marketplace.  Several positive signs indicate that industry pricing is improving and is moving toward a more appropriate level.  At the beginning of October, ABF implemented a general rate increase of 5.9%, the second general rate increase of 2010.  Through the end of January 2011, this October general rate increase was holding well, thus positively influencing ABF's revenue and its bottom line.  In addition, ABF is benefiting from its consistent approach to account pricing as shippers once again seek the superior value that we offer," said Ms. McReynolds.
 
Legal Update
 
As previously announced, on January 18, 2011, ABF filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit regarding a December 20, 2010 decision dismissing, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a lawsuit filed by ABF in November 2010.  ABF's lawsuit was filed against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") and various other parties seeking to declare modifications to the National Master Freight Agreement ("NMFA") null and
 
void and seeking payment for damages associated with three modifications of the NMFA that were exclusively granted to the YRC subsidiaries in 2009 and 2010.  Approximately 75% of ABF's employees are covered under the NMFA.  ABF believes it is an equal signatory to the NMFA which, as a national collective bargaining agreement, is designed to establish a single national standard for wages and other employment terms for all employers who are parties to the agreement.
 
In response to motions filed by the parties, the Eighth Circuit has issued a revised briefing schedule.  ABF's opening appellant brief is due to the court on February 18.

RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends.  Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results.

ITEM 5.02  DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS
 
On February 18, 2011 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") took the following actions:
 
2011 Annual Incentive Compensation Performance Measures
 
The Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards for 2011 under the Company's Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The 2011 performance measures are weighted equally based on cash flow improvement metrics and the return on capital employed ("ROCE") for the Company.  A minimum free cash flow improvement of $20 million for 2011 (as determined in the attached form of agreement) over 2010 free cash flow (as determined in the attached form of agreement) must be achieved to earn the threshold incentive under the cash flow component of the Plan with higher levels of cash flow improvement resulting in additional earned incentive. A minimum of 5% ROCE must be achieved for an incentive to be earned under the ROCE component with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive.
 
If the target cash flow improvement is attained, the Company's President  CEO would receive $262,500; ABF's President  CEO would receive $144,200; the Company's and ABF's Senior Vice President's would each receive $71,250; and the Company's Vice President  CFO would receive $51,600 (based on their current base salary levels). At the target cash flow improvement level, no incentive would be earned under the ROCE component of the Plan. If the target ROCE is achieved, the Company's President  CEO would receive $787,500; ABF's President  CEO would receive $432,600; the Company's and ABF's Senior Vice President's would each receive $213,750; and the Company's Vice President  CFO would receive $154,800 (based on their current base salary levels). At target ROCE levels, the incentive includes amounts earned under both the ROCE and cash flow components of the Plan. The actual incentive earned will depend on the final level of cash flow improvement and ROCE achieved for 2011 and each participant's base salary earned in 2011.
 
The Committee (1) increased the ROCE threshold for the annual plan from 3% to 5% to reflect improving economic conditions and (2) capped potential annual incentive payout at a maximum payout of 250% of
the target payout factor (in prior years, the
maximum annual award was the lesser of $3 million per participant or 400% of the participant's base salary). This change reduced the maximum payout under the annual incentive plan for all participants in the plan.
 
The Company's named executive officers participate in the Company's Annual Incentive Compensation Plan.
 
The Plan was approved by on April 20, 2005 and amendment one to the Plan was approved on April 22, 2010 both by the Company's stockholders at the Company's annual stockholders meeting
 
A copy of the annual plan form of agreement approved by the Committee is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference. The Company intends to use this form of agreement from time to time in connection with awards to named executive officers and certain employees.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Pursuant to the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan and the Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Governing Plan"), the Compensation Committee of the Arkansas Best Corporation Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") has adopted the following Individual Award Opportunities, Performance Measures, and Participants for Arkansas Best Corporation, Data-Tronics Corp., Moving Solutions, Inc. and ABF Freight System, Inc. for the 20[XX]  ABC Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "20[XX]  Plan"). The Compensation Committee has determined that the 20[XX] Plan incentive will include the following components:
 
 
The weighting of the components is determined by the Compensation Committee for each Measurement Period.
 
ABase Salary for Participants other than Executive Officers is defined as a Participant's total base salary paid, while an eligible Participant in the 20[XX] Plan, for the designated Measurement Period.  Base Salary is not reduced by any voluntary salary reductions or any salary reduction contribution made to any salary reduction plan, defined contribution plan or other deferred compensation plans of the Company, but does not include any payments under the Governing Plan, any stock option, restricted stock or other type of equity plan, or any other bonuses, incentive pay or special awards.
. Base Salary.
 
B.  Base Salary for Executive Officers.
  Base Salary for Executive Officers (Executive Officer for this purpose is defined as an employee who, as of the last day of the applicable Plan Year, is covered by the compensation limitations of Code Section 162(m) or the regulations issued thereunder) is defined as an Executive Officer's total base salary paid, while an eligible Participant in the 20[XX] Plan, for the designated Measurement Period, but in no event shall the Base Salary for an Executive Officer exceed the monthly base salary for the Executive Officer as most recently approved by the Compensation Committee as of the end of the day on which the Plan is approved for the Measurement Period or, if later, the day on which the Participant becomes an Executive Officer with a salary approved by the Compensation Committee, multiplied by twelve, multiplied by 150%.  Base Salary is not reduced by any voluntary salary reductions or any salary reduction contributions made to any salary reduction plan, defined contribution plan or other deferred compensation plans of the Company, but does not include any payments under the Plan, any stock option or other type of equity plan, or any other bonuses, incentive pay or special awards.
 
C.  Measurement Period. 
The Measurement Period is 1/1/20[XX] to 12/31/20[XX].
 
D.  Retirement.
Retirement shall mean Participant's retirement from active employment by or service with the Company or Subsidiary at or after age 55, so long as the Participant has, as of the date of such retirement, at least 10 years of service with the Company or any Subsidiary. Officers and/or Executive Officers must have been a Participant in the Plan during the Plan Year for not less than ninety (90) days prior to his or her Retirement to be eligible for an incentive under the 20[XX] Plan.
 
II. Participants
 
Eligible Participants in the 20[XX] Plan are listed in Appendix C and certain employees or positions may be specifically included or excluded by the Compensation Committee.
 
Cash Flow Component:
The Individual Award Opportunities provided by the Cash Flow Plan are based on (a) achieving certain levels of Free Cash Flow that exceed 20[XX] Free Cash Flow and (b) Your Target Payout Factor Earned. The formula below illustrates how your incentive is computed:
 
A. Performance Factor Earned.
Performance Factor Earned is shown in Appendix A and depends on the Free Cash Flow improvement achieved.
 
B. Target Payout Factor.
 Your Target Payout Factor is a percentage of your Base Salary. The Target Payout Factors are listed in Appendix C.
 
ROCE Component:
The Individual Award Opportunities provided by the ROCE Plan are based on (a) achieving certain levels of performance for ABC's Consolidated Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE") and (b) your Target Payout Factor. The formula below illustrates how your incentive is computed:
 
A. Performance Factor Earned.
Performance Factor Earned is shown in Appendix B and depends on the ROCE achieved by ABC for the year.
 
B. Target Payout Factor.
Your Target Payout Factor is a percentage of your Base Salary. The Target Payout Factors are listed in Appendix C.
 
If the performance result falls between two rows on Appendix A or Appendix B, interpolation is used to determine the factor used in the computation of the incentive.
 
The Compensation Committee has established maximum incentive amounts based on a maximum Performance Factor Earned of 200% of your Target Payout Factor for the Cash Flow Component and 300% for the ROCE Component subject to the applicable weighting for each component as provided in Appendix A and Appendix B.
 
IV. Payment of Award
 
Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the end of the Measurement Period, and in any event, no later than 2  months after the end of the Measurement Period.
 
V. Annual Incentive Compensation Plan
 
Defined terms in the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan or Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan shall have the same meaning as in this 20[XX] Plan  ABC Annual Incentive Compensation Plan except where the context otherwise requires.
 
Pursuant to the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan and the Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Governing Plan"), the Compensation Committee of the Arkansas Best Corporation Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee") has adopted this Cash Flow Component as a component of the 20[XX] Plan, including the following Individual Award Opportunities and Performance Measures for Arkansas Best Corporation, Data-Tronics Corp., Moving Solutions, Inc. and ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
I. Performance Measure
 
Free Cash Flow
is defined as Operating Income or loss plus Depreciation and Amortization on Fixed Assets minus Net Capital Expenditures. For purposes of the Performance Measure, if Net Capital Expenditures are less than forecasted Net Capital Expenditures for 20[XX] by more than $[          ] the excess over $[          ] shall not be considered in determining 20[XX] Free Cash Flow improvement for the Performance Measure. In the event that Capital Expenditures exceed forecasted Net Capital Expenditures as a result of a Board approved increase subsequent to the approval by the Board of the 20[XX] forecast on 20[XX] the amount of the Board approved increase shall not reduce Free Cash Flow.
 
Net Capital Expenditures
is defined as total Capital Expenditures including capital lease assets, less proceeds for sales of capital assets, excluding capital lease sale transactions and including capitalized software.
 
Depreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets
is defined as Depreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets including depreciation of capitalized software.
 
20[XX] is defined as Free Cash Flow for 20[XX] in excess of Free Cash Flow for 20[XX].
Free Cash Flow Improvement

held by the business or incurred to acquire the business) from the denominator in the ratio calculation;
(iv)

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 25, 2011, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its first quarter results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 25, 2011)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a first quarter 2011 net loss of $12.8 million, or $0.51 per share, compared to a net loss of $21.4 million, or $0.85 per share in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Arkansas Best's first quarter 2011 results reflect continued improvements in broader economic and LTL market conditions that provided ABF the opportunity for growth in its daily tonnage levels.  While ABF was successful in adding business and improving its operating results in the first quarter, the improvements were not enough to return ABF to profitability.  ABF's results for the first quarter were impacted by the lingering effects of a weaker, recessionary pricing environment.  ABF's first quarter was also impacted by severe weather effects in January and early February as well as a significant increase in fuel costs that predominantly occurred during the last six weeks of the quarter.  Fuel surcharge caps and non-standard fuel surcharge programs played a greater role in ABF's quarterly results than in past periods of significant fuel price increases.  During March, and into the month of April, ABF has taken additional actions to increase pricing on underperforming accounts and to correct inadequate fuel surcharge programs.
 
"With the upturn in the economy and significantly less capacity serving the industry, the opportunities for ABF to grow profitably this year are favorable," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Shippers are becoming more concerned about having transportation capacity to deliver their products.  In this environment, shippers look to carriers like ABF who offer reliability, safety and a high level of customer service.  ABF's reputation for dependability and consistency is valued in the transportation marketplace and is an advantage in seeking to gain additional, profitable business during this period of economic improvement."
 
 
Arkansas Best Corporation
 
First Quarter 2011
 
               
Revenue of $434.9 million, a per day increase of 19.0% from the prior year first quarter revenue of $359.9 million
 
               
Net loss of $0.51 per share compared to a net loss of $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
First Quarter 2011
 
                 
Revenue of $402.4 million compared to $333.0 million in first quarter 2010, a per-day increase of 18.9%
 
                 
Tonnage per day increase of 17.4% versus first quarter 2010
 
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $24.16 compared to $23.61 in first quarter 2010, an increase of 2.3%, including increases in fuel surcharge
 
                 
Operating loss of $22.6 million compared to an operating loss of $35.7 million in first quarter 2010
 
                 
Operating ratio of 105.6% compared to 110.7% in first quarter 2010
 
"ABF continues to retain the general rate increase that was implemented in October.  The level of recently negotiated price increases on contracts and deferred pricing agreements has also improved.  Though some progress in returning to adequate pricing has resulted from these actions, more work is needed to align our pricing levels with the value we provide," said Ms. McReynolds.  "As a result, ABF is taking aggressive actions to improve pricing and profitability on the broad base of accounts that it serves.  There are currently several internal initiatives directed at highlighting underperforming segments of business, including revisiting substandard and capped fuel surcharge programs.  I am pleased to report that the positive effects of these efforts can be seen in April yield improvements."
 
"As the economic environment has improved, ABF's tonnage levels have continued to grow.  During each month of the first quarter our rate of positive year-over-year tonnage increased," said Ms. McReynolds.  "As in the past, there is an opportunity for ABF to benefit from operating leverage in its business."
 
In early March, ABF expanded its RPM
 regional service to the western one-third of the United States, thereby offering its Dual-System Network of regional and long-haul service coast-
 
 
to-coast.  ABF continues to listen to the needs of its customers and respond with unique supply chain solutions.  As previously announced, for the second year in a row, ABF was named the National LTL Carrier of the Year by the National Shippers Strategic Transportation Council ("NASSTRAC"), validating ABF's market excellence.
 
Legal and Legislative Update
 
On April 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit heard oral arguments on ABF's appeal of the dismissal of a lawsuit ABF filed in November 2010 against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") and various other parties. The lawsuit related to three modifications of the National Master Freight Agreement ("NMFA") that were exclusively granted to the YRC subsidiaries in 2009 and 2010.  Approximately 76% of ABF's employees are covered under the NMFA.  ABF believes it is an equal signatory to the NMFA which, as a national collective bargaining agreement, is designed to establish a single national standard for wages and other employment terms for all employer participants.  At the conclusion of the April 12 hearing, the court stated that it expected to reach a decision by July.
 
ABF makes contributions to multiemployer pension plans on behalf of its union employees.  Approximately half of ABF's union pension payments go toward the benefits of employees who never worked for the company.  Company executives are actively participating with a broad coalition of stakeholders committed to correcting this inequity.  Progress is being made in identifying legislators in Washington who are willing to work toward solving it.  Though no formal proposal has been offered, ABF will continue to work diligently in pursuit of a fair resolution of this situation.
 
Conference Call
 
Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2011 first quarter results.  The call will be today, Monday, April 25, at 11:00 a.m. ET (10:00 a.m. CT).

Explanatory Note
 
On April 26, 2011, Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the voting results at its annual meeting of stockholders on April 21, 2011 ("Original 8-K"). The Original 8-K disclosed voting results for the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, which included among other matters, both the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the executive compensation ("Say on Pay Vote") and the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation ("Frequency Vote"). This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed solely to disclose the determination of the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board") regarding how frequently the Company will include the Say on Pay Vote in its proxy materials.
 
Item 5.07.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
The Company reported, on April 26, 2011, in the Original 8-K that a majority of its stockholders entitled to vote at its 2011 annual meeting of stockholders had voted to recommend, on a non-binding advisory basis, an annual frequency for future Say on Pay Votes. The Board has determined that the Company will hold future Say on Pay Votes on an annual basis until the next Frequency Vote is conducted or until the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the Company to hold such vote with a different frequency.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, September 21, 2011)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced that Wesley B. Kemp, current President and Chief Executive Officer of its largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
("ABF"), will retire on December 31, 2011.  Roy M. Slagle, ABF's current Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, will become ABF's President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2012.
 
Mr. Kemp, who is 65 years old, has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of ABF since January 2010.  Throughout his nearly 43-year career with ABF, beginning as a management trainee in 1969, Wes continually advanced in ABF leadership positions with increasing responsibility including Regional Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Terminal Operations, Senior Vice President of Operations, President and Chief Operating Officer and his current position of President and CEO.
 
"During his ABF career that has spanned more than four decades, Wes Kemp has been an integral part of ABF's transformation from a small LTL carrier with revenues totaling $45 million and service centers in 12 states to a flexible, innovative, and full-service LTL carrier with $1.7 billion in revenues and 275 service centers across North America," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"Wes Kemp is a man of integrity and a true professional.  His hard work and dedication to detail have benefited our company during his time here.  Wes took over the leadership of ABF in the midst of one of the most severe recessions in our company's history.  His patience and guidance during this very difficult time have enabled ABF to return to profitability," said Ms. McReynolds.  "We thank Wes for his longtime service to our company and we wish Wes and his wife Sharon Ann much happiness for many years to come as they enjoy more time together."
 
Roy Slagle, who is 57 years old, has been in his current position since February 2006.  During his 35 years with ABF he also served as Vice President Administration and Treasurer, Vice President and Treasurer, and Regional Vice President of Sales.  Mr. Slagle's early years
 
 
with the company included a variety of field operations positions in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  He began his ABF career at the Dayton, OH distribution center and was the branch manager of ABF's Carlisle, PA distribution center for three years.  These are the two largest facilities in the ABF network.
 
"As a result of the operational, sales, pricing and administrative experiences that Roy Slagle has had during his ABF career, he possesses a comprehensive skill set that uniquely qualifies him to lead ABF into the future," said Ms. McReynolds.  "Roy's experience in almost every area of ABF, both in field operations and in our corporate headquarters, gives him a strong foundation from which to draw as CEO of ABF."
 
"Roy's experience and success in guiding ABF's sales, marketing and pricing efforts during a challenging period in the LTL industry will be important assets as he leads ABF in adjusting to marketplace changes and in being flexible to meet the evolving needs of our customers," said Ms. McReynolds.  "In spite of the fact that an experienced leader like Wes Kemp is retiring from our company, I feel comfortable that ABF will be in great hands under Roy's leadership."
 
Arkansas Best Corporation, headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, is a transportation holding company.  ABF Freight System, Inc., Arkansas Best's largest subsidiary, has been in continuous service since 1923.  ABF has evolved from a local less-than-truckload (LTL) motor carrier into a global provider of customizable supply chain solutions.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On October 28, 2011, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its third quarter results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, October 28, 2011)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2011 net income of $12.3 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2010.
 
Arkansas Best's third quarter 2011 performance reflects strong improvement from its largest subsidiary, ABF Freight System, Inc.  ABF produced healthy revenue and profit growth that resulted from improved account pricing in the midst of moderating tonnage levels.  ABF improved its third quarter operating ratio by four and a half operating points versus the same period last year and by over two operating points versus this year's second quarter.
 
"We are pleased to report another quarter of profitability resulting from the value and superior service that ABF offers in the marketplace.  The ABF team is to be congratulated for producing better results in the face of an uncertain economic environment," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "In looking ahead, we are prepared to appropriately adjust resources to business levels while maintaining a high level of service for our customers.  Our blend of investments in people and technology as well as the unique logistics services provided to our customers put us in a good position as we cultivate opportunities for future growth and new offerings."
 
Arkansas Best Corporation
 
Third Quarter 2011
 
               
Revenue of $510.9 million, a per day increase of 14.7% from the prior year third quarter revenue of $445.5 million
 
               
Net income of $0.46 per share compared to a net loss of $0.03 per share in the prior year third quarter
 
               
Includes market losses on the cash surrender value of life insurance of $0.05 per share compared to gains of $0.06 per share in the prior year period
 
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
Third Quarter 2011
 
                 
Revenue of $466.3 million compared to $409.9 million in third quarter 2010, a per-day increase of 13.8%
 
                 
Tonnage per day decrease of 2.0% versus third quarter 2010
 
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $27.10 compared to $23.38 in third quarter 2010, an increase of 15.9%, including increases in fuel surcharge
 
                 
Operating income of $18.3 million compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million in third quarter 2010
 
                 
Operating ratio of 96.1% compared to 100.6% in third quarter 2010
 
"Since March of this year, ABF's year-over-year change in monthly tonnage has moderated, and beginning in August, tonnage has been below that of the same period last year.  So far in October, ABF's tonnage is lower than last October by between six and seven percent, but because of greatly improved yields, ABF revenues continue to be ahead of the same period last year by approximately 5%.  We attribute the tonnage decline to weakening economic conditions, our efforts to improve account pricing and more difficult comparisons from last year," said Ms. McReynolds.  "Despite the softening in ABF's freight, our pricing levels have improved significantly from recent recessionary levels.  We constantly strive to grow ABF's business with accounts that value our wide range of services.  As a result, ABF's overall group of accounts offers a better mix of business with yields that have contributed to the improved profitability we've experienced during the last two quarters."
 
"ABF continues to focus on making investments in resources and personnel that strengthen the positive experience of our customers while improving our operational efficiencies," said Ms. McReynolds.  "In the third quarter, ABF and its exceptional employees were recognized and honored by three national publications, twice for excellence in information technology and once for ABF's commitment to sustainability.  Two ABF drivers achieved recognition for superior driving achievements, one as a national driving champion.  Earlier this month, ABF earned the American Trucking Associations' Excellence in Security Award for the sixth time of the 11 times it has been awarded," said Ms. McReynolds.  "As we move forward, we will continue to build on the strong foundation provided by ABF's nationwide network and the relationship-forming skills of its well-trained sales force to offer additional services and to take advantage of new growth opportunities."
 
Conference Call
 
Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the third quarter 2011 results.  The call will be today, Friday, October 28, at 9:30 a.m. ET (8:30 a.m. CT).

A copy of the amendment, which extends the expiration date of the Agreement from December 9, 2011 to December 9, 2013, is attached as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.

As of December 7, 2011, the Company had in place the following additional letter of credit arrangements:
 
                 
a committed revolving letter of credit facility with PNC Bank, NA in an amount not to exceed $35.0 million; and
 
                 
separate uncommitted arrangements with certain financial institutions for the discretionary issuance of additional letters of credit upon application by the Company.
 
Under its letter of credit arrangements, the Company has up to $103.1 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit of which $50.0 million is committed subject to compliance by the Company with the requirements of issuance. These financial institutions issue letters of credit on behalf of the Company primarily in support of workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims liabilities in various states in which the Company is self-insured. As of December 7, 2011, the Company had $46.2 million of letters of credit outstanding of which $45.7 million were collateralized by restricted cash equivalents and short-term investments under the LC Agreements. The Company pays quarterly fees to the financial institutions, based on the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The letter of credit arrangements contain no financial ratios or financial covenants which the Company is required to maintain. The Company had $31.3 million available as of December 7, 2011 for the issuance of letters of credit under the committed letter of credit arrangements.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On January 27, 2012, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 27, 2012)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $0.05 per share, compared to a fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.12 per share.  For full year 2011, Arkansas Best's earnings were $0.23 per share versus a loss of $1.30 per share in 2010.  These quarterly results include charges for a supplemental pension settlement of $0.03 per share related to a previously disclosed ABF executive retirement effective at the end of 2011.
 
"Arkansas Best's profitable results for the fourth quarter and full year reflect an improving business environment as characterized by revenue growth in each of our operating segments.  ABF's full-year results represent an important step toward achieving our goal of returning to historical profitability levels.  For our non-asset-based businesses, 2011 was a year of management focus and investment that laid the foundation for more significant revenue and profit growth in the future," said Judy R. McReynolds, Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our employees are to be commended for their successful efforts to address customer needs in an ever-evolving marketplace.  They continue to deliver a unique combination of complementary service offerings and value."
 
"Arkansas Best Corporation, through ABF and its non-asset-based operating subsidiaries, provides a comprehensive set of transportation and maintenance solutions to our customers," said Ms. McReynolds.  "The transportation industry is facing a number of challenges that will likely reduce the amount of capacity available to serve the marketplace.  Because of the stability of our workforce and the capabilities we offer, our companies are well positioned to serve our customers in 2012 and in future years."

On a combined basis, the non-asset-based business segments grew revenues and profits by approximately thirty percent in 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends.  Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results.

The Plan provides that if a Participant experiences a "Qualified Termination" (as defined below), the Participant will receive the following payments and benefits from the Company: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to (A) for Tier I Executives, two times the Participant's base salary in effect on the date of termination plus two times the Participant's average annual cash incentive earned during the three years prior to the year in which the date of termination occurs or (B) for Tier II Executives, one times the Participant's base salary in effect on the date of termination plus one times the Participant's average annual cash incentive earned during the three years prior to the year in which the date of termination occurs; (ii) payment of any earned but unpaid awards under the Company's annual incentive plan or successor plan which, if applicable, will be prorated to reflect partial completion of the measurement period; (iii) payment of any earned but unpaid awards under the Company's long-term incentive plan or successor plan which, if applicable, will be prorated to reflect partial completion of the measurement period; (iv) full vesting of all restricted stock unit awards and stock option awards granted to the Participant under the Company's Ownership Incentive Plan or any successor plan; (v) a lump sum payment equal to the product of (A) the monthly premium necessary to continue the medical and dental coverage in effect for the Participant and his or her spouse and dependents, if applicable, immediately prior to the date of termination, and (B) 24. A "Qualified Termination" occurs when a Participant experiences a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(h) by the Company without "Cause" (as defined in the Plan) or by the Participant for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Plan) within 24 full calendar months following a "Change in Control." In the event that a Participant experiences a Qualified Termination but dies prior to payment of the severance payments and benefits, all severance and payment benefits will be paid to the Participant's estate.
Notwithstanding the occurrence of a Qualified Termination, in the event that awards under any equity compensation plan of the Company are outstanding immediately prior to a "Change in Control" (the "Outstanding Awards") are not (i) assumed by the successor to the Company in the "Change in Control," if any (the "Successor"), (ii) replaced by the Successor with substitute awards of approximate value, (iii) accelerated such that the Outstanding Awards become vested and payable in connection with the "Change in Control," or (iv) treated pursuant to a combination of clauses (i), (ii), and/or (iii), then the Plan provides that the Outstanding Awards will become fully vested, settled and paid upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" (with any performance-based Outstanding Awards being vested, settled and paid at the maximum performance level).
 
If amounts payable to a Participant under the Plan (or pursuant to any other arrangement or agreement with the Company that are payable as a result of a change of ownership or control) (collectively, the "Payments") exceed the amount allowed under section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code, then, prior to the making of any Payment to the Participant, a best-net calculation shall be made comparing (i) the before income tax net benefit to the Participant of the Payment after payment of the excise tax, to (ii) the before income tax net benefit to the Participant if the Payment has been reduced to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the excise tax. If the amount calculated under (i) is less than the amount calculated under (ii) in the preceding sentence, then the Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the excise tax. The best-net calculation shall be made by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm or compensation consulting firm mutually acceptable to the Company and the Participant.

Arkansas Best Corporation 2012 Change in Control Plan
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
1. .

In addition, the Company considers the continued availability of the Participants' services, managerial skills and business experience to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and desires to assure the continued services of the Participants on behalf of the Company and/or its affiliates without the distraction of the Executives occasioned by the possibility of an abrupt change in control of the Company.

Awards Outstanding under Company Equity Plans.
 
6.  Mandatory Reduction of Payments in Certain Events
.
 
a. Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of a Participant (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then, prior to the making of any Payment to the Participant, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the before income tax net benefit to the Participant of the Payment after payment of the Excise Tax, to (ii) the before income tax net benefit to the Participant if the Payment had been limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. If the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount calculated under (ii) above, then the Payment shall be limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax (the "Reduced Amount"). The reduction of the Payments due hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing cash Payments and then, to the extent necessary, reducing those Payments having the next highest ratio of Parachute Value to actual present value of such Payments as of the date of the Change in Control, as determined by the Determination Firm (as defined in Section 6(b) below). For
 
purposes of this Section 6, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 6, the "Parachute Value" of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the Change in Control of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Determination Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
 
b. The determination of whether an Excise Tax would be imposed, the amount of such Excise Tax, and the calculation of the amounts referred to Section 6(a)(i) and (ii) above shall be made by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm or compensation consulting firm mutually acceptable to the Company and the Participant (the "Determination Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations. Any determination by the Determination Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Determination Firm hereunder, it is possible that at a later date, it may be determined that payments which the Participant was entitled to, but did not receive pursuant to Section 6(a), could have been made without the imposition of the Excise Tax ("Underpayment"). In such event, the Determination Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant but no later than seventy-five (75) days after the end of the calendar year in which the Underpayment is determined to exist, which is when the legally binding right to such Underpayment arises.
 
c. In the event that the provisions of Code Section 280G and 4999 or any successor provisions are repealed without succession, this Section 6 shall be of no further force or effect.
 
7. .
Restrictive Covenants
 
a. . During the period of their employment with the Company, Participants shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company and its Affiliates all trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company, and/or their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Participant. Trade secret information includes, but is not limited to, customer lists, pricing information, sales reports, strategic plans, compensation and incentive plans, financial and marketing data, information technology applications, reserves estimation processes or procedures, techniques, or processes that: (i) derive independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to persons who can obtain economic value from their disclosure or use, and (ii) are the subject of reasonable efforts under the circumstances to maintain their secrecy. While employed and at any time after termination of the Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone at any time.
Confidential Information
 
b. . The Participant agrees not to, while employed and during the 12 month period commencing upon a Qualified Termination, make any remarks (whether in public or private) knowingly or intentionally disparaging the Company or its Affiliates, or their respective products, services, officers, Directors or employees, whether past or current, including any present, former or future Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or an Affiliate.
Non-Disparagement
 
c. . Unless waived in writing by the Company, each Participant agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, while employed and during the 12-month period commencing upon a Qualified Termination, solicit or contact, directly or indirectly, the trade or patronage of any of the customers or clients of the Company, regardless of the location of such customers or clients of the Company with respect to any services, products, or other matters in which the Company is active.
Solicitation of Customers or Clients by Participants
 
d. . Unless waived in writing by the Company, each Participant agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, while employed and during the 12-month period commencing upon a Qualified Termination, solicit or attempt to entice away from the Company any Director, agent or employee of the Company.
Solicitation of Company Employees
 
e. . If a Participant breaches any of the provisions of this Section 7, the Company shall have the right to reduce or offset the Change in Control Benefits to the Participant to the extent of its damages and seek other appropriate relief (including any equitable remedy to which the Company may be entitled), including attorneys' fees.
Remedies
 
8. . No Participant entitled to receive Change in Control Benefits hereunder shall be required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to him or her pursuant to this Plan. Further, the amount of Change in Control Benefits payable hereunder shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Participant as a result of employment by another employer or otherwise. Except as provided herein, the amounts payable hereunder shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against the Participant or others. In addition, if any termination payments made to a Participant by the Company are related to an actual or potential liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) or similar law, such amounts shall reduce (offset) the Participant's Change in Control Benefit under this Plan. In the event of the Participant's breach of any provision hereunder, including without limitation, Sections 7, the Company shall be entitled to recover any payments previously made to the Participant hereunder.
No Duty to Mitigate/Set-off
 
9. . Any amounts payable pursuant to this Plan shall only be payable if the Participant delivers to the Company (and does not revoke) a release of all claims of any kind whatsoever that the Participant has or may have against the Company and its Affiliates and their officers, Directors and employees known or unknown as of the date of his or her termination of employment (other than claims to payments specifically provided hereunder, claims under COBRA, claims to vested accrued benefits under the Company's tax-qualified employee benefit plans, claims for reimbursement under the Company's medical reimbursement program for any unreimbursed medical expenses incurred on or before the Participant's date of termination, claims for unreimbursed business expenses in accordance with the Company's policy or rights of indemnification or contribution to which the Participant was entitled under the Company's By-laws, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise with regard to the Participant's service as an employee, officer or Director of the Company) occurring up to the release date in such form as reasonably requested by the Company. Such release must be executed and delivered to the Company within 60 calendar days following the Participant's Separation from Service.  To the extent a Participant's Separation from Service occurs 67 or fewer calendar days prior to December 31, any payments or benefits provided pursuant to this Plan that constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b), will be paid no earlier than the calendar year following the Participant's Separation from Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company with respect to any claim, lawsuit, action, proceeding or governmental investigation relating to the Change in Control.
Release Required
 
10. . Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company and/or its Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan.
Funding

Claims/Disputes Procedure
 
i. Prior to paying any benefit under the Plan, the Committee may require the Participant to provide such information or material as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall deem necessary for it to make any determination it may be required to make under the Plan. The Committee may withhold payments of any benefit under the Plan until it receives all such information and material and is reasonably satisfied of its accuracy.
 
ii. Any Participant who is not paid a benefit and who believes that he or she is entitled to a benefit or who has been paid a benefit and who believes that he or she is entitled to a greater benefit may file a claim for benefits under the Plan in writing with the Committee (or his or her representative may do so on his or her behalf).  In any case in which a claim for Plan benefits by a Participant (or his or her representative) is denied or modified, the Committee shall furnish written notice to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of such claim for Plan benefits (or within 180 days if additional information requested by the Committee necessitates an extension of the 90-day period and the claimant is informed of such extension in writing within the original 90-day period), which notice shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:
 
(A)
            
the specific reason or reasons for the denial or modification;
 
(B)
              
specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial or modification is based;
 
(C)
              
a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Participant or his or her representative to perfect the claim, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
 
(D)
             
an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure as contained herein, including the claimant's right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.
 
iii.
                  
In the event a claim for Plan benefits is denied or modified, if the Participant (or his or her representative) desires to have such denial or modification reviewed, he or she must, within 60 days following receipt of the notice of such denial or modification, submit a written request for review by the Committee of its initial decision.  In connection with such request, the Participant (or his or her representative) may submit written comments, documents, records and other information (without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial claim) relating to the claim for benefits, all of which, to the extent relevant, will be taken into account in the Committee's decision on review.  The claimant will be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant's claim.  Within 60 days following such request for review the Committee shall, after providing a full and fair review, render its final decision in writing to the Participant (or his or her representative, if any) setting forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant (a) the specific reasons for such decision, (b) specific references to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the decision is based, (c) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim, and (d) a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA.  If special circumstances require an extension of such 60-day period, the Committee's decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.  If an extension of time for review is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Participant (and his or her representative, if any) prior to the commencement of the extension period.  Any legal action with respect to a claim for Plan benefits must be filed no later than 180 days after the later of (i) the date the claim is denied by the Committee or (ii) if a review of such denial is requested pursuant to the provisions above, the date of the final decision by the Committee with respect to such request.
 
h. If any dispute arises between the parties with respect to the interpretation or performance of this Plan, the prevailing party in any arbitration or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party its attorneys fees, arbitration or court costs and other expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding.

Legal Fees and Expenses.
 
12. . The Participant shall be solely responsible for his or her own tax liability with respect to participation in and payments under this Plan. The Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Plan such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this Plan is intended to constitute, nor does it constitute, tax advice, and in all cases, the Participant should obtain and rely solely on the tax advice provided by the Participant's own independent tax advisors (and not this Plan, the Company, any of the Company's Affiliates, or any officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Affiliates).

ITEM 5.02  DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS
 
On February 17, 2012 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") took the following actions:
 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Compensation Performance Measures
 
The Company's stockholders originally approved the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan (the "Plan") on April 20, 2005 and subsequently approved amendment one to the Plan on April 22, 2010. Pursuant to the Plan, on February 17, 2012, the Committee established a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") for the three year measurement period of 2012-2014. The 2012-2014 LTIP performance measures are weighted equally based on the Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE") and Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") for the Company.
 
The Committee approved the performance measure and goals and the individual target incentive awards under the 2012-2014 LTIP. For the "ROCE Component" the Committee determined that it would use the Company's three year average ROCE as its performance measure and that a minimum of 3% ROCE must be achieved for an incentive to be earned with higher levels of ROCE resulting in additional earned incentive. For the "TSR Component" the Committee determined that the performance measure would be based on TSR compared to peer group as its performance measure and that a minimum 25
th
 percentile ranking must be achieved for an incentive to be earned under the TSR component with higher percentile rankings resulting in additional earned incentive.  If both the target ROCE Component and TSR Component are achieved, the executive officers of the Company and ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF") will receive the following amounts:
 
 
 
The actual incentive amount will depend on the final average ROCE achieved, the Company's TSR compared to the peer group and each participant's base salary earned in 2012 to 2014.
 
The Committee capped potential LTIP payouts at a maximum payout of 300% of the target payout factor of the ROCE Component and a maximum payout of 200% of the target payout factor of the TSR Component.
 
The peer companies for the 2012-2014 TSR Component are the following publicly traded companies:
 
                 
Celadon Group Inc.
                 
Con-Way, Inc.
                 
Covenant Transport, Inc.
                 
Heartland Express, Inc.

A copy of the LTIP form of agreement approved by the Committee is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference. The Company intends to use this form of agreement from time to time in connection with awards to named executive officers and certain employees.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Pursuant to the Arkansas Best Corporation ("ABC" or "Company") 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Arkansas Best Corporation Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") has adopted the "Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan" (the "Plan") and has determined that the Plan will include the following components for the three-year period beginning 1/1/20[XX]  and ending 12/31/20[XX]:
 
 
The ROCE Component weighting and TSR Component weighting are determined by the Compensation Committee for each Measurement Period.
 
I.

III.
Corporate Performance Metrics
 
ROCE Component:
The Individual Award Opportunities provided by the ROCE Component are based on (a) achieving certain levels of performance for ABC's consolidated Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE") and (b) your Target Payout Factor.  The formula below illustrates how your incentive is computed:
 
Your Incentive Payment = [Performance Factor Earned x Your Target Payout Factor x Your Base Salary x the ROCE Component Weighting].
 
If your job position changes during the Measurement Period, your Incentive Payment will be prorated based on the Base Salary you receive while you are an eligible participant in the Plan, the applicable Performance Factor Earned, Your Target Payout Factor and Your Base Salary assigned to each of the eligible Job Positions listed in the Plan, which you held during the Measurement Period. If you die, are Disabled or Retire as provided for under Section IV of the ROCE Component, your Incentive Payment will be prorated based on the Base Salary you receive from the beginning of the Measurement Period until the applicable date of death, Disability or retirement date.
 
A. Performance Factor Earned
.
Performance Factor Earned is shown in Appendix A and depends on the ROCE achieved by ABC for the Measurement Period.
 
B. Target Payout Factor
.
Your Target Payout Factor is a percentage of your Base Salary.  The Target Payout Factors are listed in Appendix C.
 
TSR Component:
The Individual Award Opportunities provided by the TSR Component are based on (a) the percentile rank of the Company's Compounded Annual Growth Rate ("CAGR") of Total Shareholder Return relative to the Peer Companies over the Measurement Period and (b) your Target Payout Factor.  At the end of the Measurement Period, the percentile rank of the Company's CAGR Total Shareholder Return will be calculated. Any Peer Company that is no longer publicly traded shall be excluded from this calculation. The formula below illustrates how this portion of your incentive is computed:
 
Your Incentive Payment = [Performance Factor Earned x Your Target Payout Factor x Your Base Salary x TSR Component Weighting].
 
If your job position changes during the Measurement Period, your Incentive Payment will be prorated based on the Base Salary you receive while you are an eligible participant in the Plan, the applicable Performance Factor Earned, Your Target Payout Factor and Your Base Salary assigned to each of the eligible Job Positions listed in the Plan, which you held during the Measurement Period, If you die, are Disabled or Retire as provided for under Section IV of the TSR Component, your Incentive Payment will be prorated based on the Base Salary you receive from the beginning of the Measurement Period until your date of death, Disability or retirement date.
 
A. Performance Factor Earned
.  
The Performance Factor Earned is shown in Appendix B and depends on the Company's Compounded Annual Growth Rate of Total Shareholder Return over the Measurement Period as compared to the Peer Companies.
 
B. Target Payout Factor
.
Your Target Payout Factor is a percentage of your Base Salary. The percentage varies for each level of management within the Company.  The Target Payout Factors are listed in Appendix C.
 
If the performance result falls between two rows on Appendix A or Appendix B, interpolation is used to determine the factor used in the computation of the incentive.
 
In no event will the Target Payout Factor used to calculate the incentive amount exceed the maximum factor of 85% provided in Appendix C.
 
The Compensation Committee has established maximum incentive amounts based on a maximum Performance Factor Earned of 200% for the TSR Component and 300% for the ROCE Component subject to the applicable weighting for each component as provided in Appendix A and Appendix B.
 
The terms of the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan  ROCE Component and the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan  TSR Component are incorporated into the Plan.
 
IV.
Payment of Award
 
Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the end of the Measurement Period, and in any event, no later than 2  months after the end of the Measurement Period.
 
V.
2005 Ownership Incentive Plan
 
Defined terms in this Plan shall have the same meaning as in the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan, except where the context otherwise requires.
 
No term or provision in this Plan may conflict with any term or provision of the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan. It is specifically intended that the Plan, ROCE Component and TSR Component be an "Award Agreement" and the incentives paid hereunder be an "Award" under the terms of the 2005 Ownership Incentive Plan.
 
The Compensation Committee of the Arkansas Best Corporation Board of Directors has adopted this ROCE Component of the Plan ("ROCE Component"), including the following Individual Award Opportunities, Performance Measures and Participants for Arkansas Best Corporation, Data-Tronics Corp. and ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF") for the three-year period beginning 1/1/20[XX] and ending 12/31/20[XX].
 
I.
Performance Measure
 
ROCE for ABC is calculated as the following ratio for the Measurement Period:
 
"Net Income" for the ROCE calculation is consolidated net income for the Measurement Period determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles after taking into account the Section II Required Adjustments.
 
"Interest Expense" for the ROCE calculation is (i) interest on all long and short-term indebtedness and other interest bearing obligations and (ii) deferred financing cost amortization and other financing costs, including letters of credit fees for the Measurement Period.
 
"Imputed Interest Expense" consists of the interest attributable to Average Imputed Debt assuming an interest rate of 7.5% for the Measurement Period.
 
"Average Equity" is the average of the beginning of the Measurement Period and the end of the Measurement Period stockholder's equity.
 
"Average Debt" is the average of the beginning of the Measurement Period and the end of the Measurement Period current and long-term debt.
 
"Average Imputed Debt" consists of the average of the beginning of the Measurement Period and the end of the Measurement Period present value of all payments determined using an interest rate of 7.5% on operating leases of revenue equipment with an initial term of more than two years.

Death; Disability; Retirement
.  Upon termination of Participant's employment with the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of Participant's death, Disability or Retirement (as defined in the Plan), Participant's Incentive Payment shall be prorated based on the period of participation in the Plan, provided that Participant's Incentive Payment shall be computed and paid in the normal course of business after the end of the Measurement Period. Provided, however, an employee must have completed at least 12 months of the Measurement Period to be entitled to an Incentive Payment under this Section IV(b).
 
(c)
         
Change in Control
. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Participant shall be entitled to immediate payment of the greater of the following:

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 27, 2012, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its first quarter results. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.

Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated April 27, 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 27, 2012)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced a first quarter 2012 net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.71 per share, compared to a net loss of $12.8 million, or $0.51 per share in the first quarter of 2011.  Arkansas Best's first quarter 2012 results were impacted by a number of unusual items which are listed below with the corresponding diluted per share effect:
 
                 
Low corporate tax benefit rate  ($0.18/share)
 
                 
High ABF workers' compensation costs  ($0.13/share)
 
                 
Investments in sales, customer service and IT for all subsidiaries  ($0.12/share)
 
The unusually low corporate tax benefit rate is below historical levels because of limitations on the amount of deferred tax assets that could be recorded during the quarter.  Depending on the financial results during the remainder of the year, Arkansas Best's quarterly tax rates will vary and the 2012 full year tax rate could be substantially lower than past, full year tax rates.  ABF's workers' compensation claims costs were significantly above ten-year historical averages due to unfavorable severity on new and existing claims and increases in loss development, driven by claims experience.  This cost increase is very unusual for ABF.  On a positive note, organic investments are being made for ABF and the non-asset based subsidiaries in sales, customer service and information technology ("IT") to improve operating efficiencies and support specific growth opportunities.  The investments being made are expected to improve the operating results of these companies during 2012.
 
In addition to the above-referenced unusual items, ABF results were also impacted by decisions to maintain customer service levels despite lower daily tonnage in the first quarter.  ABF's daily tonnage levels were impacted by pricing actions taken throughout 2011, and an economic environment that was sluggish and inconsistent, despite some improvement throughout the first quarter.  First quarter 2011 results included the effects of adverse weather which dampened that period's tonnage growth by approximately two percent.  As a result, first quarter 2012 tonnage is effectively below last year by over twelve and a half percent.  It is typical in the first quarter of each year for ABF to have lower business levels and changes in freight mix that reduce capacity utilization and cause a higher portion of ABF's
 
cost structure to become fixed in nature, relative to the seasonally stronger periods of the year.  However, the level of daily tonnage declines in this year's first quarter exacerbated that effect.
 
"Although first quarter results do not meet our expectations, we are positioning our company for longer term success," said Arkansas Best President and CEO, Judy R. McReynolds.  "The pricing measures we have taken have improved the incremental profitability of ABF's account base for future periods.  Our deliberate actions of adding personnel and developing enhanced information technology systems, all designed to advance a high level of service and facilitate future growth, are essential investments for our company.  Our customers value our reliability and dependability.  They are looking for a business partner who works closely with them to meet their unique logistics needs and requirements."
 
April 2012 Update
 
On a sequential basis versus the same period in March, tonnage trends in April 2012 are the best ABF has experienced in over 20 years.  The recent strength in business is associated with freight from new customers, additional shipments from existing accounts and the return of previously lost customers in response to service failures by competitors. Although, as expected, ABF's April 2012 tonnage is below the same period last year, the comparative trends are above expectations and encouraging.
 
Continuing a trend that began in the second quarter of 2011, ABF was able to achieve superior, quarterly price increases in a multi-year effort to restore adequate pricing levels while emerging from the depths of a severe recession.  April 2012 revenue per hundredweight including fuel surcharge continues to be positive, reflecting an improved pricing environment.
 
Recent operational changes to ABF's labor contract were implemented, in a phased approach, from late March through the latter portion of April.  A positive impact from these changes should result from improved efficiencies, more flexible utilization of employees and enhancements in ABF's on-time delivery service.  This is an example of positive changes allowed by our existing contract that can benefit ABF, its customers and its employees.

Panther Stock
Transaction
 
In connection with the Transaction, on June 15, 2012, Arkansas Best and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $100.0 million secured term loan facility with U.S. Bank National Association, as Administrative Agent and as a lender, Branch Banking and Trust Company and PNC Bank, National Association, as syndication agents and as lenders, Regions Bank, as a lender, and The First National Bank of Fort Smith, as a lender (the ""), to finance a portion of the Transaction.  (See Item 2.03 below for a description of the Financing.) The balance of the funds needed to pay the consideration payable to the Sellers and others in the Transaction was funded out of Arkansas Best's available cash.
Financing
 
The Sellers, Panther Expedited and Arkansas Best, made detailed representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement.  Each party's obligation to consummate the Transaction was generally conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the counterparties' representations and warranties being true, in all material respects, as of the closing, (ii) the counterparties' performance, in all material respects, of all covenants required to be performed prior to closing, (iii) the receipt of all documents, instruments, certificates or other items required to be delivered at or as of the closing by the other parties to the Purchase Agreement, and (iv) the absence of legal matters prohibiting the Transaction.  Additionally, Arkansas Best's obligation to consummate the Transaction was conditioned upon the consummation of the Financing and the continued employment of certain executive officers of Panther Expedited.
 
The Purchase Agreement provides for certain indemnification obligations of the Sellers and Arkansas Best.  At closing $22.5 million was placed in escrow to secure the Sellers' indemnification obligations to Arkansas Best as well as the post-closing true up of the purchase price.
 
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Panther Expedited or the parties to the Purchase Agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged among the parties in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement. The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing those matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of Arkansas Best, the Sellers or Panther Expedited or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Arkansas Best's public disclosures.

Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
The disclosure contained in Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On June 15, 2012, Arkansas Best entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Arkansas Best and certain of its subsidiaries that become party thereto from time to time, as borrowers, U.S. Bank National Association and the other financial institutions named therein, as lenders, and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent ("").  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the lenders party thereto provided a $100.0 million secured term loan (the "") to Arkansas Best, which Term Loan was used to finance the Transaction described in Item 1.01 above.  The Credit Agreement also provides Arkansas Best with the right to add revolving commitments thereunder up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million (the ""), subject to the satisfaction of certain additional conditions provided therein.
Administrative Agent
Term Loan
Accordion Feature
 
The Term Loan is secured by: (i) a lien on certain of the assets of Arkansas Best and its Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) pledges of 100% of the equity interests in certain of Arkansas Best's domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests in certain of Arkansas Best's foreign subsidiaries.  The indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, along with certain hedging obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates and certain other obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates, are cross-guaranteed by Arkansas Best and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
The Term Loan matures on June 15, 2017 (the "") and borrowings under the Credit Agreement can either be, at the applicable borrower's election: (i) at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a spread ranging from 0.25% to 1.50% or (ii) at the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a spread ranging from 1.25% to 2.50%.  The applicable spread is dependent upon Arkansas Best's Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter referred to in the most recent financials delivered by Arkansas Best to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement.  Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Termination Date.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is payable on the last day of the applicable interest period, on such sooner date as such Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, on the Termination Date and, in the case of Eurodollar Advances with interest periods greater than three months, on the last Business Day of each three-month interval during such interest period.
Termination Date
 
Commencing September 30, 2012, the outstanding principal of the Term Loan is required to be repaid by Arkansas Best in quarterly installments, each in an aggregate principal amount ranging from $2.5 million to $4.375 million, with any remaining unpaid principal to be paid in full on the Termination Date.  Upon the occurrence of certain events, including asset sales by Arkansas Best and its subsidiaries exceeding $15.0 million in the aggregate in any fiscal year, receipt by such persons of insurance or condemnation proceeds, the incurrence by such persons of subordinated indebtedness (other than up to $10.0 million in connection with Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or other acquisitions consented to by the lenders) and certain sale and leaseback transactions involving consideration payable to Arkansas Best or its subsidiaries exceeding $15.0 million at any time outstanding, the net proceeds of such events must be used to prepay the Term Loan unless they are otherwise reinvested in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.  Arkansas Best may prepay all loans under the Credit Agreement at any time without penalty or prepayment premium, except for payment of certain breakage and related costs.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, (i) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and (ii) limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, purchases and sales of assets. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, conditions, representations and warranties and indemnification provisions.
 
Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), including but not limited to nonpayment of principal when due, failure to perform or observe certain terms, covenants or agreements under the Credit Agreement, and certain defaults of other indebtedness, the Administrative Agent may terminate the obligation of the lenders under the Credit Agreement to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. In addition, in the event of insolvency (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the obligation of each lender to make advances shall automatically terminate and any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement shall immediately become due and payable.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
 
Affiliates of certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to Arkansas Best and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received, and may continue to receive, customary fees and commissions.

If the Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim, including by retaining and (upon the Defending Party's request) providing to the Defending Party all records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(a)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof.
 
(c)           The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
prima facie
provided, however
 
(d)           Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note representing its Loans, substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a "Note").  In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note payable to such Lender in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Lender subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (b)(i) and (ii) above.
 
2.11.      
Telephonic Notices
.  Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of
Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic or e-mail notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrowers, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically and by e-mail.  Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation (which may include e-mail) of each telephonic or e-mail notice authenticated by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent demonstrable error.  The parties agree to prepare appropriate documentation to correct any such error within ten (10) days after discovery by any party to this Agreement.
2.12.      
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
.  Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such Payment Date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest on all Advances and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except that interest at the Base Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 1:00 (Central time) at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
2.13.      
Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.  The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
 
2.14.      
Lending Installations
.  Each Lender may book its Advances at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
 
2.15.      
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent
.  Unless a Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, a payment of principal, interest or fees to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.  The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
2.16.      
Replacement of Lender
.  If any Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to make a Loan or declines to approve an amendment or waiver that is approved by the Required Lenders or otherwise becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Borrowers may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash at par the Advances and other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrowers shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrowers hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5.

2.17.      
Limitation of Interest
.  The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable laws, including applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 2.17 shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section 2.17, even if such provision declares that it controls.  As used in this Section 2.17, the term "interest" includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable law, that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of this Agreement.  In no event shall any Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any right or privilege to
provided
reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the applicable laws (if any) of the United States or of any applicable state, or (b) total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of this Agreement at the Highest Lawful Rate.  On each day, if any, that the interest rate (the "Stated Rate") called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence.  Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate.  The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made.  None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.17, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the term of any Loan or any other Obligation outstanding hereunder or under the other Loan Documents is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Event of Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Lender, it shall be credited against the then-outstanding principal balance of the Borrowers' obligations to such Lender, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.

(ii)
                                 
Payments
. The Administrative Agent shall apply any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by it from or for the account of a Defaulting Lender as the Administrative Agent may determine in its discretion.
(b)           .  If the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and , , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

Designation of Borrowing Subsidiaries
.  The Parent may from time to time request that a Material Domestic Subsidiary be added to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as an additional Borrower with the ability to request and receive Loans from the Lenders (each, a "Borrowing Subsidiary").  Each such request shall be delivered in writing to the Administrative Agent and shall specify the name of such Material Domestic Subsidiary, such Material Domestic Subsidiary's jurisdiction of organization, and the Business Day on which the Parent would like such joinder to be given effect.  Such request shall be delivered at least thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as may be approved by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) prior to the date on which the Parent wishes to join such Borrowing Subsidiary hereto, and shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The Administrative Agent, subsequent to its receipt of such request, may ask the Parent for additional information related to the proposed Borrowing Subsidiary in its reasonable discretion.  In order to join a Borrowing Subsidiary hereto, the Parent shall cause the delivery or satisfaction of the following to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days (or such shorter period as may be approved by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) prior to the date on which the Parent has requested that such joinder be given effect: (i) a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by the Parent, the applicable Borrowing Subsidiary and the Administrative Agent, in the form of Exhibit I-1 hereto or otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such Borrowing Subsidiary shall agree to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and shall be entitled to request and receive Loans hereunder, (ii) joinder agreements to each of the Guaranty and the Security Agreement, (iii) each of the other Collateral Documents that the Administrative Agent may request, (iv) documentation evidencing the requisite changes to Section 5.12(ii) and (v) all other conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.3.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide a copy of such Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement to the Lenders.  Upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 2.19, the applicable Borrowing Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a party to this Agreement until the Parent shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Material Domestic Subsidiary, whereupon such Material Domestic Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement.  Each Material Domestic Subsidiary that is or becomes a Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant hereto hereby irrevocably appoints the Parent as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each related document, including service of process.

Increase Option
.  So long as the Borrowers' Qualified Receivables Transactions shall have terminated or will contemporaneously terminate and the accounts or notes receivable thereunder have been pledged or will be contemporaneously pledged as Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.24, the Borrowers may from time to time elect to add senior secured revolving loan commitments hereto, in each case in minimum increments of $10,000,000 or such lower amount as the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent agree upon, so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such senior secured revolving loan commitments does not exceed $75,000,000 (such additional senior secured revolving loan commitments, the "Additional Commitments").  The Borrowers may arrange for any such Additional Commitments to be provided by one or more Lenders (each such Lender, an "Increasing Lender"), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities that are Eligible Assignees (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an "Augmenting Lender"), to extend the Additional Commitments; that (i) each Augmenting Lender and each Increasing Lender shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrowers and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrowers and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto.  No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the Additional Commitments) shall be required for any Additional Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20.  Additional Commitments created pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Commitments (or any Lender's Additional Commitment) shall become effective under this section unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such addition, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.2 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Parent and (B) the Parent shall be in compliance (on a pro forma basis reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) with the covenants contained in Section 6.23 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents (A) consistent with those delivered on the date hereof as to the corporate power and authority of each Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such addition and (B) as it may request to evidence termination of the Qualified Receivables Transactions and the pledge of the accounts or notes receivable thereunder as Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.24.  On the effective date of any Additional Commitments, each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such addition, each Lender's portion of the outstanding revolving loans of all the Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders to equal its pro rata share of such outstanding revolving loans.  Additional Commitments shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Loans hereunder.
provided
 
Additional Commitments may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an "Additional Commitment Amendment") of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrowers, each Increasing Lender, each Augmenting Lender and the Administrative Agent at the time this Section 2.20 is exercised, and
reflecting additional terms deemed standard and customary in the market at that time for a revolving credit facility (including, without limitation, requisite changes to Section 5.12(ii), a commitment fee or facility fee in respect of the revolving commitments, letter of credit and swing line mechanics (including related fees), and associated consent rights (such as, but not limited to, letter of credit issuers having the ability to consent to Persons (including Lenders) taking assignments of revolving commitments)).  The applicable interest rate margins applicable to the Additional Commitments shall be determined by the Borrowers and the Lenders thereunder; , that in the event the applicable interest rate margin for any Additional Commitment is higher than the Applicable Margin for the Loans by more than 50 basis points, then the Applicable Margin for the Loans shall be increased to the extent necessary so that such Applicable Margin is equal to the applicable interest rate margins for such Additional Commitment minus 50 basis points; , that in determining the applicable interest rate margins for the Additional Commitments and the Loans, (i) customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to the Arranger (or its Affiliates) in connection with the Loans or any Additional Commitment shall be excluded, and (ii) if an Additional Commitment includes an interest rate floor greater than the interest rate floor applicable to the Loans, such increased amount shall be equated to the applicable interest rate margin for purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Margin for the Loans shall be required, to the extent an increase in the interest rate floor for the Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Margin) applicable to the Loans shall be increased by such amount.  The Additional Commitment Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to provide Additional Commitments, at any time.

(b)           imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or
 
(c)           imposes any other condition (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans, or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurodollar Loans or participations therein held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender as the case may be,
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Person of making or maintaining its Loans or Commitment or to reduce the amount received by such Person in connection with such Loans or Commitment, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Person, the Borrowers shall pay such Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Person for such increased cost or reduction in amount received; that such demand is made within 270 days after the occurrence of any such Change in Law.

rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances is not ascertainable or does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Base Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.
3.4.        
Funding Indemnification
.  If (a) any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, (b) a Eurodollar Advance is not made on the date specified by a Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, (c) a Eurodollar Loan is converted other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (e) any Eurodollar Loan is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, the Borrowers will jointly and severally indemnify each Lender for such Lender's costs, expenses and Interest Differential (as reasonably determined by such Lender in good faith) incurred as a result of such prepayment.  The term "Interest Differential" shall mean that sum equal to the greater of zero or the financial loss incurred by the Lender resulting from prepayment, calculated as the difference between the amount of interest such Lender would have earned (from the investments in money markets as of the Borrowing Date of such Advance) had prepayment not occurred and the interest such Lender will actually earn (from like investments in money markets as of the date of prepayment) as a result of the redeployment of funds from the prepayment.  Because of the short-term nature of this facility, Borrowers agree that Interest Differential shall not be discounted to its present value.

Taxes
 
(a)           Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings of Indemnified Tax or Other Tax applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)           The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(c)           The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Lender or the Administrative Agent, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.5) payable or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender or the Administrative Agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)           Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.2(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)           As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)            (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to
any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A) any Lender that is a United States Person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;
 
(B) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(ii)  executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(iii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of a Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
 
(iv) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8IMY or IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable.
 
(C)  any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly
completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender or Administrative Agent under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or Administrative Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or Administrative Agent has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(iii)          Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(g)           If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h)           Each party's obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
3.6.        
Selection of Lending Installation; Mitigation Obligations; Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
.  To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written statement.  The obligations of the Borrowers under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

No Tax Liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.
 
5.7.        
Litigation and Contingent Obligations

Lender Credit Decision, Legal Representation
.
(a)           Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Parent and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Except for any notice, report, document or other information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent or Arranger hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall have any duty or responsibility (either initially or on a continuing basis) to provide any Lender with any notice, report, document, credit information or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any Borrower or any of the Borrowers' Affiliates that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or Arranger (whether or not in their respective capacity as Administrative Agent or Arranger) or any of their Affiliates.
 
(b)           Each Lender further acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to be represented by legal counsel in connection with its execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, that it has made its own evaluation of all applicable laws and regulations relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the counsel to the Administrative Agent represents only the Administrative Agent and not the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
10.12.    
Successor Administrative Agent
.  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five (45) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign.  The Administrative Agent may be removed at any time that it constitutes a Defaulting Lender by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty (30) days after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent may at any time, with the consent of the Parent (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), and without the consent of any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder.  If the Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Borrowers shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders.  No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment.  Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In the event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent.

10.14.    
Delegation to Affiliates

10.16.    
Collateral Releases
.

provided
requirements of such definition, it shall be required to become a Guarantor under the Loan Documents pursuant to Section 6.24(a).
 
10.17.    
Syndication Agents, etc
.  Neither any of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in Section 10.11.
 
10.18.    
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
.  In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i)(A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Lenders are arm's-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) each Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) each Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii)(A) each of the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for any Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) no Lender has any obligation to any Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers and their Affiliates, and no Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrowers or their Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against each of the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
 
11.1.      
Setoff
.  Each Borrower hereby acknowledges the setoff right that each Lender retains in all deposits, credits and deposit accounts (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) of such Borrower with such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender (the "Deposits").  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Event of Default occurs, such Borrower authorizes each Lender to offset and apply all such Deposits toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty or any other security, right or remedy available to such Lender or the Lenders; , that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative

Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
11.2.      
Ratable Payments
.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral or other protection ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.
 
12.1.

The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; , , that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3.  The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; , that the Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another Person.

assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.
12.2.      
Participations

Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
Permitted Participants; Effect
 
(b)           .  Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents that each such Lender may agree in its participation agreement with its Participant that such Lender will not vote to approve any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Outstanding Credit Exposure or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3 or of any other Loan Document.
Voting Rights
provided
 
(c)           .  Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.  The Borrowers further agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 9.6 and 9.10 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.5(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.5(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, that a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrowers.  Each Lender that sells a

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

12.3.      
Assignments
.
 
(a)           .  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000.  The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or Outstanding Credit Exposure (if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the assignment.

(b)           .  The consent of the Borrowers shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, that the consent of the Borrowers shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; that the Borrowers shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless they shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof.  The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.

The
Effect; Effective Date
 
assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.  In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3(c), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.
(d)           .  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States of America, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender, pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Register
 
(e)           .  Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any information contained in any Reports; that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.

ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On June 15, 2012, ABF Freight System, Inc. (ABF), the largest subsidiary of Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) entered into a Receivables Loan Agreement ("the Agreement") among ABF Freight Funding LLC, as Borrower, ABF Freight System, Inc., as initial Servicer and PNC Bank, National Association, as the Lender, the LC Issuer, and as Agent for the Lender. A copy of the agreement is attached as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Receivables Loan Agreement, which matures on June 15, 2015, provides for a $75.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility subject to the level of qualifying accounts receivables. Any future borrowings under the facility would be secured by a lien on and security interest in the related accounts receivable, as well as the associated collection bank accounts. Advances have no scheduled maturity date, and are payable upon termination of the Agreement. Advances bear interest based upon LIBOR, plus a margin as specified in the fee letter. ABF Freight Funding LLC, a subsidiary of Arkansas Best Corporation, also pays fees to the agent, for the account of the Lender, based on the amount of the accounts receivable facility.
 
Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Amortization Event (as defined in the Agreement), including but not limited to nonpayment of fees when due, failure to perform or observe certain terms, covenants or agreements under the Agreement, in the event of insolvency and certain defaults of other indebtedness, the administrative agent may terminate the obligation of the lenders under the Agreement to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable.
 
The Receivables Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for financings of this type. As of the date hereof, there have been no borrowings under this facility. The Agreement includes a provision under which the Borrower may request and the LC Issuer may issue standby letters of credit, primarily in support of workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims liabilities in various states in which certain subsidiaries of Arkansas Best Corporation are self-insured. Outstanding standby letters of credit reduce the availability of borrowings under the facility. As of the date hereof, $2.2 million of standby letters of credit have been issued under the facility which reduced the available borrowing capacity to $72.8 million.

The LC Issuer shall not be liable for (i) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit; (ii) any error in translation or interpretation of technical terms; (iii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iv) the failure of any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon any Letter of Credit; or (v) any other consequences arising from causes beyond the LC Issuer's or the LC Issuer's correspondents' control, except for actions, errors or
omissions constituting or caused by the LC Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.

The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

The LC Issuer shall not be obligated to modify any Letter of Credit if (A) the LC Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.

The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Agent or the Lender under this Agreement.

The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to the Borrower any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness owing to the Borrower not constituting Purchased Receivables.  The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of the Agent or the Lender, furnish to the Lender (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for the Lender pursuant to Article II.
 
(f)
           
Any payment made by an Obligor that is not specified by such Obligor to relate to a particular invoice or other obligation of such Obligor to the Originator, FreightValue or the Borrower, except as otherwise  required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Agent, shall be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor.

In case any authorized signatory of the Borrower whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force.  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent, and agrees that the Agent shall be entitled (a) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices, to endorse the Borrower's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (b) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to enforce the Purchased Receivables, the related Contracts (other than any Master Contract which contains a prohibition against the assignment thereof) and the Related Security, and (c) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other

Section 8.4.
         
Responsibilities of the Borrower
.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the exercise by the Agent, on behalf of the Lender, of the Agent's rights hereunder shall not release the Servicer, the Originator, FreightValue or the Borrower from any of their duties or obligations with respect to any Purchased Receivables or under the related Contracts.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 31, 2012, Arkansas Best Corporation issued a press release announcing its second quarter results. The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. The press release also contains calculations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations. A copy of the press release is furnished as an exhibit to this Report on Form 8-K.

Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated July 31, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, July 31, 2012)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced second quarter 2012 net income of $11.8 million, or $0.44 per share, on revenue of $511 million, compared with net income of $5.3 million, or $0.20 per share, and revenue of $499 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 
The second quarter 2012 results included a tax benefit of $8.0 million, or $0.31 per share, related to the reversal of previously established deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and transaction costs of $2.1 million ($1.3 million, after tax), or $0.05 per share, associated with the June 15, 2012 acquisition of Panther Expedited Services, Inc. ("Panther").  Excluding both of these items, Arkansas Best had second quarter 2012 net income of $5.2 million, or $0.18 per share.
 
"A number of significant developments occurred during the second quarter, including closing the acquisition of Panther, our premium logistics provider," said Arkansas Best President and CEO Judy R. McReynolds.  "This transaction represents a major step in our long-term strategy to grow our non-asset-based businesses.  If Panther had been included, total 2011 revenues for Arkansas Best's non-asset businesses would have exceeded $400 million.  The addition of Panther and the services provided by our other non-asset-based subsidiaries complement our offerings at ABF and allow us to strengthen customer relationships."
 
 
ABF implemented a 6.9% increase in its general rates and charges on June 25, 2012 that was in effect during the last week of the second quarter.  Second quarter price increases on ABF accounts under contract and deferred pricing agreements remained at favorable levels.  In the second quarter of 2011, ABF began an aggressive initiative to address inadequate pricing and improve the profitability of many accounts across its network.  This effort continues in 2012.  As a result, the incremental profitability of ABF's account base has improved.
 
"While we are encouraged by ABF's yield initiatives, we continue to focus on various paths to reduce ABF's overall cost structure," said Ms. McReynolds.  "On-going efforts that offer opportunities to reduce ABF's cost structure include ABF's labor contract lawsuit, collaborative work to develop a permanent solution to correct our payment of non-ABF multiemployer pension benefits and preparations for negotiation of a new April 2013 labor contract."
 
ABF's second quarter 2012 daily tonnage levels continued to be below those of the same period last year as the U.S. economy remained inconsistent.  However, in each month of this year's second quarter, the level of tonnage decrease improved versus 2011.  During the second half of 2012, monthly tonnage levels will be compared back to the second half of 2011, when ABF experienced declining tonnage versus 2010.
 
Acquisition of Panther Expedited Services, Inc.
 
As previously announced, Arkansas Best acquired Panther on June 15, 2012.  The aggregate purchase price of approximately $181 million included a preliminary post-closing adjustment to net working capital.  Arkansas Best did not assume any of Panther's debt that existed prior to the acquisition.
 
In connection with this purchase, Arkansas Best entered into a $100 million secured term loan facility with a syndicate of banks to finance a portion of the transaction.  The balance of the proceeds needed to pay the full purchase price and transaction costs was funded out of Arkansas Best's available cash.
 
Changes in the accompanying Arkansas Best consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 include $230 million of acquired assets and $49 million of liabilities, primarily deferred tax liabilities.  Additional details of these preliminary fair value assessments are included in the financial tables section of this press release.
 
 
Closing Comments
 
"Arkansas Best is focused on listening to our customers and providing solutions that meet their needs," said Ms. McReynolds.  "The addition of Panther and the investments we are making in our other non-asset-based subsidiaries will further that objective and improve our opportunities to grow our relationships and our company.  Our efforts to lower ABF's cost structure will continue until we find the right solution."
 
Conference Call

Forward-Looking Statements
 
The following is a "safe harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
Statements contained in this report that are not based on historical facts are "forward-looking statements." Terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "plan," "predict," "prospects," "scheduled," "should," "would," and similar expressions and the negatives of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
 
Such statements are by their nature subject to uncertainties and risk including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and related shifts in market demand that impact the performance and needs of industries served by Arkansas Best Corporation's subsidiaries and limit our customers' access to adequate financial resources; the successful integration of Panther; relationships with employees, including unions; union and nonunion employee wages and benefits, including changes in required contributions to multiemployer pension plans; competitive initiatives, pricing pressures, the effect of volatility in fuel prices and the associated changes in fuel surcharges on securing increases in base freight rates and the inability to collect fuel surcharges; availability of fuel; availability and cost of reliable third-party services; the timing and amount of capital expenditures; future costs of operating expenses such as fuel and related taxes; self-insurance claims and insurance premium costs; governmental regulations and policies; future climate change legislation; availability and cost of capital and financing arrangements; the cost and timing of growth initiatives; the impact of our brand and corporate reputation; the cost, integration, and performance of any future acquisitions; costs of continuing investments in technology and the impact of cyber incidents; weather conditions; and other financial, operational, and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Arkansas Best Corporation's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") public filings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results. Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as EBITDA is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations. However, these financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, operating cash flow, net income or earnings per share, as defined by GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore the Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. As Panther's net income is not presented, EBITDA has been reconciled to operating income, which is the reported GAAP measure.
 
On June 15, 2012, Arkansas Best completed the acquisition of Panther Expedited Services, Inc.  The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities for Panther.
 
 
The above purchase price allocation was based on preliminary information regarding the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities for Panther and the amount of goodwill recognized as of June 15, 2012. With the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, Arkansas Best is conducting an assessment of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities for Panther and the amount of goodwill recognized as of June 15, 2012. This assessment requires a significant amount of judgment, and Arkansas Best has not completed this analysis as it relates to the valuation of Panther. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, amortization of intangible assets, including software, is estimated to total approximately $8 million per year.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Fort Smith, Arkansas, August 1, 2012  ABF Freight System, Inc., one of the nation's largest less-than-truckload carriers, on Wednesday said it disagrees with, and is disappointed by, today's District Court ruling dismissing its lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other parties for violations of the National Master Freight Agreement.
 
On August 1, 2012, Judge Susan Webber Wright of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas entered an order dismissing the case brought by Arkansas Best Corporation's (Nasdaq: ABFS) largest subsidiary, ABF, without prejudice.  This case was originally filed on November 1, 2010, against the IBT and other parties including several YRC Worldwide subsidiaries for violations of the collective bargaining agreement covering most unionized trucking employees in the country.  Previous to today's ruling, Judge Wright had dismissed the case but that dismissal was later reversed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  ABF is studying the ruling and evaluating its options which include, among other avenues, taking a second appeal to the Eighth Circuit or refiling the case in the District Court.

ITEM 7.01  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) (the "Company") is providing the following update on the most recent information related to the Company's third quarter 2012 financial results and business trends. ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF") is the largest subsidiary of the Company.
 
ABF's financial metrics and business trends for third quarter 2012 to-date, through August 31, 2012, versus the same period last year:
 
                 
Billed revenue decreased approximately one half percent (0.5%)
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight increased approximately 2%
                 
Tonnage per day decreased approximately 2%
 
Based on projected operating results through August 2012, the Company does not expect ABF's third quarter 2012 operating ratio to be improved compared to second quarter 2012.  In recent years, ABF's operating ratio trend between second quarter and third quarter averaged an improvement of 1.6 points.
 
The Company attributes the decline in business trends and expected operating results to a weakening economic environment, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  ABF's sequential percentage change in total tonnage per day from July 2012 to August 2012 was weaker than historical averages.
 
The following is a "safe harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

The press release contains reconciliations of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding the Company's results of operations because they provide meaningful comparisons between current and prior results. The press release also contains calculations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
                 
Net income of $6.5 million
                 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.24
                 
Panther Expedited Services enhances corporate service opportunities
                 
ABF labor contract negotiations to begin in December
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, November 1, 2012)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced third quarter 2012 net income of $6.5 million, or $0.24 per share, compared with net income of $12.3 million, or $0.46 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
 
"Arkansas Best's results reflect weakness in the economy that contributed to reduced customer business levels and lower profitability at ABF.  The slowing business environment also reduced the demand for expedited services at Panther," said Arkansas Best President and CEO Judy R. McReynolds.  "However, at our emerging non-asset-based companies, we are encouraged by the continuation of strong revenue and improving profitability trends in the midst of a tenuous economy."
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
During the 2012 third quarter, business levels at ABF were below the same period last year by 1.4 percent.  "This drop reflects the current, soft economic environment as well as the remaining effects of business declines resulting from pricing actions ABF implemented throughout most of last year and into the first quarter of this year," said Ms. McReynolds.  "Industry pricing is stable and rational, consistent with ABF's third quarter 2012 experience.  ABF's recent yield improvement reflects positive retention of the late June general rate increase and better price levels on contractual agreements that renewed during the quarter.  ABF has added new, profitable customer relationships and remains focused on improving existing account pricing and managing its resources to available freight levels."
 
Throughout the third quarter, ABF experienced cost pressures whose unfavorable margin effects were amplified by the decline in quarterly revenue.  The most significant costs affecting ABF are associated with our union labor contract.  In addition, nonunion benefit costs were impacted by previously discussed increases in 2012 pension and retirement costs as well as a greater than expected increase in employee health care costs during the first two months of the quarter.  Purchased transportation costs increased due to a greater need for these services, both domestically and internationally, combined with higher rates charged by these service providers.  Finally, as previously reported, equipment depreciation costs are higher, on a year-over-year basis, because of the timing and increased cost of new tractor and trailer replacements during the last twelve months.
 
 "For some time now, we have remained diligent in our efforts to address ABF's high cost structure.  This includes numerous internal activities associated with the March 2013 expiration of ABF's union labor contract," said Ms. McReynolds.  "As previously announced, we expect to begin negotiations with the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee, the negotiating arm of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on December 18.  ABF's next labor agreement offers an opportunity for us to work together with the Teamsters and our employees to ensure that ABF is viable in the marketplace and able to grow jobs and effectively compete for additional, profitable business."
 
Panther Expedited Services, Inc.
 
 "As we complete the first full quarter of having our premium logistics provider Panther Expedited Services, Inc. as a subsidiary, we are excited about the long-term growth possibilities it offers our company.  We have identified opportunities for Panther to work together with our other subsidiaries to better serve customers, with a number of these opportunities already yielding positive benefits.  Moving forward, we believe the addition of Panther will be a key element in our development into a comprehensive logistics resource for our customers," said Ms. McReynolds.
 
"Third quarter results at Panther were impacted by a slower macroeconomic environment, both domestically and internationally.  Though total customer loads increased, the availability of business within the industries Panther serves varied.  The reduction in revenue per mile associated with changes in business mix had an unfavorable impact on Panther's profit margin."
 
 
Other Non-Asset-Based Subsidiaries
 
Arkansas Best's emerging non-asset-based subsidiaries experienced revenue growth and operating income improvement throughout the quarter in spite of weaker macroeconomic factors.  The freight brokerage and emergency and preventative maintenance segments benefitted from new customer relationships that translated into additional business opportunities, with these segments growing revenues by 63% and 32%, respectively.  However, profit margins in these segments continued to be impacted by investments previously made in personnel and information technology.  As the benefits of those investments are fully realized, these subsidiaries will provide a platform for enhancing the logistics services Arkansas Best offers its customers.  This enables further penetration into the $200 billion portion of the transportation market the company now serves.  With the addition of Panther, Arkansas Best's non-asset-based businesses generated over 20% of third quarter consolidated revenues.
 
Capital Expenditures Update
 
Because of reduced business levels and improved network utilization ABF plans to reduce this year's new tractor replacements by eight percent.  This ABF change contributes to Arkansas Best's expected 2012 net capital expenditure total of approximately $75 million.  Earlier in the year the range of expected 2012 net capital expenditures was between $80 and $90 million.
 
Closing Comments
 
"The uncertain economic environment has impacted our recent performance and presents challenges in the near term," said Ms. McReynolds.  "However, we believe our company is better equipped for future success because of the combination of logistics services we now offer the marketplace.  As we seek to reduce ABF's cost structure as well as improve the flexibility of its network, the additional resources available within our company provide opportunities for solidifying existing customer relationships and gaining new business."

RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results. Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as EBITDA is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations. However, these financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, operating cash flow, net income or earnings per share, as defined by GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore the Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

ABF's financial metrics and business trends for fourth quarter 2012 to-date, through November 11, 2012, versus the same period last year:
 
                 
Billed revenue decreased approximately 1%

Exhibit 99.1
 
CONTRACT STRAIGHT TALK                                     December 21, 2012
 
ABF on December 19 exchanged initial contract proposals with the Teamsters. Our proposal is all about serving our customers better and quickly adapting to rapid changes in the marketplace. We are looking out for our employees' long-term best interests, as it is our goal to take back market share and reverse the trend of job loss at ABF in an era when most union LTL carriers have gone out of business.
 
It is true that our proposal is different from the National Master Freight Agreement (NMFA), because the marketplace is also vastly different and demands new solutions and greater flexibility for ABF.  The NMFA is an outdated, 1965 agreement that covered virtually the entire trucking industry, which was then largely unionized.  Now, non-union companies dominate.  ABF has survived despite this trend because we have embraced change when it is needed, as it is greatly needed now.
 
The facts are that ABF is the only employer left currently paying full contract rates under the NMFA for wages, health & welfare and pension contributions.  In our proposal we are only asking to be brought in line with the types of accommodations and cost structures the Teamsters have agreed to with our competitors.
 
ABF has proposed a single comprehensive national contract that would eliminate separate supplemental documents.  A national LTL provider needs uniformity in time-off benefits, scheduling, dispatching and other work rules to ensure that regional and national networks can meet customers' demands for flexible on-time performance at a reasonable price. UPS Freight, for example, has a national single-employer contract with the Teamsters with no supplements.
 
Initially, we are seeking in our proposal to reduce inefficiencies throughout the system in an effort to minimize the negative financial impact on our current union employees. We have used a thoughtful and surgical approach to accomplish this, rather than "meat-axe" methods used by others to cut costs when solutions were delayed until it was too late.
 
Our non-union employees, which represent about a quarter of Arkansas Best's total workforce, have already made significant sacrifices totaling $85 million since 2008, while our Teamster-represented employees have continued to see wage and benefit increases in the same time period.  In fact, even with the Central States freeze in the last two years, our pension costs have escalated 40% since the 2008 NMFA was signed and are now 14 times that of non-union competitors, and two to three times higher than all other LTL carriers with Teamster contracts.
 
This isn't sustainable. The proposal put forth by the Teamsters will not protect jobs and retirements or allow ABF to grow, but instead will have the opposite effect by putting us in an even deeper financial hole than we are in now, having racked up $230 million in losses since 2009. Additionally, a two-year agreement that would sync us back up with YRCW simply is not in the best interest of ABF employees.
 
We know we can serve customers better if we have a better contract, allowing us to take back market share and add jobs. We must seize the opportunity now to show that the Teamsters and ABF can work together to allow ABF to become much more competitive, thereby enhancing the job and retirement security of our past, present and future employees.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
                 
Fourth quarter 2012 net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.31 per share, including $2.4 million, or $0.09 per share, related to an increase in workers' compensation expense
                 
Emerging, non-asset-based businesses profitable on gains that produced record fourth quarter revenues
                 
ABF contract negotiations underway with goal to cut costs and restore profitability
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, January 30, 2013)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today announced unaudited results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Arkansas Best had a fourth quarter 2012 net loss, as generally flat, year-over-year revenue, tonnage and pricing at ABF Freight System, Inc. were offset by higher costs. For the same period, Arkansas Best's emerging, non-asset-based businesses were profitable and posted higher revenues.  Arkansas Best's fourth quarter 2012 revenue was $537.0 million compared to revenue of $463.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 
Following the acquisition of Panther Expedited Services, Inc. in June 2012, Arkansas Best saw yearly revenue top $2 billion for the first time in its history. In addition to Panther, Arkansas Best's emerging, non-asset-based businesses that contributed to 2012's revenue growth are in freight brokerage, and vehicle roadside and preventative maintenance.
 
Arkansas Best's fourth quarter 2012 net loss was $7.9 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2011 net income of $1.4 million, or $0.05 per share. This quarter's results include an after-tax charge of $2.4 million, or $0.09 per share, related to an actuarial adjustment to ABF's workers' compensation expense.  The liabilities associated with Arkansas Best's self-insured portion of these costs are estimates based on a number of variables and assumptions.  During the fourth quarter, information indicating that many of these claims had a
 
longer duration and higher payments than initially projected resulted in a thorough actuarial review and in this adjustment.
 
For full year 2012, Arkansas Best had a net loss of $7.7 million, or $0.31 per share, including the previously discussed workers' compensation expense increase.  This compares to net income of $6.2 million, or $0.23 per share, in 2011.  Arkansas Best's full year 2012 revenue was $2.1 billion compared to revenue of $1.9 billion in 2011.
 
"We are pleased with revenue growth and improving profitability at our emerging businesses as they added up to more than 20 percent of our total company fourth quarter revenue," said Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer Judy R. McReynolds. "Expanding our portfolio of expedited and premium logistics services was a major initiative in 2012 as our customers' supply chains grow ever more complex.  We are encouraged by the trends we have seen in these businesses. Among other things, we added key sales and customer service personnel and invested in service-enhancing technologies, all of which were well-received in the marketplace."
 
McReynolds added that the full-year loss at ABF resulting in a 2012 operating ratio above 100, following a slightly profitable 2011, was troubling as total revenues remained about even with annual yield improvement offset by lower business levels. "We are focused on a return to profitability at ABF by substantially lowering our costs in the next labor contract through negotiations that are now underway. ABF's management team is hopeful it will reach an agreement with the Teamsters that allows us to preserve good-paying jobs and protect our employees' retirements through a lower cost structure that truly reflects the competitive nature of today's LTL marketplace."
 
In late December, ABF exchanged initial contract proposals with the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee. ABF seeks a national contract that eliminates the use of supplements and provides uniform terms for all of its local operations throughout the country. While previous versions of the National Master Freight Agreement ("NMFA") once covered more than 500,000 Teamsters, today, ABF is negotiating for its own contract that will cover 7,500 union employees. ABF is the only remaining union LTL carrier still paying full NMFA rates. Without significant reduction to this burdensome cost structure, ABF has informed Teamster leadership that extensive network changes will result, including closure of terminals and distribution centers.
 
ABF Freight System, Inc.
 
ABF's fourth quarter 2012 total daily tonnage and pricing statistics saw little change compared to last year's fourth quarter, leading to flat revenue as shippers maintained low inventory levels. At the same time, costs rose due to union labor contract wage and benefit increases that occurred earlier in the year and because of a lack of operational flexibility. In addition, higher depreciation costs associated with more expensive capital equipment and higher workers' compensation expense contributed to ABF's losses.
 
In late October, the impact of Hurricane Sandy resulted in lost revenue and profit opportunities along with returned shipments that had to be re-handled and re-delivered as customers closed for business in the days following the storm.  This resulted in estimated lost revenue of $2  $2.5 million, an increase of about 0.4 percentage points in ABF's operating ratio and a reduction of $0.04 per share on Arkansas Best's fourth quarter results.
 
During the fourth quarter, changes in ABF's freight profile and account mix caused total pricing statistics to be the same as last year.  However, when adjusted for fuel surcharge and these profile and account changes, ABF's fourth quarter pricing on its traditional LTL business increased more than 2.5 percent versus last year.  Throughout 2012, pricing among carriers in the LTL industry was consistent and stable.  For the full year, ABF made steady progress in improving its account yield levels by 4.4 percent compared to 2011."

Operating loss of $13.6 million, including $3.8 million related to an increase in workers' compensation expense, compared to operating income of $1.3 million in fourth quarter 2011
                 
Operating ratio of 103.2%, including 0.9% related to an increase in workers' compensation expense, compared to an operating ratio of 99.7% in fourth quarter 2011
 
Full Year 2012
 
                 
Revenue of $1.73 billion, the same as in 2011
                 
Tonnage per day decrease of 4.6% versus 2011
                 
Total billed revenue per hundredweight of $28.03 compared to $26.86 in 2011, an increase of 4.4%

Operating ratio of 101.1%, including 0.2% related to an increase in workers' compensation expense, compared to an operating ratio of 99.8% in 2011
 
Emerging Businesses
 
Panther Expedited Services, Inc. is an important component of Arkansas Best's strategic goal of being an integrated logistics solutions provider. During the fourth quarter, Panther's revenue increased to record fourth quarter levels, and cash flow generation remained strong despite mixed results in the various market segments.  Particularly in the government business segment, Panther was affected by a lack of commitment of many of its customers to invest in their businesses due to uncertainty in the economy.  A slowdown in industrial production and tighter inventory management also resulted in fewer available manufacturing-related shipments.
 
Arkansas Best's other emerging non-asset-based subsidiaries experienced revenue growth and operating income improvement throughout the quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. The freight brokerage segment grew revenue by 91%, achieving the highest quarterly revenue in its history.  The emergency and preventative maintenance segment achieved revenue growth of 39%, producing the second highest quarterly revenue in its history.  Fourth quarter profits in these two operating segments increased nearly two to three times compared to the same period last year.  The benefits of investments previously made in sales, customer service, and information technology at these companies are contributing to increased revenues and improving profitability.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
In 2012, ABF's total net capital expenditures equated to $69 million, including approximately $49 million of revenue equipment.  Depreciation and amortization costs equaled $85 million.
 
Because ABF's union labor negotiations are in progress and planning for 2013 is highly dependent on the outcome of contract negotiations, ABF's 2013 net capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization costs have not been estimated.  In the next few months, as more clarity is gained on potential costs savings associated with ABF's new labor contract, estimates on capital expenditures and depreciation will be provided.
 
Closing Comments
 
"There continue to be many questions about the economy and its impact on the transport markets in which we compete.  Most economists are predicting a low level of growth in 2013," said McReynolds. "Looking ahead, we recognize that ABF and all of our other subsidiaries must generate profits regardless of the economic climate.  We are hopeful that our ongoing ABF contract negotiations will result in the right cost structure and greater operational flexibility, but our game plan for success at Arkansas Best takes into account all potential outcomes. Thanks to our expanding portfolio of diverse companies that are better able to meet customers' needs in a changing marketplace, we will continue to execute on our overarching goal to keep Arkansas Best firmly on a path toward financial success that rewards our shareholders."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results. Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as EBITDA is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations. However, these financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, operating cash flow, net income or earnings per share, as defined by GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore the Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Following the conclusion of last week's round of negotiations in Kansas City, ABF is pleased to report progress on various operational flexibility issues that will allow us to better serve our customers in a marketplace that continues to undergo significant change. Through hard bargaining on both sides of the table, we are comprehensively addressing the first set of substantive issues on various operational needs to help ABF better compete. Work on those operational issues continues and we look forward to continued discussions in the coming weeks on specific economic terms that remain.
 
Based upon the current state of negotiations and progress that has been made so far, ABF expects that good faith negotiations could, if necessary, continue  as required by federal labor law  beyond March 31, when the current collective bargaining agreement expires. The company anticipates that an extension would be possible as long as the two sides continue to make progress at the negotiating table. It is important to note that in this circumstance, the existing superior wages and benefits enjoyed by ABF Teamster employees would remain in place during the extension period.
 
In this process, we seek to appropriately lower our cost structure and better serve customers while still maintaining some of the best jobs in the LTL industry and protecting our employees' retirements. We wish to thank our dedicated employees for their continued hard work and outstanding service to our customers while this important process continues.
 
We will provide additional updates as negotiations continue and wish to assure all of our customers that ABF's employees will continue to deliver the highest quality of service that our customers have come to expect. Negotiations resume in Kansas City the week of March 11.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ABF and Teamster bargaining teams have agreed to another extension of the contract through the end of May. Our goal is to return ABF to profitability, which will preserve jobs and retirements while still providing the best wage and benefits package in the industry. We must ensure ABF's long-term viability with a contract that reflects how the rest of the industry operates. We can't continue with the contract that produced $250 million in losses since 2009.
 
The initial economic proposals we offered to the Teamsters this week align with that goal. While some compensation adjustments are necessary, it is important for our employees to recognize that our proposal will still provide them the best compensation package in the industry, certainly better than any alternative position they could get at another freight company and significantly better than our largest Teamster competitor, YRC. And we are not asking our union employees to do anything that our non-union employees have not already done.
 
The Teamsters have recognized publicly that ABF needs relief. We have taken a balanced approach to the negotiations and have specifically avoided proposing the meat-axe wage and benefit cuts that our competitors have been forced to adopt. Our goal has been to achieve the bulk of the cost reductions through changes in work rules and flexibility, but there is more to do.
 
We value our employees greatly and know from history that their interests are best served by a return to consistent profitability. As we continue to negotiate in the coming weeks, we remind our employees that our goal is to preserve their jobs and retirements, while still providing a wage and benefits package that is the best in the industry.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Following Friday's announcement of another 30-day contract extension to allow for continuing contract discussions, misperceptions about our pension proposals have been circulating and must be corrected.
 
Our goal is to stay in every pension fund and ensure ABF's long-term viability in order to continue contributing to the funds. We pay money into 25 different multiemployer pension funds. Nearly two-thirds of our Teamster employees are enrolled in plans that are currently in the "critical" or "endangered" zone. Withdrawal from the pension plans would expose ABF to potentially significant withdrawal liability, which would be counterproductive to our efforts to better align our costs with our competitors.
 
The terms of our initial proposal include pension payments that we believe are sufficient to allow the continued participation of our employees in each of the current 25 pension plans, including the Western Conference pension plan. It is not our intention, nor do we envision any scenario that would result in our withdrawal from any fund in which we are currently participating.
 
As we have said throughout the course of the negotiations, here are our goals:
 
1.  To maintain the best-paying jobs in the freight industry.
 
2.  To stay in our current pension funds.

Press release of Arkansas Best Corporation dated April 30, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
                 
Revenue rises to $520.7 million from $440.9 million
                 
First quarter 2013 net loss of $13.4 million, or $0.52 per share
                 
Emerging, non-asset-based businesses continue growth trends and cash generation
                 
ABF labor contract negotiations continue and remain important to lowering ABF's cost structure
 
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, April 30, 2013)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) today reported a first quarter 2013 net loss despite continued encouraging trends in its emerging businesses.  Year-over-year revenue and tonnage growth at LTL carrier ABF Freight System, Inc., were offset by higher wage and benefit costs for employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
 
Arkansas Best's first quarter 2013 revenue was $520.7 million compared to revenue of $440.9 million in the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter net loss was $13.4 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to a first quarter 2012 net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.71 per share.  Last year's first quarter results included the effects of an unusually low corporate tax benefit rate and unusually high workers' compensation claims costs.  Combined, these items increased last year's first quarter net loss by $0.31 per share.
 
Arkansas Best's emerging, non-asset-based businesses continue to display strength in their revenue growth and cash flow generation.  Freight brokerage and vehicle roadside and preventive maintenance grew first-quarter revenue 82% and 45%, respectively, and improved operating income. Operating results at Panther Expedited Services, Inc., were impacted by reduced demand for expedited services and investments made in sales and service locations for future growth.  On a combined basis, Panther and all of the other non-asset-based businesses generated first quarter 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $3.4 million, versus slightly negative EBITDA in the first quarter of 2012.
 
"First quarter revenue and operating income at our emerging businesses reflected growth and improvement as we invested heavily in these businesses during 2012.  They represent a critical piece of Arkansas Best's strategy to achieve sustained profitability," said Arkansas Best President and Chief Executive Officer Judy R. McReynolds.  "The investments made so far have improved the financial performance of these subsidiaries and strengthened their service offerings and their ability, both individually and through significant cross-selling opportunities, to better serve customers with full supply-chain solutions."
 
ABF Freight's first-quarter operating loss deepened despite revenue growth and improving business levels. McReynolds noted that the company's high-cost structure continues to weigh on results, underscoring the need for a more rational labor agreement that reflects the increasingly competitive LTL industry. "After months of hard work and a second extension of contract talks through May 31, the negotiating teams continue to make progress on developing a contract agreement for our Teamster-represented employees that is expected to provide ABF greater operational flexibility and lower costs in order to effectively compete in the future."
 
Closing Comments
 
"Despite losses in the seasonally weak first quarter, Arkansas Best is well-positioned for growth in new and existing markets.  We continue to develop a comprehensive array of services designed to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and generate financial returns for our company and our shareholders," said McReynolds.  "Current negotiations on a new labor agreement provide an opportunity to preserve good-paying jobs and protect the retirement benefits of our union employees through a lower cost structure and improved operational flexibility.  A new labor contract, with lower more competitive costs, is a critical element in allowing ABF to effectively compete in a drastically different LTL marketplace."
 
Conference Call
 
Arkansas Best Corporation will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2013 first quarter results.  The call will be today, Tuesday, April 30, at 9:30 a.m. ET (8:30 a.m. CT).  Interested parties are invited to listen by calling (800) 659-2165.  Following the call, a recorded playback will be available through the end of the day on May 31, 2013.

Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of amortization of intangibles, including customer relationships and software, which were acquired in conjunction with the purchase of Panther Expedited Services, Inc. on June 15, 2012.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends.  Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results. Management believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as EBITDA is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure financial performance and ability to service debt obligations. However, these financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, operating cash flow, net income or earnings per share, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently, and therefore the Company's EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Exhibit 99.1
(Fort Smith, Arkansas, May17, 2013)  Arkansas Best Corporation (Nasdaq: ABFS) announced today that it has adopted changes to its nonunion defined benefit pension plan ("the Plan").  The changes affect all active Plan participants including all management executives who are participants. The change is being made to reduce the ongoing costs, including administrative and regulatory costs, associated with the Plan.
 
Effective July 1, 2013, the Plan will be frozen with the result that the accrual of future benefits under the Plan will stop.  Retirement benefits earned by participants through June 30, 2013 will be preserved. In accordance with legal requirements applicable to pensions, the Plan changes will not impact the vested pension benefits of retirees or former employees. Active employees participating in the Plan will become eligible for the discretionary defined contribution plan effective July 1, 2013.
 
While the precise amount of net savings resulting from the changes to the Plan and participation in the discretionary defined contribution plan cannot be determined at this time, Arkansas Best expects that the reduction in this expense will be material going forward.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
May 29, 2013
 
ABF Freight System, Inc. and the Teamsters have reached another extension on the current labor agreement until June 30, 2013, while the ratification process on the next five-year contract is underway. Ballots will be mailed to Teamster-represented employees on June 3, and the votes are expected to be counted on or around June 27.
 
While the ratification process continues, it is business as usual at ABF, and we thank our customers and employees for their ongoing support.
 
We believe that the contract proposal that will soon be voted on by our employees represents the best opportunity to return the company to profitability, while preserving some of the best jobs in the industry. The agreement maintains all health, welfare and pension benefits and provides for wages that will be higher at the end of the agreement than current rates.
