EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  March 11, 2004  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a leading provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003.
J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our operating performance. Our 2003 net operating income of over $329 million represents the best year in our 25-year history. This performance demonstrates the merits of our diversified market approach and proven strategy of building leading specialty insurance businesses."
Assurant reported 2003 net income of $185.7 million, or $1.30 per pro forma diluted share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release). This compares to 2002 net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $259.7 million, or $1.83 per pro forma diluted share. Per share calculations are based on 142,268,106 shares currently outstanding.
Assurant reported 2003 net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) of $329.2 million, or $2.31 per pro forma diluted share, compared to 2002 net operating income of $327.0 million, or $2.30 per pro forma diluted share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, IPO related expenses, and interest premium on redemption of preferred securities of subsidiary trusts.
For the fourth quarter of 2003, Assurant reported a net loss of ($77.6) million, or ($0.55) per pro forma diluted share, versus net income of $60.4 million, or $0.42 per pro forma diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Assurant reported net operating income for the most recent quarter of $74.8 million, or $0.53 per pro forma diluted share, versus net operating income for the year-ago quarter of $77.3 million, or $0.54 per pro forma diluted share.
Net earned premiums in 2003 grew 8.4% to $6.2 billion from $5.7 billion in 2002. This was driven by growth in Assurant's two largest segments, Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health.
Net investment income in the most recent year decreased 3.9% to $607.3 million from $631.8 million in 2002, as the yield on average invested assets decreased to 5.61% in 2003 from 6.20% in 2002 due to the low interest rate environment. Total invested assets increased 11.1% to $11.9 billion in 2003 from $10.7 billion in 2002.
 
Fourth quarter 2003 net earned premiums grew 10.8% to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net investment income in the most recent quarter decreased 5.5% to $150.7 million from $159.5 million in the same quarter last year.
Reconciliation of net operating income to net income
"Having completed our IPO on February 5th, we are looking forward to our first year as an independent public company with confidence," said Mr. Clayton. "Our business model is strong and we are well capitalized to take advantage of an improving economic climate for many of our product lines. We will maintain our focus on specialty insurance markets and we will continue to emphasize profitability by leveraging our unique capabilities  disciplined risk management, complex administration and system skills, and strong distribution relationships with market leaders."
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions 2003 net operating income was $133.2 million, up slightly from 2002 net operating income of $132.2 million. Fourth quarter 2003 net operating income of $33.1 million grew 4.7% from $31.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Assurant Solutions 2003 net earned premiums grew 13.7% to $2.4 billion from $2.1 billion in 2002. Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter 2003 grew 10.9% to $625.0 million from $563.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Net operating income increased modestly despite higher catastrophe losses, including those related to the California wildfires and Hurricane Isabel, lower investment income as a result of the low interest rate environment, and increased expenses related to the growth in new business. Assurant Solutions premium growth for the full year and fourth quarter 2003 was due to growth in the specialty property and extended service contracts product lines.
 
Assurant Health
Assurant Health 2003 net operating income grew 28.1% to $121.0 million from $94.4 million in 2002. Net operating income for the fourth quarter 2003 grew 46.4% to $28.4 million from $19.4 million in the year-ago quarter.
Assurant Health 2003 net earned premiums grew 9.6% to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion in 2002. Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter of 2003 grew 14.0% to $533.7 million from $468.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Improved profitability in 2003 and in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to premium growth in individual medical and to improved benefit loss ratios. Assurant Health membership at the end of 2003 totaled 1.137 million, an increase of about 11% from membership of 1.025 million at the end of 2002.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits 2003 net operating income increased 7.9% to $61.6 million from $57.1 million in 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 net operating income decreased 35.8% to $12.9 million from $20.1 million in the same period in 2002.
Assurant Employee Benefits 2003 net earned premiums grew 1.9% to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in 2002. Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter of 2003 grew 10.8% to $336.1 million from $303.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Net operating income for 2003 reflected the results of a reserve adequacy study conducted in the third quarter that resulted in a net reduction in reserves of approximately $12 million after-tax. 2003 results were adversely affected by lower net investment income. Underlying experience in 2003 improved in disability, remained the same in dental, and worsened in group life compared to 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 results were in line with the first three quarters, adjusting for the reserve reduction. In 2003, management's focus on maintaining underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive environment resulted in a reduction of new business sales.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed 2003 net operating income declined 27.5% to $36.0 million from $49.7 million in 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 net operating income decreased 24.4% to $8.2 million from $10.8 million in the same period of 2002.
Assurant Preneed 2003 net earned premiums decreased 1.6% to $529.3 million from $537.7 million in 2002. Assurant Preneed fourth quarter 2003 net earned premiums decreased 0.6% to $128.4 million from $129.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Net operating income for the year and fourth quarter 2003 decreased mainly due to lower spreads between investment yields generated by the investment portfolio and rates credited on reserves. Management has lowered crediting rates on new business and in-force blocks of business that it has the ability to adjust and has taken cost cutting
 
initiatives. The decrease in net earned premiums for the year and fourth quarter 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in sales from a major distributor.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined in accordance with a predetermined amortization schedule. Interest expense and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased slightly in the fourth quarter due to the company's recent redemption of preferred securities.
Financial Position
Total assets at December 31, 2003 were $23.7 billion, up from $22.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Prior to the initial public offering, the company repaid the remaining mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. In the weeks following the IPO the company received a capital contribution of $725 million from Fortis and issued $975 million of senior notes to repay the $1.75 billion of short-term loans outstanding. This was consistent with the company's capital planning objectives.
Cash and cash equivalents and total invested assets were $11.9 billion at the end of 2003, versus $10.7 billion at the end of 2002. In 2003, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $1.2 million compared to net realized after-tax losses of $77.0 million in 2002. In 2003, Assurant recorded other than temporary impairments of $13.2 million after-tax compared to $55.4 million after-tax in 2002.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our final prospectus dated February 4, 2004, as filed with the SEC on February 5, 2004.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. The restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants, resulting in total outstanding shares of 142,268,106. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments and the after-tax effect of other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Assurant Reports Q1 2004 Net Operating Income of $87.5 Million ($0.62 Per Proforma Share), An Increase Of 14% Over 2003; Net Income Of $94.4 Million ($0.66 Per Proforma Share), An Increase Of 29% Over 2003
New York  May 12, 2004  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a leading provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004.
J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Assurant had a very good quarter. Our specialized insurance model delivered net operating income of $87.5 million, up 14% over a year ago. Our results were driven by strong performance in our three largest businesses. We remain focused on generating profitable growth from our market-leading niche products in 2004."
Net income in the first quarter of 2004 grew 29% to $94.4 million, or $0.66 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release), compared to first quarter 2003 net income of $73.2 million, or $0.51 per pro forma share. Pro forma per share calculations are based on 142,208,676 shares currently outstanding.
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the first quarter of 2004 grew 14% to $87.5 million, or $0.62 per pro forma share, compared to first quarter 2003 net operating income of $76.5 million, or $0.54 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual and/or infrequent items.
Net earned premiums in the first quarter of 2004 grew 8% to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion for the same period in 2003. Assurant's two largest segments, Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health, drove net earned premium growth.
Net investment income in the first quarter of 2004 increased slightly to $153.8 million from $151.5 million in the first quarter of 2003. The annualized yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.43% in the first quarter of 2004 compared to 5.85% in the first quarter of 2003. The lower yield was offset by higher invested assets.
 
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions net operating income in the first quarter of 2004 increased 15.7% to $40.1 million, from net operating income of $34.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net operating income increased due to premium growth and a favorable combined ratio.
Assurant Solutions net earned premiums in the first quarter 2004 increased 9.0% to $623.1 million from $571.5 million in the first quarter of 2003. The increase in net earned premiums was due primarily to growth in the warranty and extended service contract products in the consumer protection business and growth in the specialty property solutions business.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health net operating income grew 16.4% in the first quarter of 2004 to $36.7 million from $31.5 million in the first quarter of 2003. The increase in net operating income is primarily due to premium and membership growth in the individual product line.
 
Assurant Health net earned premiums in the first quarter of 2004 grew 15.5% to $550.9 million from $477.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. The increase in net earned premium is attributable to continued strong growth in individual insurance and continued steady growth in small group. New Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) contributed to growth in individual membership.
Assurant Health membership at March 31, 2004 totaled 1.16 million, an increase of 11.6% from 1.04 million at March 31, 2003.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2004 net operating income increased 62.8% to $13.2 million from $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net operating income improvement was driven by better loss ratios in the Group Life and Disability product lines and by an overall improvement in expense ratio.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2004 net earned premiums were $318.0 million, compared to $320.3 million in the first quarter of 2003.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2004 net operating income declined 29.3% to $6.5 million from $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net operating income decreased mainly due to continued low new money rates and flat sales.
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2004 net earned premiums were $133.2 million, compared to $134.0 million in the first quarter of 2003.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the run-off of these businesses. Interest expense and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in the first quarter of 2004 declined by $11.2 million after-tax compared to the first quarter of 2003 as a result of a lower level of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2004 was ($10.4) million, primarily due to public company expenses and lower investment income.
Financial Position
At March 31, 2004 total assets were $23.7 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $11.9 billion. In the first quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $9.2 million compared to net realized after-tax losses of ($3.3) million in the first quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, Assurant recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $0.5 million after-tax compared to $7.6 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2003.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, which can be accessed from the Assurant website at www.Assurant.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital
 
contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares), resulting in total outstanding shares of 142,208,676. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.73 for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $0.67 for the first quarter of 2003. GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share calculations are based upon 129,521,299 weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2004 and 109,222,276 weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2003.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments and the after-tax effect of other unusual and/or infrequent items.

Safe Harbor Statement:
Some of the statements included in this statistical supplement, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, which can be accessed on the Assurant website at www.assurant.com.
 
  
Regulation G
Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments and the after-tax effect of other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. The restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of common stock to Fortis in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million; and the issuance of 68,976 shares of common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares), resulting in total outstanding shares of 142,208,676. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. Book value per share excluding AOCI, equals stockholders' equity, less the after-tax effect of unrealized gains/(losses) on investments, foreign currency translation and pension underfunding, divided by common shares outstanding. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro Forma book value per share and Pro Forma book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. The restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of common stock to Fortis in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million; and the issuance of 68,976 shares of common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares), resulting in total outstanding shares of 142,208,676. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measure, book value per share.

J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Our diversified specialty insurance platform continues to deliver very good results. Net operating income for the second quarter increased 18% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by continued strong performances in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health."
Second Quarter Results:
Net income in the second quarter of 2004 grew 5.0% to $95.2 million, or $0.67 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release), versus second quarter 2003 net income of $90.7 million, or $0.64 per pro forma share.
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the second quarter of 2004 grew 18.5% to $97.8 million, or $0.69 per pro forma share, compared to second quarter 2003 net operating income of $82.6 million, or $0.58 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, loss on disposal of business and IPO related expenses.
Net earned premiums in the second quarter of 2004 grew 8.9% to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion for the same period in 2003. Assurant's two largest segments, Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health, continued to drive net earned premium growth.
Net investment income in the second quarter of 2004 increased to $157.6 million from $154.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.57% in the second quarter of 2004, compared to 5.92% in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Six-Month Results:
Net income in the first half of 2004 grew 15.7% to $189.6 million, or $1.33 per pro forma share, versus first half 2003 net income of $163.9 million, or $1.15 per pro forma share.
Net operating income for the first half of 2004 grew 16.5% to $185.3 million, or $1.30 per pro forma share, compared to first half 2003 net operating income of $159.0 million, or $1.12 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, loss on disposal of business and IPO-related expenses.
Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 grew 8.5% to $3.2 billion from $3.0 billion for the same period in 2003.
Net investment income in the first half of 2004 increased to $311.5 million from $305.9 million in the first half of 2003. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.49% for the first six months of 2004, compared to 5.91% for the first half of 2003.
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2004 net operating income was $38.6 million, up 13.2% from second quarter 2003 net operating income of $34.1 million. First half 2004 net operating income of $78.6 million grew 14.5% from $68.7 million in the first half of 2003. Net operating income for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 increased due to growth in net earned premiums and improved loss experience, primarily as a result of lower catastrophe activity versus the second quarter and first six months of 2003.
 
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 10.5% to $610.6 million from $552.4 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 grew 9.8% to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion in the first half of 2003. The increases in net earned premium for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 were primarily due to growth in the creditor-placed homeowners insurance and extended service contract products.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2004 net operating income increased 31.3% to $39.9 million from $30.4 million in same period in 2003. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 grew 23.7% to $76.6 million from $62.0 million in the first half of 2003. The increases in net operating income for the second quarter and the six-month period of 2004 were primarily due to premium growth and further improvement in combined ratio from already favorable levels.
Assurant Health second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 13.8% to $559.4 million from $491.7 million in the same period in 2003. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 increased 14.6% to $1.1 billion from $968.8 million in the first half of 2003. Net earned premium growth for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 is attributable to continued sales and membership growth in the individual medical product lines. Health Savings Account (HSA) sales continued to be a strong contributor to individual medical sales. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant Health renewed its national marketing alliance with State Farm Insurance, under which Assurant Health is the exclusive provider of individual medical insurance marketed through State Farm agents nationwide.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2004 net operating income decreased 23.8% to $14.0 million when compared to the particularly strong second quarter of 2003 net operating income of $18.4 million. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 increased 2.8% to $27.3 million from $26.5 million in the first half of 2003. The increase in net operating income for the first half of 2004 was primarily due to favorable loss experience in the Disability and Group Life businesses.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 2.1% to $309.2 million from $302.8 million in the same period of 2003. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 grew 0.7% to $627.2 million from $623.0 million in the first half of 2003. Net earned premium increases for the second quarter and the six-month period of 2004 were primarily driven by increases in Disability premiums, which were offset by lower premium growth in the Dental and Group Life product lines as a result of pricing and renewal discipline in an increasingly competitive environment.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2004 net operating income was $10.1 million, up 2.7%
 
from $9.9 million in the same period of 2003. First half 2004 net operating income decreased 12.7% to $16.6 million from $19.0 million in the first half of 2003. The increase in second quarter 2004 net operating income was attributable to actions taken to reduce crediting rates where we have the ability to do so and reduced expenses. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 decreased primarily due to lower new money yields.
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 0.6% to $136.3 million from $137.2 million in the same period of 2003. Assurant Preneed first half 2004 net earned premiums decreased 0.6% to $269.5 million from $271.2 million in the first half of 2003. The segment's sales activity has begun to stabilize compared to a year ago and net earned premiums increased for the second consecutive quarter.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the second quarter of 2004 declined by $8.5 million after-tax compared to the second quarter of 2003 as a result of a lower level of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2004 was $3.8 million, primarily due to public company expenses, including expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, and lower investment income. Additionally, each Assurant business incurred Sarbanes-Oxley related expenses.
Financial Position
At June 30, 2004 total assets were $23.3 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $11.6 billion. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $3.7 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant recorded no other than temporary impairments compared to $3.2 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2003. During the second quarter Assurant sold WorkAbility, a small non core operation and recognized an after-tax loss of $6.3 million.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating
 
income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Safe Harbor Statement:
Some of the statements included in this statistical supplement, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, posted on the Assurant website at www.assurant.com.
 
Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

What is my role in maintaining Assurant's ethical standards?
We are all ambassadors for Assurant. Our actions and the choices we make reflect upon the company and our fellow employees. To this end, it is imperative that we consistently act in a way that enhances Assurant's reputation for the highest ethics and integrity in all of its endeavors.

Trust and confidence are the cornerstones of all of our business relationships at Assurant. All Assurant employees, officers and directors are expected to respect the confidentiality of all information concerning the finances of our businesses, our products, services and systems, the way in which we conduct business, and our dealings with customers.
What information is considered confidential and proprietary?
Proprietary information helps us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to develop and retain a competitive edge, and must be safeguarded and not disclosed to persons outside the company without prior authorization. Such information is for business purposes only and shall never be used for personal gain.
Examples of proprietary information include:
Even within the company and in the course of your employment responsibilities, all employees, officers and directors must safeguard such information.
 
Real life example:
You are attending a seminar or trade meeting, and you have been asked to make a speech or give a presentation. In your discussion, you are thinking about mentioning the possibility of a new vendor contract that has not yet been publicly announced, or financial results that have not yet been disclosed. Is sharing this information permissible?
Q.
No. Although sharing information and best practices with other organizations is important and encouraged, we must be cautious not to share with our competition or potential competition non-public information critical to the way Assurant conducts business.
A.
If you have any questions or doubts about the appropriateness of your discussions or the content of any speech or presentation, be sure to consult your manager or your business' Communications Department. For a copy of the Communications Principles and Guidelines, please contact the Corporate Communications Department at Assurant in New York.
What are the consequences of disclosure of proprietary information?
Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential and proprietary information can be very damaging to our company's business and puts all of our jobs at risk. As a public company, disclosure of proprietary information can also have legal consequences. If you have further questions about the legal ramifications of disclosing proprietary information, please contact your business' Legal Department.
Real life example:
While surfing the Internet, you come across a chat board which includes posting about the AIZ stock. Can you post a comment? Despite what is posted by others, whether positive or negative, it is never permissible to post a comment on such chat boards. As an employee, you may have, or may be perceived as having, information in your possession that is not available to the general public. This information could be considered company property and should remain confidential. Without realizing it, your actions could affect the stock or reputation of our company.
Q.
A.
 
What are the restrictions regarding my use of Assurant's assets?
Protecting Assurant's assets and ensuring their efficient use is a key factor in our business' success. Unless you have the approval of management, Assurant's assets, whether tangible (i.e. a laptop computer) or intangible (i.e. proprietary/confidential information), are to be used only by authorized employees, officers or directors or their designees and only for the legitimate business purposes of Assurant.
Real life example:
You spend a considerable amount of time each day using your business computer surfing the web to plan your upcoming vacation or send personal e-mails. Is this allowed?
Q.
This is not permitted under Assurant's ethical standards since it involves the significant use of company assets, including your paid time, in a way that has no connection to the legitimate business purposes of Assurant. This level of activity is beyond what would be permitted as incidental or minor use.
A.
 
"Moral principle is the foundation of law."
Ronald D. Dworkin
http://en.thinkexist.com/quotation/Moral_principle_is_the_foundation_of_law/224910.html
In keeping with our dedication to operate according to our values, Assurant is committed to upholding all federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our company's businesses and with all applicable company policies. All employees, officers and directors at Assurant are expected to comply fully with all such regulations.
What laws, rules and regulations must I uphold?
Assurant's businesses are subject to a wide range of federal and state laws, regulations and rules. Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed.
 
What is Insider Trading?
Insider trading is the purchase or sale of any company's securities by persons who are aware of material information that is not yet known or available to the public or passing such information on to others who may purchase or sell a company's securities based on material nonpublic information about that company.
Key term:
 
What is "material information?"
Material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold securities. Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect a company's stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material.
Key term:
     
Some examples of material information are:
When is information "public?"
Information is considered to be available to the public after it has been released broadly to the marketplace and the investing public has had time to absorb the information fully. Information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until after the second full business day after the information is released.
If you are aware of material nonpublic information related to Assurant or any other businesses, you may not, directly or indirectly, use such material nonpublic information in purchasing or selling any securities of Assurant or these businesses. In addition, if you are aware of material nonpublic information, you may not have another person purchase or sell securities on your behalf, nor may you disclose such material nonpublic information to any person outside Assurant (including relatives, friends, or business associates, regardless of the purpose for which such disclosure may be made) until authorized Assurant officials have adequately disclosed the information to the public.
 
Real life example:
. After learning about a potential acquisition of another company by Assurant, information which is not yet available to the public, you are thinking about recommending to your brother that he sell his Assurant stock in case of a decline in performance. Is this allowed? No. This is not permitted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or Assurant's Insider Trading Policy, because it involves trading a security or tipping another to trade while in possession of material nonpublic information.
Q
A.
Although employees, directors, officers, consultants and independent contractors of Assurant are prohibited from trading Assurant securities at any time while in possession of material nonpublic information about the company, Assurant has established additional periodsduring which certain covered persons (persons who have or are presumed to have access to material nonpublic information about the company on a regular basis) may not buy or sell Assurant securities.
all
blackout periods
If you are a covered person, the Assurant Legal Department in New York will inform you as to when a blackout period is in effect, during which time you may not buy or sell any Assurant securities or advise or recommend others to buy or sell any Assurant securities.
This section is not intended to be a substitute for reading and understanding the Assurant Insider Trading Policy, which can be found on your business' Intranet site. Before engaging in any transaction, please refer to the Policy for instructions on appropriate conduct and more detail on insider trading laws.
 
"Great organizations demand a high level of commitment by the people involved."

At Assurant, our employees are the key to our success. We are committed to creating a work environment that is consistent with our values and that offers employees the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. In return, employees' commitment to the success of our operations makes us leaders in our businesses. For this reason, Assurant expects all employees, officers and directors to dedicate their best efforts to advancing the company's interests and to use objective and unbiased standards when making decisions that affect our company. Business decisions should be made solely on the basis of quality, suitability, service, price and other competitive factors and without the influence of personal bias or conflicts of interest.
What is a conflict of interest?
A conflict of interest occurs when an employee's, officer's or director's private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the interests of the company. Each employee's, officer's and director's obligation to conduct the company's business in an honest and ethical manner includes the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships.
Some examples of the types of activities that might cause conflicts of interest:
 
Real life example:
A coworker has asked you to hire his/her in-law for a large printing project. You have researched this printer and have found only negative reviews regarding the quality of their work. Should you hire them regardless? You should express your concerns with your coworker, and suggest alternate options. If they insist, you should consult your business' Legal Department for further guidance.
Q.
A.
To whom does this Conflicts of Interest policy apply?
The policies set forth below apply to employees, officers, and directors of Assurant. Certain Assurant businesses or departments may adopt stricter rules, as circumstances require, upon prior approval of the Assurant Legal Department in New York.
Conflicts of Interest may arise in a variety of areas. Assurant's Conflict of Interest policies are described below.
Real life example:
In your free time, you are a member of a soccer team. You have been asked to print 500 fliers for an upcoming game. It would be easier to do this at work than at home, since the office has the supplies you would need. Is this permissible?
Q.
No. This would violate our company's ethical standards because this would involve using Assurant assets, including your paid time as an employee, to benefit an outside organization.
A.
 
3. Financial Interests:
A financial interest is improper if the combination of your position with Assurant, the amount of your investment, and that particular company in which you invested couldwhen viewed objectively by another personinfluence or be perceived to influence your actions as an employee, officer or director of Assurant. Therefore, employees, officers and directors should not make an investment in a company if such investment would conflict with, or be perceived to conflict with, the interests of Assurant.
For example, you should not have a financial or ownership interest in a company (for example, an Assurant competitor, vendor or client) if it could cause you, or be perceived by others to cause you, to choose between that interest and the interests of Assurant. Such an investment may constitute an improper conflict of interest that should be avoided.
As an employee, officer or director, you are expected to regulate your activities so as to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest. If you are unsure whether your investment does or could cause a conflict of interest, please contact the Assurant Legal Department in New York.
4. Loans to Directors and Executive Officers:
In accordance with Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, Assurant and its businesses are prohibited from directly or indirectly granting, extending, maintaining, or arranging for the renewal of, any personal loan or other form of credit (excluding loans permitted under any of Assurant's employee benefit plans) to any director or designated Executive Officer of Assurant, Inc., First Fortis Life Insurance Company, and Fortis Benefits Insurance Company.
5. Loans to Employees and All Other Directors and Officers:
The extension of loans or other forms of credit, or guarantees of obligations thereof, to employees, officers, directors, or their family members create potential conflict of interest issues. Accordingly, all loans or other extensions of credit (excluding loans permitted under any of Assurant's employee benefit plans, Equity Bridge Loans and reimbursements of expenses associated with Relocation Loans, subject to your business' Relocation Policy) are prohibited.
 
6. Corporate Opportunities:
Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to Assurant to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Employees, officers and directors shall not take for personal use (or for use by a family member) any business opportunity learned of during the course of serving Assurant, using Assurant company property or as a result of such individual's position with Assurant. To the extent that an employee, officer or director learns of a business opportunity that is within Assurant's existing or proposed lines of business, that individual should inform the CEO or CFO of his or her business, as appropriate, of the business opportunity and refrain from personally pursuing the matter until such time as Assurant decides to forego the business opportunity. At no time may any employee, officer or director utilize any company property, information or position to generate personal gain or engage or participate in any business that directly competes with Assurant.
7. Employment and Supervision of Closely Related Persons:
In order to maintain Assurant's commitment to fairness and avoid any perception of favoritism, closely related persons (as defined below) may not be employed at Assurant when such employment creates a situation where one relative has direct or indirect authority over the other or where one has the power to reward, supervise, appoint, remove, or discipline the other. An employee may not report directly to a closely related person and two relatives cannot have the same manager unless you have obtained prior approval from your business' Human Resources Department. For further guidance, please refer to your business' local policies.
A closely related person is defined as any person who is related to an employee, officer or director by blood or marriage or was previously related by marriage, including but not limited to, a spouse, domestic partner, ex-spouse/domestic partner, child, parent, grandparent, sibling, mother or father-in-law, son or daughter-in-law, any person living in the employee's, officer's or director's household, and any other relationship listed in your business' policies.
In the case that a person becomes related to an employee, officer or director by blood or marriage or as a domestic partner after they begin their employment with Assurant, that employee, officer or director must inform their business' Human Resources Department for further guidance.
 
8. Gifts and Entertainment:
In all matters related to gifts (any items of monetary value) or entertainment, it is the responsibility of the employee, officer or director to exercise good judgment. Offering or accepting gifts and entertainment is appropriate if there is a specific business purpose, the expenses incurred are ordinary courtesies of business life, such as gifts of nominal value or customary social entertainment, and the gift or entertainment falls within the guidelines of Assurant's travel and entertainment policies (which permit reasonable and appropriate travel and entertainment expenses incurred while engaged in Assurant business activities), this Code of Ethics and all relevant laws and regulations.
An employee, officer or director may not accept or present a gift or entertainment (including, but not limited to, recreation, lodging, transportation and tickets) for the purpose of improperly influencing good business judgment in any business dealing or transaction involving Assurant or any enterprise associated with our company.
Reporting Conflicts of Interest:
Unless prior approval by the Assurant Legal Department in New York is required, as specified above, all conflicts of interest, or material transactions or relationships that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest, must be communicated by the employee or officer directly to their business' Legal Department. The employee or officer reporting the conflict or potential conflict should remove himself or herself from the decision making process. Confidential or anonymous reports regarding conflicts of interest also can be made to the Assurant Ethics and Compliance Hotline at [XXX-XXX-XXXX]*. The individual at the business' Legal Department who has been informed of a conflict of interest shall provide a written report to the Assurant Legal Department in New York detailing the facts of each conflict of interest disclosure.
 
Personal integrity is as important as executive skill in business dealings.
 Russell E. Palmer
http://www.leadershipnow.com/integrityquotes.html
At Assurant, we are committed to creating a supportive work environment where employees can grow and thrive and have strong equal employment policies and processes to help prevent discriminatory conduct. We have a long standing policy of non-discrimination and this policy is reinforced in our values. These values guide our behaviors and ensure our focused commitment to ensuring that all Assurant employees and prospective employees abide by all applicable federal, state and local laws prohibiting discrimination. It is also important to remember that even outside of work, you are viewed by the public as a representative and symbol of Assurant.
How does Assurant promote diversity within the organization?
We understand that diversity is a great strength in an organization. We actively seek a diverse workforce that is comprised of individuals who are capable and deserving of opportunity and employing these individuals in meaningful ways. We make all employment and personnel decisions based on merit, competence and qualifications, and we are committed to employees' advancement and the maximum utilization of their abilities.
All aspects of employment with the company are governed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or any other category protected by federal, state or local law.
What measures does Assurant take to prevent harassment?
We take great care to ensure that our company promotes growth and development in a caring and supportive environment. All Assurant businesses have established strict policies and procedures prohibiting harassment, of any form, of employees, including implied or expressed forms of sexual harassment. All members of management are responsible for the effective administration of these policies. For further information, see your business' local harassment policy.
 
What should I do if I feel I've been a victim of harassment?
If you believe that you have been the subject of discrimination or harassment or retaliation by employees or non-employees, such as outside contractors or vendors, you should report the matter immediately to your business' Human Resources Department. In the event employees advise their managers of these types of issues, managers must contact their business' Human Resources Department.
In the event the complaint involves your business' Head of Human Resources or CEO or your complaint has not been resolved to your satisfaction on a business level, you should contact the Head of Human Resources for Assurant in New York.
In all cases, reports will be investigated promptly and be kept confidential within the bounds of the investigation and the law. Retaliatory action against an employee for a complaint made in good faith will not be tolerated. If a violation is found to exist, appropriate corrective action will be taken, which can include discipline up to and including termination.
Real life example:
You are uncomfortable with your boss' flirtations, but you don't want to say anything out of fear of losing your job. What should you do?
Q.
You should immediately speak to someone in your Human Resources Department. All information will be kept completely confidential within the scope of investigating your complaint, and steps will be taken to remedy the situation. Under no circumstances will retaliatory action be taken against anyone who in good faith reports an allegation.
A.
Please remember to always consult your local sexual harassment policy for detailed information specific to your business' policies and procedures.
 
Keep true, never be ashamed of doing right, decide on what you think is right and stick to it.

It is up to each and every one of us to ensure that Assurant operates according to our ethical standards at all times. In addition to supporting the laws and ethics to which our company is committed, it is your responsibility to report any instances where these laws or ethical standards are being broken.
What should I do if I see something or am asked to do something that I think violates the law or Assurant's ethical standards?
Assurant promotes open communication throughout our company to resolve concerns, problems, or complaints employees may have.
What happens once I report a violation of the law or Assurant's ethical standards to management, my business' Legal or Human Resources Department, my business' local reporting channels or the Assurant Ethics and Compliance Hotline?
Once a report is received by management, your business' Legal or Human Resources Department, or your business' local reporting channels, it is disseminated and investigated by the appropriate person(s) at Assurant, or an external third party, depending on the type of violation.
 
For all reported incidents, prompt and appropriate corrective action will be taken when and as warranted.
Consistent with policies of Assurant, there will be no retaliation directly or indirectly against anyone who in good faith reports an allegation.
Assurant has established the following procedures for the proper investigation and optimal resolution of illegal and/or unethical incidents reported through the Assurant Ethics and Compliance Hotline:
If you make a report of a violation through the Assurant Ethics and Compliance Hotline, it is up to you whether to identify yourself or to make an anonymous report.
 
Please remember that the Assurant Ethics and Compliance Hotline is not intended to address allegations of harassment, discrimination or other employment related matters. You should follow your business' local policies with respect to these topics.
All investigations will be conducted in a confidential manner, to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.

In the event that a Financial Officer learns that any such report, document or communication does not meet this standard and the deviation is material, then such officer shall review and investigate such deviation, advise the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the deviation and, where necessary, revise the relevant report, document or communication.
 
Waivers or exceptions to this Code will be granted only in advance and only under exceptional circumstances by the Assurant Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. Requests for waivers should be submitted in advance to the Assurant Legal Department in New York.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Assurant Reports Q3 2004 Net Income of $74.8 Million ($0.53 per Pro Forma Share) , Net Operating Income of $73.2 Million ($0.52 per Pro Forma Share)
New York  November 4, 2004  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the quarter and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004.
J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Excluding the rare occurrence of four hurricanes, Assurant had a very good quarter. The strength of our diversified specialty insurance strategy is demonstrated in our strong operating performance so far this year. We remain focused on generating profitable growth from our market-leading specialty insurance businesses."
Third Quarter Results:
Net income in the third quarter of 2004, which includes the impact of claims related to the unprecedented catastrophic activity in the quarter, decreased 24.7% to $74.8 million, or $0.53 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release), versus third quarter 2003 net income of $99.4 million, or $0.70 per pro forma share.
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the third quarter of 2004 decreased 23.2% to $73.2 million, or $0.52 per pro forma share, compared to third quarter 2003 net operating income of $95.3 million, or $0.67 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, loss on disposal of business and IPO related expenses.
Net earned premiums in the third quarter of 2004 grew 3.7% to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion for the same period in 2003. Assurant Health was the leading contributor of net earned premium growth in the third quarter of 2004.
Net investment income in the third quarter of 2004 increased to $160.0 million from $150.7 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of an increase in invested assets.
 
The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.56% in the third quarter of 2004, compared to 5.71% in the third quarter of 2003.
Nine-Month Results:
Net income in the first nine months of 2004 grew 0.4% to $264.4 million, or $1.86 per pro forma share, versus first nine months 2003 net income of $263.3 million, or $1.85 per pro forma share.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2004 grew 1.6% to $258.4 million, or $1.82 per pro forma share, compared to first nine months 2003 net operating income of $254.4 million, or $1.79 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, loss on disposal of business and IPO-related expenses.
Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 grew 6.9% to $4.8 billion from $4.5 billion for the same period in 2003.
Net investment income in the first nine months of 2004 increased to $471.5 million from $456.6 million in the first nine months of 2003 as a result of an increase in invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.47% for the first nine months of 2004, compared to 5.81% for the first nine months of 2003.
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2004 net operating income was $3.0 million, down 90.5% from third quarter 2003 net operating income of $31.4 million. Net operating income for the first nine months in 2004 was $81.6 million down 18.5% from $100.1 million in the first nine months of 2003. Net operating income for the third quarter and nine-month period of 2004 decreased due to claims from four hurricanes during the quarter. After tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in the quarter were $49.1 million, compared to $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding these losses, net operating income increased primarily due to good loss experience and general business growth.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 1.7% to $602.7 million from $612.9 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 grew 5.7% to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2003. The changes in net earned premium were primarily due to growth in our specialty property products and international businesses offset by declines in domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2004 net operating income increased 56.4% to $47.9 million from $30.6 million in same period in 2003. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2004 grew 34.5% to $124.5 million from $92.6 million in the first nine months of 2003. The increases in net operating income for the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2004 were primarily due to individual medical premium growth and continued improvement in combined ratio from already favorable levels.
Assurant Health third quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 11.1% to $563.2 million from $506.7 million in the same period in 2003. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 increased 13.4% to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2003. Net earned premium growth for the third quarter and nine-month period of 2004 is attributable to the individual medical product lines. For the third consecutive quarter, Health Savings Account (HSA) sales continued to be a strong contributor to individual medical sales.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2004 net operating income decreased 32.2% to $15.0 million from net operating income of $22.1 million in the same period of 2003. Net operating income for the nine months of 2004 decreased 13.1% to $42.2 million from $48.6 million in the first nine months of 2003. Third quarter 2003 results benefited from a change in reserves of $11.5 million after tax. Excluding this reserve change, net operating income for the third quarter and nine months of 2004 increased due to continued improvements in loss experience in the disability and group life businesses and increased investment income.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 2.9% to $305.8 million from $297.3 million in the same period of 2003. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 grew 1.4% to $933.0 million from $920.3 million in the first nine months of 2003. Net earned premium increases for the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2004 were primarily driven by increases in disability premiums. Modest premium growth was a result of pricing and renewal discipline in a competitive market, however voluntary sales continue to show strong growth.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2004 net operating income was $8.9 million, essentially unchanged from the same period of 2003. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2004 decreased 8.3% to $25.5 million from $27.9 million in the first nine months of 2003. The decrease in net operating income was attributable to a reduction in investment yields resulting from continued low new money rates.
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2004 net earned premiums increased 1.7% to $131.8 million from $129.6 million in the same period of 2003. Assurant Preneed first nine months 2004 net earned premiums of $401.3 million were comparable to $400.9 million in the first nine months of 2003.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 declined by $9.2 million after tax compared to the third quarter of 2003 due to lower levels of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2004 was $1.2 million, compared to income of $9.9 million in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to public company expenses, including expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance, and lower investment income.
Financial Position
At September 30, 2004 total assets were $23.6 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $12.1 billion. In the third quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $1.6 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. In the third quarter of 2004, Assurant recorded no other than temporary impairments.
As part of its approved share repurchase program of up to 10% of its outstanding common stock, Assurant repurchased 1.36 million shares in the open market during the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, for an average price of $26.00 per share, including commissions. As a result, on September 30, 2004, the Company had 140.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. The stock buyback program may utilize open market and/or private transactions. The amount and timing of the repurchases will depend upon market conditions.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
 
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003.

These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On December 17, 2004, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") is entering into Change of Control Severance Agreements with several executive officers and employees effective as of January 1, 2005. The severance agreements generally provide that if a change in control (as defined) occurs with respect to Assurant, Inc. for certain employees, and with respect to the business segment for which an employee works for others, then a two-year trigger period begins. If the employee's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or if the employee resigns for good reason (each as defined) during such two-year period, the employee is entitled to certain cash severance payments and continuation of medical and other welfare benefits for a period of 18 months following the termination of employment at the rate charged active employees.
     The amount of cash severance benefits payable to an employee is equal to a multiple (ranging from 1 to 3 depending on the agreement) times the sum of the employee's annual base salary and target annual bonus. The multiple for each of the Company's named executive officers, who are listed below, is 3. The cash severance for all employees is payable in a lump sum within thirty days of the date the employee's employment is terminated.
     In addition, an employee will be entitled to the cash severance and continuation of welfare benefits if a change of control occurs and the employee's employment was terminated by the Company without cause (or the employee resigned for good reason) within one year prior to the change in control, in each case in anticipation of the change of control (as defined). In this case, the cash severance will be paid in a lump sum within thirty days after the date on which the change of control occurs, and the Company will reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining continued welfare benefits between the date of termination and the date of the change of control.
     The agreements also provide additional rights including, but not limited to, outplacement services, legal fee reimbursement and reimbursement for any excise tax imposed on the employee by section 4999 of the U.S. tax code.
Item 9.01 Exhibits & Financial Statements
     The Company is entering into Change of Control Severance Agreements in substantially the form described in this report with the following named executive officers:
     The form of the agreement entered into with Mr. Clayton, Mr. Pollock and Ms. Silvester is attached as Exhibit 99.1, and the form of the agreement entered into with Mr. Camacho is attached as Exhibit 99.2. Mr. Camacho's agreement differs from the agreements for the other named executive officers because Mr. Camacho works with the Assurant Solutions business segment, and the other named executive officers work with Assurant, Inc., the holding company.
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
     THIS CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made by and between Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") and (the "Executive"), and is effective as of the 1st day of January, 2005.
                   
                   
     The Executive's Multiplier (as defined in Section 1(f) below) is 3.
     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to encourage Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change in Control, and to provide Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations.

Exhibit 99.2
     THIS CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made by and between Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") and          (the "Executive"), an officer of the Assurant Solutions Division (as defined in Section 1(d) below), and is effective as of the 1st day of January, 2005.
     The Executive's Multiplier (as defined in Section 1(f) below) is 3.
     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to encourage Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change in Control, and to provide Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
     IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES SET FORTH HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the Severance to which the Executive would be entitled if his or her employment terminated on the CIC Date; provided, however, that if such amount deposited in the Rabbi Trust together with any interest or earnings thereon is determined later to be less than or more than the amount of the Severance, if any, that actually becomes due to the Executive hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to the amount required by this Agreement and not the amount that is held in such trust. In the event that the Executive does not become entitled to the Severance, as determined by the trustee of the Rabbi Trust, the amount remaining in the Rabbi Trust shall be returned to the Company after the expiration of the Post-CIC Period. The Rabbi Trust shall be used solely for the purpose of holding deposits of funds for the potential Severance obligations to the Executive hereunder, and other similar obligations to similarly situated employees of the Company.
 
 
 
 
 
or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance with this Section. Notice and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set the Executive's hand and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of Directors, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed in its name on its behalf by its undersigned officer thereunto, duly authorized, all as of the day and year first above written.
 
     THIS RELEASE (this "Release") is granted effective as of the                       day of                                          ,                       , by                                          (the "Executive") in favor of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company"). This is the Release referred to in that certain Change in Control Severance Agreement dated as of                       , 200                       by and between the Company and the Executive (the "CIC Agreement").

Section 8 - Other Events Item 8.01 Other Events. Our third quarter results included losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, of approximately $49 million after-tax related to the four hurricanes that impacted the Southeast United States during the quarter. This amount included loss estimates for claims reported but not yet paid and for claims incurred but not reported. At this time, a majority of the claims have been reported and settled and we are in a better position to understand how our total loss exposure will develop. We now believe that our total losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, will be approximately $59 million after-tax for the four hurricanes. Losses have been higher than originally estimated primarily due to the escalating costs of materials and labor as each storm reduced supplies of materials and available skilled workers. We believe that final loss development, net of reinsurance recoveries, will be very close to our revised estimate of approximately $59 million after-tax. 2

The Termination and Amendment Agreement will amend the Registration Rights Agreement so that it provides that, in the event of any registration of securities of the Company that involve an underwritten offering pursuant to the rights granted under the Registration Rights Agreement to Fortis and its affiliates that are stockholders of the Company, the Company may select the lead managing underwriter or underwriters and bookrunner or bookrunners for such underwritten offering after consultation with Fortis and such affiliates. The Termination and Amendment Agreement will further amend the Registration Rights Agreement so that it provides that the Company and Fortis and its affiliates that are stockholders of the Company will each pay its own expenses with respect to any offering pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement that is publicly announced after January 10, 2005. In addition, the Termination and Amendment Agreement will eliminate the right of Fortis and its affiliates that are stockholders of the Company to demand registration rights with respect to certain hedging transactions. All other terms of the Registration Rights Agreement will remain in effect. The Termination and Amendment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 3.5 to this report and incorporated by reference herein. On January 13, 2005, the Company also entered into a letter agreement, dated as of January 10, 2005 (the "Letter Agreement"), with Fortis concerning certain corporate governance matters. The Letter Agreement will become effective upon the closing of the Offering. Under the Letter Agreement, if at any time while there are no vacancies on the Company's 12-member board of directors (the "Board"), the Board or a committee thereof, adopts a resolution (i) recommending to the Company's shareholders that a particular candidate be elected to the Board to replace one of the Fortis designees on the Board or (ii) appointing to the Board a new member, then Fortis will cause one of the Fortis designees to resign from the Board promptly following the adoption of such resolution. In addition, the Letter Agreement provides that if at any time Fortis ceases to own more than 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, Fortis will promptly cause any remaining Fortis designees to resign from the Board. The Letter Agreement further provides that if at any time while at least one Fortis designee remains on the Board, the Board, including any Fortis designee, votes in favor of certain significant corporate actions, Fortis will agree to votes its shares of the Company's common stock in favor of any such actions. The Letter Agreement is filed as Exhibit 3.6 to this report and incorporated by reference herein. Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. Pursuant to the Termination and Amendment Agreement described above under Item 1.01, the Shareholders' Agreement will be terminated effective upon the closing of the Offering. The Shareholders' Agreement provides that (i) so long as Fortis owns at least 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock, Fortis will have the right to nominate two designees to the Board and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, Fortis will have the right to nominate one designee to the Board. In addition, under the Shareholders' Agreement, for so long as Fortis continues to own at least 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock, certain significant corporate actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis, as stockholder. 2

Table of Contents
Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On February 7, 2005, the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated the Assurant Investment Plan, and renamed such plan the "Assurant, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan." Key terms of the Plan are described below.
     Employees and directors are eligible to participate in the Plan; provided, however, that employees must be members of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company.
Eligibility.
     . The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors and a committee designated by the Board to perform certain of its duties and responsibilities under the Plan.
Administration
     . Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary and up to 100% of incentive payments or directors fees. Such amounts will be automatically withheld from the participant's paycheck, or, in the case of incentive payments or directors fees, at the time such payments would otherwise be paid to the participant. Participants will be fully vested in their deferral accounts.
Participant Deferral Accounts
     . The Company may, but is not required to, credit a participant's "Company discretionary account" on an annual basis in an amount, if any, chosen by the Company in its sole discretion. Participants will vest in their Company discretionary accounts pursuant to a vesting schedule approved by the administrator.
Company Discretionary Accounts
     . Deferral elections must be made before the last day of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant is to perform the services giving rise to the compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the participant's first plan year of eligibility, he or she must make a deferral election no later than thirty (30) days after the date he or she became eligible to participate. With respect to incentive payments which qualify as performance-based compensation (as such term is defined in the Plan), the participant may make an election to defer such payments no later than six (6) months prior to the last day of the period during which the participant performs the services giving rise to the performance-based compensation. Unless otherwise provided by the administrator, participants may not change their deferral elections that are in effect for a plan year.
Deferral Elections
      . Participants may elect one or more "measurement funds" chosen by the administrator for the purpose of crediting or debiting additional amounts to his or her account balance. The measurement funds are used to track "phantom" investment returns only, and participants will not be considered to be actual investors in
Investment Elections
Table of Contents
such funds. Account balances under the Plan are bookkeeping entries only. The administrator may discontinue, substitute, or add measurement funds to the Plan in its discretion, and participants may change their deemed investment election on a daily basis.
     Participants will receive a distribution under the Plan (i) upon a fixed date designated in the participant's deferral election, if any; (ii) upon his or her termination of employment; (iii) upon his or her death or disability; or (iv) in limited circumstances, upon the occurrence of an unforeseeable financial emergency. Participants will elect the form of distribution in connection with their deferral election, and distributions cannot be accelerated except as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Distributions under the Plan.
     Upon a participant's termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or an authorized leave of absence, the participant will receive his or her vested account balance, paid pursuant to his or her distribution election. Specified employees will not receive any portion of their vested account balance prior to the date which is six months after the date of his or her termination of employment.
     Upon a participant's death while employed, his or her beneficiary will receive a survivor benefit in an amount equal to the participant's entire vested account balance, paid pursuant to his or her distribution election. Upon a participant's death after his or her termination of employment or disability, but before the termination benefit or disability benefit is paid in full, the participant's unpaid termination benefit or disability benefit payments will continue and will be paid to the participant's beneficiary over the remaining number of years and in the same amounts as that benefit would have been paid to the participant had the participant survived.
     If a participant incurs a disability under the terms of the Plan, he or she will receive his or her entire vested account balance, paid pursuant to his or her distribution election.
     Upon a participant's authorized, paid leave of absence from the Company, the participant's deferral amount will continue to be withheld from the participant's earnings, incentive payments and/or director fees. Upon a participant's authorized, unpaid leave of absence from the Company, the participant's automatic deferrals will be excused until the earlier of the date the leave of absence expires or the participant returns to a paid service status. Upon such expiration or return, deferrals will resume.
Leave of Absence.
     The Plan may be terminated or amended at any time. Upon a complete or partial termination of the Plan, vested account balances will be paid to participants, in an amount determined as if they had incurred a termination of employment on the date of Plan termination. Termination of the Plan may not adversely affect the rights of any participant or beneficiary under the Plan. No
Termination and Amendment of the Plan.
Table of Contents
amendment may decrease or restrict the value of a participant's vested account balance in existence at the time of such amendment, calculated as if the participant had incurred a termination of employment as of the date of such amendment.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2004. J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "One year after our initial public offering, Assurant continues to increase shareholder value and generate profitable growth through our leading specialty insurance businesses. Our ability to grow net operating income, in spite of the very rare occurrence of four significant hurricanes during the year, demonstrates the inherent strength of our diversified platform." FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS: Net income in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $86.1 million, or $0.61 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release), versus a fourth quarter 2003 net loss of $77.6 million, or $(0.55) per pro forma share. Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act, Assurant in the fourth quarter of 2004 repatriated $110 million of capital from its Puerto Rico affiliate, which resulted in an additional tax charge, net of certain other tax adjustments, of $8.7 million. The year-ago period included a one-time after tax interest premium of $133.8 million on the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities prior to the initial public offering. Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 15.6% to $86.5 million, or $0.62 per pro forma share, compared to fourth quarter 2003 net operating income of $74.8 million, or $0.53 per pro forma share. Net operating income was reduced by the one time $8.7 million or $0.06 per share tax adjustment. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses, IPO-related expenses and interest premium on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.
Net earned premiums of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 are up slightly from the same period in 2003. Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased to $163.3 million from $150.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.55% in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 5.47% in the fourth quarter of 2003. TWELVE-MONTH RESULTS: Net income in 2004 grew 88.8% to $350.6 million, or $2.48 per pro forma share, versus 2003 net income of $185.7 million or $1.31 per pro forma share. Excluding the 2003 one-time interest premium paid of $133.8 million on the redemption of preferred securities of subsidiary trusts prior to the initial public offering, 2004 net income grew 9.7%. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2004 grew 4.8% to $345.0 million, or $2.44 per pro forma share, compared to twelve months 2003 net operating income of $329.2 million, or $2.31 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains, loss on disposal of business, IPO-related expenses and interest premium on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Net earned premiums in 2004 grew 5.3% to $6.5 billion from $6.2 billion in 2003, driven primarily by premium growth in Assurant Health and Assurant Solutions. Net investment income in the twelve months of 2004 increased to $634.7 million from $607.3 million in the twelve months of 2003 as a result of an increase in invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.46% for the twelve months of 2004, compared to 5.61% for the twelve months of 2003. Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
ASSURANT SOLUTIONS Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2004 net operating income was $44.6 million, up 34.7% from fourth quarter 2003 net operating income of $33.1 million. Net operating income for the fourth quarter increased due to significantly reduced loss experience in the specialty property business. Net operating income for the twelve months in 2004 was $126.2 million, down 5.3% from $133.2 million in the twelve months of 2003. Net operating income decreased due to the unprecedented claims activity from four hurricanes during the third quarter of 2004. Total pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, for 2004 were $93.1 million, compared with $29.7 million in 2003. Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 2.0% to $612.2 million from $625.0 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the year grew 3.7% to $2.45 billion from $2.36 billion in 2003. The change in net earned premiums was primarily due to overall growth in the specialty property business, extended service contract business and international businesses, offset somewhat by the runoff in domestic credit insurance. ASSURANT HEALTH Assurant Health fourth quarter 2004 net operating income increased 18.7% to $33.7 million from $28.4 million in the same period in 2003. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2004 grew 30.8% to $158.3 million from $121.0 million in the twelve months of 2003. The increases in net operating income for the fourth quarter and the twelve -month period of 2004 were primarily due to individual medical premium growth, and a favorable combined ratio, offset somewhat by expenses related to second-generation HSA product development and pilot testing of direct-to-consumer marketing programs. Assurant Health fourth quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 4.5% to $557.8 million from $533.7 million in the same period in 2003. Net earned premiums in 2004 increased 11.1% to $2.2 billion from $2.0 billion in 2003. Net earned premium growth is attributable to the individual medical insurance business, including premium rate increases and the successful introduction of individual medical insurance policies that included an HSA. ASSURANT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2004 net operating income increased 54.3% to $20.0 million from net operating income of $12.9 million in the same period of 2003. Net operating income for 2004 increased 1.0% to $62.2 million from $61.6 million in 2003. Excluding a 2003 after tax reserve release of $11.5 million, net operating income for 2004 increased 24.2%. Net operating income for the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2004 increased primarily due to continued improvements in loss experience in disability insurance and increased investment income. Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 2.3% to $343.8 million from $336.1 million in the same period of 2003. Net earned premiums in 3
2004 grew 1.6% to $1.28 billion from $1.26 billion in 2003. Net earned premium increases were primarily driven by higher disability premiums. ASSURANT PRENEED Assurant Preneed fourth quarter 2004 net operating income increased 6.6% to $8.7 million from net operating income of $8.2 million in the same period of 2003. Net operating income for 2004 decreased 5.0% to $34.2 million from $36.0 million in 2003. The decrease in net operating income in 2004 was attributable to a reduction in investment yields resulting from continued low new money rates. The increase in net operating income for the fourth quarter is due to the reduction of policy crediting rates and expenses. Assurant Preneed fourth quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 2.8% to $124.8 million from $128.4 million in the same period of 2003. Assurant Preneed twelve months 2004 net earned premiums of $526.1 million decreased 0.6% from $529.3 million in the twelve months of 2003, a result of a slight sales decrease due to lower policy crediting rates. CORPORATE Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 decreased by $7.1 million after tax compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 due to lower levels of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $19.8 million, compared to a loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The fourth quarter of 2004 included a one-time tax provision on $110 million of capital repatriated from Assurant's Puerto Rico affiliate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act and other tax adjustments amounting to a net charge of $8.7 million. 2004 corporate loss totaled $35.3 million versus net operating income of $7.2 million in 2003. Expenses increased due to stock appreciation rights costs and public company costs, including expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance. FINANCIAL POSITION At December 31, 2004 total assets were $24.0 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $12.4 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $1.2 million compared to net realized after-tax losses of $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. On December 31, 2004, the Company had 139.8 million shares of common stock outstanding.

For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. (1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the 5
company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. (2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. 6

[ASSURANT LOGO] REGULATION G - NON GAAP MEASURES Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. (1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. (2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. (3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period. (4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On March 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") established performance goals and target short-term incentive awards for executive officers for fiscal year 2005 under the Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The final value of such awards will be determined pursuant to four equally-weighted factors: (a) earnings per share, determined using net operating income, (for those in a Business Unit, Net Operating Income of the Business Unit) (b) return on equity, determined using net operating income and equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, (for those in a Business Unit, return on equity of the Business Unit) (c) compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as determined by the Audit Committee, and (d) Company growth performance, determined as a weighted average of the results of certain emphasized lines of business in each business unit, measured with respect to a new sales measure and/or GAAP revenue (for those in a Business Unit, growth performance of the Business Unit.) Net operating income will be normalized for the effect of acquisitions, divestitures, changes in accounting principles, and other significant events, and, for those in a Business Unit, for the economic effect of the variance of plan versus actual allocated equity.
     The performance of the Company, or of a Business Unit, as so determined, will constitute the "corporate" component of performance evaluation for all officers. Officers below the Executive Management Committee level may have other measures included in their evaluation.
     Target awards, expressed as a percentage of base salary for various performance levels, were established for each participant. Actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2005 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds, or falls short of the applicable performance goals. Performance against the criteria is measured on a five-point scale, as follows:
     On March 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Assurant's named executive officers. The following table sets forth the current base salary and target short-term incentive award for 2005 for such named executive officers:

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On April 7, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Assurant Long Term Incentive Plan (the "ALTIP") as a sub-plan under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"). The ALTIP provides a framework for annual grants of restricted stock and stock appreciation rights under the 2004 Plan to eligible employees of the Company.
     The Compensation Committee will establish target amounts for ALTIP awards based upon a percentage of each participant's base compensation. Actual awards may range from 75% to 125% of the target amount based upon such criteria as the Committee deems relevant. Generally, annual awards under the ALTIP will consist (i) 25% of restricted stock, which will vest one-third each year on the anniversary of the date of grant, and (ii) 75% of stock appreciation rights, which will vest as of December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which the award was granted. Vesting will accelerate in full upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company and on a pro rata basis in the event of the participant's death, disability, or retirement. To the extent not earlier exercised by the participant, vested stock appreciation rights issued pursuant to the ALTIP automatically will be exercised on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the date of grant; (ii) the second anniversary of the date of the participant's retirement, disability, or death; (iii) the date of a change in control of the Company; or (iv) ninety days following the participant's termination of employment with the Company. All stock appreciation rights issued pursuant to the ALTIP will be settled in shares of Company common stock, although the Company may settle fractional shares in cash.
     On April 7, 2005, the Compensation Committee also approved the grant of ALTIP awards to the Company's named executive officers in fiscal year 2005. The following table sets forth the current base salary and 2005 ALTIP award amount for such named executive officers:
 
     The ALTIP also provides for the cancellation, as of June 30, 2005, of unexercised cash-based Assurant, Inc. appreciation incentive rights (the "Corporate Rights") and business unit appreciation incentive rights (the "Business Unit Rights") issued under the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan, as amended and restated (the "AAIR Plan"). Immediately following such cancellation, the Company will issue replacement stock appreciation rights pursuant to the ALTIP with respect to such cancelled AAIR rights. The number of replacement awards granted with respect to the Corporate Rights will be equal to the number of the cancelled Corporate Rights. The number of replacement awards granted with respect to Business Unit Rights will be determined based upon the ratio of the strike price of the cancelled Business Unit Rights to the fair market value of such cancelled Business Unit Rights. The term and vesting provision of all replacement awards will be identical to the original AAIR rights, but all replacement awards issued pursuant to the ALTIP will be settled in shares of Company common stock.

     The Assurant Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is hereby adopted by Assurant, Inc. (the "Corporation") effective as of April ___, 2005.
     1.1 . The Plan is a sub-plan created under the Assurant, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2004 LTIP"). The Plan provides a framework for grants of restricted stock and stock appreciation rights under the 2004 LTIP to eligible employees of the Company and its Affiliates. The Plan also provides for the cancellation as of June 30, 2005, of unexercised appreciation rights issued under the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2004), and the grant of replacement stock appreciation rights with respect to such cancelled rights. It is intended that neither the restricted stock nor the stock appreciation rights that are issued under the Plan shall constitute "deferred compensation" as determined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), and IRS Notice 2005-1, and the Plan shall be so interpreted.
GENERAL
     2.1 The provisions of the 2004 LTIP are hereby incorporated by reference.
IN GENERAL.
     2.2 . The following additional definitions are included in this Plan:
ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS
      (a) "2004 LTIP" shall mean the Assurant, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
      (b) "Effective Date" of this Plan means April ___, 2005.
      (c) "Plan" means the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time.
      (d) "Retirement" shall have the same meaning as it has in the Company's Employees Uniform Retirement Plan or any comparable plan that replaces such plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time, provided that, if such plan shall be terminated and not replaced by another comparable plan, then Retirement shall mean a Participant's termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate after attaining any normal or early retirement age specified in any pension, profit sharing or other retirement program sponsored by the Company, or, in the event of the inapplicability thereof with respect to the individual in question, as determined by the Committee in its reasonable judgment.
 
     3.1 . The Plan was adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board on April ___, 2005.
EFFECTIVE DATE
     3.2 . Because this Plan is sub-plan under the 2004 LTIP, the Plan shall continue until the expiration of the 2004 LTIP, unless this Plan is earlier terminated by the Compensation Committee of the Board. If the Plan is terminated, such termination shall not affect the validity of any Award outstanding on the date of termination
TERMINATION OF PLAN
     4.1 Awards under this Plan, other than under Article 6, shall be determined by the Committee with respect to a nominal target amount that is a percentage of each Participant's base compensation. The actual target amount for each Participant may be 75% to 125% of the nominal target amount, as determined by the Committee based upon such criteria as it deems relevant. It is generally intended that the value of an Award will consist (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of a Restricted Stock Award, based on Fair Market Value of Company Stock as of the effective date of such Award; and (ii) seventy-five percent (75%) of Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to Company Stock, based on a Black-Scholes or other option valuation methodology adopted by the Committee from time to time; however, the relative proportion of Awards between Restricted Stock and Stock Appreciation Rights may be varied from Participant to Participant.
DIVISION OF AWARDS BETWEEN RESTRICTED STOCK AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
     4.2. Restricted Stock Awards that are granted under this Plan shall be governed by the 2004 LTIP, and in particular Article 10 of the 2004 LTIP. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Awards under this Plan shall be determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award and shall be reflected in an Award Certificate. It is generally intended that Restricted Stock Awards under this Plan shall vest one-third on the first anniversary of the date the Award was granted, one-third on the second anniversary of the date the Award was granted, and the remainder on the third anniversary of the date the Award was granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a Participant shall become fully vested in all of his Restricted Stock Awards as of the date the Company undergoes a Change in Control, and (ii) if a Participant Retires, becomes Disabled, or dies, then as of the date of such event the Participant shall vest pro rata in each Award based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of completed calendar months from the date specified in the Award (which generally shall be January 1 of the calendar year in which the Award was granted) to the date of the Participant's Retirement, Disability, or death, and the denominator of which is thirty-six (36).
GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.
     4.3 . Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted under this Plan shall be governed by the 2004 LTIP, and in particular Article 8 of the 2004 LTIP. The terms and conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights under this Plan shall be determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award and shall be reflected in an Award Certificate.
GRANT OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
     5.1. . Each Stock Appreciation Rights Award shall vest as of December 31 of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Award was granted, provided that the Participant must be actively employed by the Company or an Affiliate as of such date for vesting to occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a Participant shall become fully vested in all of the granted Stock Appreciation Rights as of the date the Company undergoes a Change in Control, and (ii) if a Participant Retires, becomes Disabled, or dies, then as of the date of such event the Participant shall vest pro rata in each Award based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of completed calendar months from the date specified in the Award (which generally shall be January 1 of the calendar year in which the Award was granted) to the date of the Participant's Retirement, Disability, or death, and the denominator of which is thirty-six (36).
VESTING OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
     5.2 Subject to any applicable securities law restrictions, a Participant may exercise any vested Stock Appreciation Right as of any business day.
DISCRETIONARY EXERCISE OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
     5.3 Any unexercised Stock Appreciation Rights that have become vested shall be automatically exercised, without election by the Participant, on the earliest of (i) the fifth anniversary of the date the Award was granted; (ii) the second anniversary of the date of the Participant's Retirement, Disability, or death, (iii) the date the Company undergoes a Change in Control; or (iv) ninety (90) days following the Participant's termination of employment with the Company and its Affiliates
MANDATORY EXERCISE OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
.
     5.4 . Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant to whom it is granted has the right to receive the excess, if any, of:
RIGHT TO PAYMENT
(i) The Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise, minus
(ii) The grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as determined by the Committee, which shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Grant Date.
Upon exercise, the value of all Appreciation Incentive Rights shall be paid as described in Section 5.5.
     5.5 The aggregate value determined under Section 5.4, shall be paid solely in Shares of Company Stock; provided, however, that partial shares shall be paid in cash unless it is determined that this could negate the Company's intent with respect to the tax and accounting treatment of the Plan. Subject to the preceding sentence, the number of Shares to be delivered shall be determined by dividing the aggregate value determined under Section 5.4 by the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise, net of any taxes required to be withheld by the Company with respect to such Award.
FORM OF PAYMENT OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
     6.1 Effective as of 12:01 am on June 30, 2005, all Assurant, Inc. Appreciation Incentive Rights and all Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights, whether or not vested, that (i) were issued under the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2004 (the "AAIR Plan"); and (ii) have not been exercised by midnight on June 29, 2005, shall be cancelled.
CANCELLATION OF ASSURANT, INC. APPRECIATION INCENTIVE RIGHTS AND BUSINESS UNIT APPRECIATION INCENTIVE RIGHTS.
     6.2 . Immediately following the cancellation of Assurant, Inc. Appreciation Incentive Rights described in Section 6.1, there shall be granted under this Plan to each Participant with Rights that were cancelled, whether or not vested, a number of Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to Company Stock (referred to herein as "Replacement Rights") that is equal to the number of cancelled Assurant, Inc. Appreciation Incentive Rights. Each Replacement Right that is granted with respect to a cancelled vested Right shall be vested immediately; and each Replacement Right that is granted with respect to a cancelled non-vested Right shall become vested on the vesting date for the corresponding cancelled Right. Each Replacement Right shall become exercisable on the date the Replacement Right becomes vested, and shall remain exercisable for the remaining term of the corresponding cancelled right described in Section 6.1.
GRANT OF REPLACEMENT RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CANCELLED ASSURANT, INC. APPRECIATION INCENTIVE RIGHTS
     6.3 . Immediately following the cancellation of Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights described in Section 6.1, there shall be granted under this Plan to each Participant with Rights that were cancelled, whether or not vested, a number of Replacement Rights with respect to Company Stock determined as follows:
GRANT OF REPLACEMENT RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CANCELLED BUSINESS UNIT APPRECIATION INCENTIVE RIGHTS
      (i) For all Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights that were granted in a given year, the Committee shall determine the ratio of the strike price of the cancelled Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights to the Fair Market Value of such cancelled Rights, as most recently determined by the Committee. For each Replacement Right issued under this Section 6.3, the ratio of the strike price to Fair Market Value (as of the date of grant of the Replacement Right) shall be the same as the ratio determined under the preceding sentence.
      (ii) The Committee shall determine the aggregate spread of the cancelled Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights described in clause (i).
      (iii) The number of Replacement Rights to be issued to each Participant under this Section 6.3 shall be determined by dividing the aggregate spread under clause (ii) by the individual spread of each Replacement Right, as determined under clause (i).
The Committee may establish a reasonable conversion methodology where the aggregate spread between the strike price of the cancelled Business Unit Appreciation Incentive Rights to the Fair Market Value of such cancelled Rights is zero or less. Each Replacement Right that is granted with respect to a cancelled vested Right shall be vested immediately; and each Replacement Right that is granted with respect to a
 
cancelled non-vested Right shall become vested on the vesting date for the corresponding cancelled Right. Each Replacement Right shall become exercisable on the date the Replacement Right becomes vested and shall remain exercisable for the remaining term of the corresponding cancelled right described in Section 6.1.
     The foregoing is hereby acknowledged as being the Assurant, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board on April ___, 2005.

Item 1.01         Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On April 29, 2005, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and provides for loans, including loans to fund the Company's maturing commercial paper, in an aggregate amount of up to $500 million. The Company may, subject to certain terms and conditions, increase the total amount of the revolving credit facility up to $750 million. The revolving credit facility is available until April 2010 so long as the Company is not in default.
     Interest under the revolving credit facility is variable, and is based on, at the Company's option, (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.300% to 0.750% per annum or (ii) the higher of the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or 0.500% over the federal funds rate. The Company is also required to pay, on a quarterly basis, a commitment fee ranging from 0.070% to 0.150% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The margin for LIBOR loans and the amount of commitment fees to be paid are both determined on the basis of the senior unsecured debt rating of the Company. At any time during which the aggregate amount of outstanding loans exceeds 50% of the total commitments under the revolving credit facility, the applicable interest rate will be increased by an additional 0.010% per annum.
     The revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the revolving credit facility requires that the Company maintain (i) a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization not to exceed 0.35 to 1.0 and (ii) a consolidated adjusted net worth of not less than the sum of (x) $2,477,212,000 plus (y) 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for each fiscal quarter ending after December 31, 2004 plus (z) 100% of the net cash proceeds received by the Company after December 31, 2004 from any issuance by the Company of its capital stock.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  May 4, 2005  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the first quarter 2005.
Net income in the first quarter of 2005 was $114.4 million, or $0.82 per share, versus a first quarter 2004 net income of $94.4 million, or $0.66 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release).
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the first quarter of 2005 increased 32% to $115.1 million, or $0.82 per share, compared to first quarter 2004 net operating income of $87.5 million, or $0.62 per pro forma share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and IPO and secondary offering expenses.
J. Kerry Clayton, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "We are pleased with Assurant's first quarter performance. All four of our businesses contributed to our strong growth in net operating income. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified specialty insurance strategy and continue to deliver shareholder value and profitable growth."
Net earned premiums of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2005 are unchanged from the same period in 2004.
Net investment income in the first quarter of 2005 increased to $164.2 million from $153.8 million in the first quarter of 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.51% in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 5.43% in the first quarter of 2004 and 5.55% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2005 net operating income was $54.8 million, up 37% from first quarter 2004 net operating income of $40.1 million. Net operating income for the first quarter 2005 increased due to continued favorable loss experience in the specialty property business, as well as growth in investment income and fee income.
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2005 net earned premiums decreased 1% to $615.2 million from $623.1 million in the same year-ago period. The quarterly decline is a result of higher than normal premiums in the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to the timing of recognition of earned premiums in our extended service contracts business. Domestic credit insurance premiums continued to decline, offset by strong international growth.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health first quarter 2005 net operating income increased 35% to $49.7 million from $36.7 million in the same period in 2004. The increase in net operating income for the first quarter was driven by low medical loss ratios and expenses resulting in an 89.7% combined ratio.
Assurant Health first quarter 2005 net earned premiums of $549.5 million were essentially flat from the same period in 2004. Premium increases in the individual medical business were offset by declines in small group premiums.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2005 net operating income increased 24% to $16.4 million from net operating income of $13.2 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the first quarter 2005 increased primarily due to improved life mortality and favorable expenses.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2005 net earned premiums grew 9% to $345.9 million from $318.0 million in the same period of 2004. Net earned premium increases for the first quarter of 2005 were primarily driven by higher disability premiums. Disability premiums include single premium amounts of $26.7 million in the first quarter of 2005 and $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2004 related to the assumption of closed blocks of disability claims.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2005 net operating income increased 8% to $7.0 million from net operating income of $6.5 million in the same period of 2004. The increase in net operating income for the first quarter 2005 is due to pricing actions taken to improve margins as well as a stabilization of investment yields.
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2005 net earned premiums decreased 9% to $121.2 million from $133.2 million in the same period of 2004 due to lower sales resulting from continued pricing discipline in a low interest rate environment.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the first quarter of 2005 increased by $2.0 million after tax compared to the first quarter of 2004 due to the finalization of the current debt structure during the first quarter of 2004. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2005 was $10.5 million, compared to a loss of $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2004. Expenses include stock-appreciation-rights costs and public company costs, including expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance.
Financial Position
March 31, 2005 total assets were $24.4 billion. In the first quarter of 2005, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $0.3 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2004.

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Safe Harbor Statement
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of
 
these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share have been included as a measure of 2004 operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. In 2005, earnings per share are based on actual average shares outstanding.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

We continue to deliver shareholder value through our diversified specialty insurance strategy and we remain well-positioned for future profitable growth.
In addition to these excellent financial results, highlights of the quarter included strengthening our management team and separating our Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions businesses to better position them for future profitable growth."

The second quarter of 2005 includes $9.4 million of investment income realized from a real estate partnership. Excluding this item, the yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.63% in the second

Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
 
 
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2005 net operating income was $58.6 million, up 52% from second quarter 2004 net operating income of $38.6 million. Net operating income for the first half of 2005 grew 44% to $113.3 million from $78.6 million in the first half of 2004. The net operating income increases are due to continued favorable loss experience in Assurant Specialty Property business, as well as growth in investment income and fee income from Assurant Solutions.
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2005 net earned premiums increased 4% to $636.7 million from $610.6 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2005 increased 1% to $1.25 billion from $1.23 billion in the first half of 2004. The increases are a result of growth in the specialty property and extended service contract businesses. Domestic credit insurance premiums continued to decline, offset by strong international growth. Gross written premiums grew for all products, except domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2005 net operating income increased 24% to $49.4 million from $39.9 million in the same period in 2004. Net operating income for the first half of 2005 grew 29% to $99.0 million from $76.6 million in the first half of 2004. The increases in net operating income were driven by low medical loss ratios resulting in an 89.5% combined ratio for the quarter.
Assurant Health second quarter 2005 net earned premiums of $544.3 million were down 3% from the same period in 2004. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2005 decreased 1% to $1.09 billion from $1.11 billion in the first half of 2004. Premium increases in the individual medical business which resulted from higher premiums per member were offset by membership declines in the small group business.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2005 net operating income decreased 30% to $9.8 million from net operating income of $14.0 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the first half of 2005 decreased 4% to $26.2 million from $27.3 million in the first half of 2004. Net operating income for the second quarter 2005 decreased primarily due to unfavorable disability experience, as a result of a decrease in claim closures caused largely by fewer deaths among disabled insureds.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2005 net earned premiums grew 2% to $316.4 million from $309.2 million in the same period of 2004. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2005 increased 6% to $662.3 million from $627.2 million in the first half of 2004. Net earned premium increases were primarily driven by higher disability premiums, including single premiums of $26.7 million in the first half of 2005
 
compared to $13.1 million in the same period of 2004 related to the assumption of closed blocks of disability claims.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2005 net operating income increased 27% to $12.8 million from net operating income of $10.1 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the first half of 2005 grew 19% to $19.8 million from $16.6 million in the first half of 2004. The increase in net operating income for the second quarter 2005 includes a $6.1 million (after tax) of investment income realized from a real estate partnership. Excluding this item, income would have been lower in the first half of 2005 due to continued low interest rate environment.
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2005 net earned premiums decreased 8% to $125.8 million from $136.3 million in the same period of 2004. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2005 decreased 8% to $247.0 million from $269.5 million in the first half of 2004. Declines were due to lower sales resulting from continued pricing discipline in a low interest rate environment.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses. Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2005 was $3.3 million, compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2004. The second quarter and six months of 2005 included a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to a tax clarification for taxes on repatriated capital under the American Jobs Creation Act. Expenses include stock-appreciation-rights costs and public company costs, including expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance.
Financial Position
June 30, 2005 total assets were $24.5 billion. In the second quarter of 2005, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $2.6 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2004.

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share have been included as a measure of 2004 operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion
 
of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. In 2005, earnings per share are based on actual average shares outstanding.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

1. Nature of Operations
          Assurant, Inc. (formerly Fortis, Inc.) (the "Company") is a holding company provider of specialized insurance products and related services in North America and selected international markets. Prior to the Initial Public Offering ("the IPO") Fortis, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada and was indirectly wholly owned by Fortis N.V. of the Netherlands and Fortis SA/NV of Belgium (collectively, "Fortis") through their affiliates, including their wholly owned subsidiary, Fortis Insurance N.V.
          On February 5, 2004, Fortis sold approximately 65% of its ownership interest in Assurant, Inc. via the IPO and retained approximately 35% of its ownership (50,199,130 shares). In connection with the IPO, Fortis, Inc. was merged into Assurant, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was formed solely for the purpose of the redomestication of Fortis, Inc. After the merger, Assurant, Inc. became the successor to the business, operations and obligations of Fortis, Inc. Assurant, Inc. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AIZ.
          The following events occurred in connection with the Company's IPO: (1) redeemed the outstanding $196,224 of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in January 2004, (2) issued 68,976 shares of Common Stock of Assurant, Inc. to certain directors and officers of the Company, and (3) issued 32,976,854 shares of Common Stock of Assurant, Inc. to Fortis Insurance N.V. simultaneously with the closing of the IPO in exchange for a $725,500 capital contribution based on the public offering price of the Company's common stock. The Company used the proceeds of the capital contribution to repay the $650,000 of outstanding indebtedness under the $650,000 senior bridge credit facility and $75,500 of outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility. The Company repaid a portion of the $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility with $49,500 in cash. On February 18, 2004, the Company refinanced $975,000 of the remaining $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility with the proceeds of the issuance of two senior long-term notes (See Note 4).
          On January 21, 2005, Fortis owned approximately 36% (50,199,130 shares) of the Company based on the number of shares outstanding that day and sold 27,200,000 of those shares in a secondary offering to the public. The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by Fortis. Fortis received all net proceeds from the sale. Fortis concurrently sold exchangeable bonds, due January 26, 2008, that are mandatorily exchangeable for their remaining 22,999,130 shares of Assurant. Fortis may elect, prior to the maturity date of the bonds, a cash settlement alternative and pay the bondholders an amount of cash equal to the applicable market value of the Company's common stock. The exchangeable bonds and the shares of the Company's common stock into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
          Through its operating subsidiaries, the Company provides creditor-placed homeowners insurance, manufactured housing homeowners insurance, debt protection administration, credit insurance, warranties and extended service contracts, individual health and small employer group health insurance, group dental insurance, group disability insurance, group life insurance and pre-funded funeral insurance.
2. Basis of Presentation
          The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
          In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of the financial statements have been included. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
          Dollar amounts are in thousands, except for number of shares and per share amounts.
Table of Contents
Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 (Unaudited)
 
          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
          Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2005. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
          In December 2004, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), ("FAS 123R'') which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, . FAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under FAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under FAS 123R, the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost, and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The permitted transition methods include either retrospective or prospective adoption. Under the retrospective option, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of FAS 123R. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule for public companies which delays the effective date of FAS 123R. Under the new rule, public companies are required to adopt FAS 123R in the first annual period after June 15, 2005, and, therefore, the Company is required to adopt FAS 123R by the first quarter of 2006. Except for this deferral of the effective date, the guidance in FAS 123R is unchanged. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 123R and the potential impact on the Company's financial statements.
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
          In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, ("FAS 154''). FAS 154 changes the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Prior to FAS 154, the majority of voluntary changes in
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements"
Table of Contents
Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 (Unaudited)
 
accounting principles were required to be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 but does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The Company does not believe the adoption of FAS 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
4. Debt
          In December 2003, the Company entered into two senior bridge credit facilities of $650,000 and $1,100,000. The aggregate indebtedness of $1,750,000 under the facility was in connection with the extinguishment of the Company's Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities. The $1,750,000 aggregate indebtedness under the senior bridge credit facility was paid in full in February 2004.
          In February 2004, the Company issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The Company received net proceeds from this transaction of $971,537, which represents the principal amount less the discount. The discount will be amortized over the life of the notes. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 5.63% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014 and was issued at a 0.11% discount. The second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.75% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034 and was issued at a 0.61% discount. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The senior notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The senior notes were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004 and all of the holders exchanged their notes for the new, registered notes.
          The interest expense incurred related to the senior notes was $15,047 and $15,548 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $30,094 and $22,236 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
          The Company maintains a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company's subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. In April 2005, the Company amended and restated its $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase Bank. The amended and restated credit facility is unsecured and is available until April 2010, so long as the Company is in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. On February 3, 2005, the Company used $40,000 from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, which was repaid on February 17, 2005. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at June 30, 2005. The Company did not use the revolving credit facility during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and no amounts are currently outstanding.
          The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that the Company maintain certain specified minimum ratios and thresholds. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and the Company maintains all specified minimum ratios and thresholds.

5. Stock Based Compensation
Long-Term Incentive Plan
          
Restricted Shares
          The Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of awards to employees, officers, and directors. The expense recorded related to restricted shares was $525 and $357 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $604 and $609 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
          
Stock Appreciation Rights Plan
          On April 7, 2005, the Company approved an amendment to the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan ("SARs Plan"). The amendment, which was effective June 30, 2005, amended the plan from one that paid appreciation to participants in the form of cash to a plan that pays appreciation to participants in the form of company stock. As a result of the amendment, 2,633,816 Assurant, Inc. rights and 568,937 business unit rights under the previous plan were converted into 4,726,384 rights under the amended SARs Plan at June 30, 2005. The intrinsic value of the converted rights did not change from that of the existing rights under the previous plan. Of the converted rights, approximately 43% are fully vested. The remainder will become fully vested over the next two years in accordance with their original vesting period. The conversion of the existing rights under the previous plan to the amended SARs Plan resulted in a $43,775 reclass of a liability to additional paid-in capital at June 30, 2005.
          Two additional grants were made under the SARs Plan during the period. On June 3, 2005, the Company granted 11,921 rights to its board of directors at an exercise price of $35.25 that were immediately vested and expensed. On June 30, 2005, the Company granted 1,051,641 rights to certain Company executives at an exercise price of $35.64. These shares have a three year cliff vesting period starting from January 1, 2005, and will be expensed over that period.
          Until adoption of FAS 123R (see Note 3), the Company will continue to account for the SARs Plan as a variable plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ("APB 25") and its interpretations. The SARs Plan meets the requirements for a compensatory plan, and accordingly the Company records an expense based on the intrinsic value.

Executive 401K Plan
          During 2005, the Company purchased 12,900 treasury shares for $438 via a Rabbi Trust which was allocated to the Assurant Stock Fund. See Note 6 for further information.
          
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
          The Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") which went into effect on July 1, 2004. In January 2005, the Company issued 71,860 shares to employees relating to the ESPP at a price of $23.67 for the offering period of July 1 through December 31, 2004. In July 2005, the Company issued 77,017 shares to employees relating to the ESPP at a price of $27.63 for the offering period of January 1 through June 30, 2005.
          The Company accounts for the ESPP in accordance with APB 25 as a non-compensatory plan, and accordingly does not record any compensation expense.
          The following pro forma information of net income and net income per share amounts were determined as if the Company had accounted for the ESPP and SARs Plans under the fair value method of FAS 123. This disclosure is not equivalent to the impact the Company will incur upon adoption of FAS 123R at January 1, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 123R.

7. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits
          The components of net periodic benefits cost for the Company's qualified pension benefits and post retirement plans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 were as follows:
          During the first three months of 2005, the Company contributed $40,000 and zero to the qualified pension plan and the retirement health benefit plan, respectively. This is consistent with the Company's projected contribution amounts disclosed in its 2004 Form 10-K. The Company made no contribution during the three months ended June 30, 2005. As a result of the $40,000 cash contribution to its qualified pension plan, the Company reversed $28,086, net of tax, representing a portion of the minimum pension liability, which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. An additional minimum pension liability of $9,485, net of tax, related to the non-qualified plan, remains within accumulated other comprehensive income.
          The Company's nonqualified plans are unfunded. The net periodic costs were $2,879 and $2,781 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $5,654 and $5,181 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

          The Company evaluates performance of the operating business segments based on segment income after-tax excluding realized gains (losses) on investments. The Company determines reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way the Company organizes for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance.
          On June 21, 2005, the Company announced its intention to separate Assurant Solutions into two businesses  Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions. The Company will begin reporting separate segment financial information sometime in 2006.

9. Commitments and Contingencies
          In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. The Company had $75,529 of letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2005.
          The Company is regularly involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. The Company may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to the Company's current and past business operations. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation, examination or investigation, the Company does not believe that any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
          The Solutions segment is subject to a number of pending actions, primarily in the State of Mississippi, many of which allege that the Company's credit insurance products were packaged and sold with lenders' products without buyer consent. The judicial climate in Mississippi is such that the outcome of these cases is extremely unpredictable. The Company has been advised by legal counsel that the Company has meritorious defenses to all claims being asserted against the Company. The Company believes, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued are adequate.
          In addition, another part of the Solutions segment, American Reliable Insurance Company ("ARIC"), participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non-disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims "spirals" devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and/or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program year were adequate. However, the Company's exposure under the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. In addition, disputes with two affiliated reinsurers involved in the 1996 and 1997 program years were settled by a commutation agreement. During the second quarter of 2005, loss accruals relating to the 1996 program year were strengthened by approximately $7,800. The Company believes, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate. This loss accrual is management's best estimate. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements the Company may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty.
          The Company was notified on August 26, 2004 that one of our employees is being investigated by the criminal division of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for responses he made to questions he was asked by the IRS relating to an approximately $18,000 tax reserve taken by the Company in 1999. At this stage, it would be speculative to predict the outcome of this investigation. However, it could result in a fine assessed against the employee and the Company, negative publicity for the Company or more serious sanctions.
     As disclosed in the Risk Factors section of the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, one of the Company's reinsurers thinks the Company should have been accounting for premiums ceded to them as a loan instead of as an expense. Based on the Company's investigation to date into this matter, the Company has concluded that there was a verbal side agreement with respect to one of the Company's reinsurers under its catastrophic reinsurance program, which has accounting implications that may impact previously reported financial statements. While management believes that the difference resulting from any alternative accounting treatment would be immaterial to the Company's financial position or results of operations, regulators may reach a different conclusion. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, premiums ceded to this reinsurer were $2,600, $1,500 and $500, respectively, and losses ceded were $10,000, $0, and $0, respectively. This contract expired in December of 2004 and was not renewed.
     As part of ongoing, industry-wide investigations, the Company has previously received subpoenas for information from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The areas of inquiry addressed to the Company include "certain loss mitigation products" and documents relating to the use of finite risk insurance. The Company has conducted an evaluation of the transactions that could potentially fall within the scope of the subpoenas, as defined by the authorities, and has provided information as requested. As previously reported, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors is conducting an investigation of the matters raised by the subpoenas and has retained independent counsel to assist them.
     The Audit Committee's continuing investigation has raised the question of whether certain current and former employees acted properly in connection with the above mentioned reinsurance arrangement. The Company is reassessing its controls and the appropriateness of its conclusion regarding their effectiveness. The Company has enhanced its internal controls regarding reinsurance and will continue to further evaluate its internal controls.
10. Subsequent Events
          On August 12, 2005, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share. The dividend will be payable on September 7, 2005 to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2005.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Reserves
Long Duration
          The following is a discussion of the process by which we determine one reserve for our major long duration product line.
          Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are
Table of Contents
selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends and are based on our experience and include a provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized as income in future years in a constant relationship to insurance in force.
          Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less Deferred Acquisition Costs ("DAC")) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for unfavorable deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any deficiency in excess of DAC would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. There were no premium deficiencies recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2005.
Short Duration
          For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported ("IBNR") reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products.
Group Disability and Group Term Life
          Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves.
          Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment.
Medical
          IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical cost inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix.
Property and Warranty
          Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor-placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer-tail coverages which we no longer write (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate
Table of Contents
ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case-incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices.
          We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate of reserves is selected from the middle to upper end of third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates.
Reinsurance
          We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing.
     
Loss Protection and Capital Management
          As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, which enables us to free up capital to enable us to write additional business.
          For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events.
          Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To minimize this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks.
     
Business Dispositions
          We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses to facilitate the transaction because the businesses share legal entities with business segments that we retain. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to divested business are still reflected in our balance sheet.
     
Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing
          The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business.
          A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions' reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the client's captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client-generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiary's domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance
Table of Contents
agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements.
Retirement and Other Employee Benefits
          We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long-term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short-term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants.
Critical Accounting Policies
          Our 2004 Form 10-K described the accounting policies that are critical to the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The accounting policies described in the 2004 Form 10-K were consistently applied to the consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2005.
          As stated in our 2004 Form 10K, we adopted FAS 142, , on January 1, 2002. As part of the adoption of FAS 142, we are required to test goodwill on an annual basis. We performed a January 1, 2005 impairment test during the first quarter and concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

          The following discussion provides a high level analysis of how the consolidated results were affected by our four operating business segments and our Corporate & other segment. Please see the results of operations discussions for each of these segments contained in this document for more detail analysis of the fluctuations.
For The Three Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Three Months Ended June 30, 2004.
Net Income
          Net income increased by $32,414, or 34%, to $127,624 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $95,210 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in net income was primarily due to increases in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily attributable to improved loss experience in their Specialty Property businesses and improved underwriting results and increased fee and investment income in their Consumer Protection businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily attributable to an improved loss ratio in their small employer group business, partially offset by a decline in members in both individual markets and small employer group business.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $35,140, or 2%, to $1,874,303 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $1,839,163 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to increases in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Employee Benefits partially offset by a decrease in Assurant Health. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations from their specialty property products of $14,968 and from their consumer protection products of $11,090. Also contributing to the increase in Assurant Solutions was an increase in net investment income of $7,394 and fee and other income of $5,120. The increase in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $7,261. The decrease in Assurant Health was primarily due to a decline in net earned premiums from their
Table of Contents
small employer group business of $31,914, partially offset by an increase in their individual markets business of $16,847.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses decreased by $8,915, or 1%, to $1,686,204 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $1,695,119 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in total expenses was primarily due to a decrease in Assurant Health partially offset by increases in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Employee Benefits. The decrease in Assurant Health was primarily due to a decrease in their loss ratio of 290 basis points from 64.1% to 61.2%. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily driven by an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $6,410. The increase at Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily driven by an increase in policyholder benefits of $12,695 and selling, underwriting and general expenses of $2,290.
For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Six Months Ended June 30, 2004.
Net Income
          Net income increased by $52,434, or 28%, to $242,022 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $189,588 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in net income was primarily due to increases in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health partially offset by a decrease in Corporate & other. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily attributable to improved loss experience in their Specialty Property businesses and increased fee and investment income in their Consumer Protection businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily attributable to an improved loss ratio in their small employer group business, partially offset by a decline in members in both individual markets and small employer group business. The decrease in Corporate & other was primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on investments and the continued decline in the amortization of deferred gains from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses. These declines were partially offset by the loss on the sale of our Workability division that was recognized in May 2004.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $37,586, or 1%, to $3,736,657 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $3,699,071 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in total revenues was driven by increases in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Employee Benefits partially offset by decreases in Assurant Health, Assurant PreNeed, and Corporate & other. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations from their specialty property products of $33,105, partially offset by a decrease from their consumer protection products of $14,865. Also contributing to the increase in Assurant Solutions was an increase in net investment income of $10,800 and fees and other income of $12,016. The increase in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $35,139 and net investment income of $3,098, partially offset by a decrease in fees and other income of $3,936 due to the sale of the Workability division in May 2004. The decrease in Assurant Health was primarily due to a decline in net earned premiums from their small employer group business of $54,896 partially offset by an increase in their individual markets business of $38,408. The decrease in Assurant PreNeed was primarily a result of a decrease in net earned premiums and other considerations of $22,469 and fees and other income of $2,552, partially offset by the increase in net investment income primarily due to $9,409 recognized from a real estate partnership. The decrease in Corporate & other was primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on investments of $15,375 and due to the continued decline in amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses of $5,112, offset by the non-recurring loss of $9,232 recognized in May of 2004 on the sale of the Workability division.

Total Expenses
          Total expenses decreased by $40,431 or 1%, to $3,371,835 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $3,412,266 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in total expenses was driven by decreases in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant PreNeed partially offset by an increase in Assurant Employee Benefits. The decrease in Assurant Solutions was largely driven by a decrease in policyholder benefits of $27,053 primarily attributable to improved loss experience from their Specialty Property businesses and decreased losses associated with the decline in their domestic credit insurance business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $14,449. The decrease in Assurant Health was primarily due to a decrease in their loss ratio of 240 basis points from 64.4% to 62.0%. The decrease in Assurant Preneed was primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $17,158. The increase in Assurant Employee Benefits was driven by an increase in policyholder benefits of $36,107.

Overview
          The tables below present information regarding Assurant Solutions' segment results of operations:
 
Table of Contents
For The Three Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Three Months Ended June 30, 2004.
Net Income
          Segment net income increased by $19,994, or 52%, to $58,562 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $38,568 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily attributable to improved loss experience and, to a lesser extent, higher net earned premiums in all of our Specialty Property businesses. Growth from our Consumer Protection businesses is also contributing to improved underwriting results, and an increase in fee income and investment income.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $38,572, or 6%, to $729,888 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $691,316 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $26,058. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our specialty property products increased $14,968 primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums from our creditor-placed homeowners insurance business. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our consumer protection products increased by $11,090, primarily due to higher net earned premiums in our extended service contract and international businesses. This increase was partially offset by the continued decline of our domestic credit insurance business. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in net investment income of $7,394. The increase was a result of an increase in the average portfolio yield of 56 basis points to 5.28% for the three months ended June 30, 2005, from 4.72% for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and the average invested assets increased by approximately 4%. Approximately $4,100 of the increase in net investment income was due to a non-recurring item during the second quarter of 2005. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fees and other income of $5,120, or 14%, mainly due to an increase from our debt deferment and extended service contract products.
          We experienced steady growth in all of our core product groupings, with the exception of our domestic credit insurance business. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit insurance business decreased by $16,975 due to the continued decline of this product line. Gross written premiums from our international credit business increased by $17,471, primarily due to our focus on international expansion. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract business increased by $29,351, due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract business increased by $39,495, primarily due to the signing of a new client in Canada in 2004. Gross written premiums from our specialty property solutions products increased by $20,581, primarily due to growth in our manufactured housing homeowners insurance products.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses increased by $7,668, or 1%, to $642,270 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $634,602 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This increase was partly due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $1,258. This small increase, in relation to the related larger increase in net earned premiums, was primarily attributable to improved loss experience from our Specialty Property businesses. Additionally there were decreased losses associated with the decline of our domestic credit insurance business. The majority of the increase in expenses was due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $6,410. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $2,644 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues, partially offset by lower premium taxes attributable to the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $3,766, primarily due to higher expenses attributable to general business growth, partially offset by productivity gain initiatives in our credit insurance product line.

Net Income
          Segment net income increased by $34,711, or 44%, to $113,332 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $78,621 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily attributable to improved loss experience and, to a lesser extent, higher net earned premiums in all of our Specialty Property businesses. Growth from our Consumer Protection businesses is contributing to an increase in fee income and investment income.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $41,056, or 3%, to $1,429,403 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $1,388,347 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $18,240. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our specialty property products increased by $33,105, primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums in our creditor-placed homeowners insurance business. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our consumer protection products decreased by $14,865, primarily from the continued decline of our domestic credit insurance business, partially offset by higher net earned premiums in our international business. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in net investment income of $10,800. The increase was a result of an increase in the average portfolio yield of 36 basis points to 5.07% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, from 4.71% for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and the average invested assets increased by approximately 4%. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fees and other income of $12,016, or 18%, mainly due to an increase in fees related to growth from debt deferment and extended service contracts products.
          We experienced steady growth in all of our core product groupings, with the exception of our domestic credit insurance business. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit insurance business decreased by $62,737 due to the continued decline of this product line. Gross written premiums from our international credit business increased by $51,627 due to our focus on international expansion. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract business increased by $19,267 due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract business increased by $76,368, primarily due to the signing of a new client in Canada in 2004. Gross written premiums from our specialty property products increased by $16,865 primarily due to growth in our manufactured housing homeowners insurance products.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses decreased by $12,604 or 1%, to $1,260,124 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $1,272,728 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. This decrease was largely driven by a decrease in policyholder benefits of $27,053. The decrease was primarily attributable to improved loss experience from our Specialty Property businesses and decreased losses associated with the decline of our domestic credit insurance business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $14,449. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $12,215 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues, partially offset by lower premium taxes attributable to the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $2,234, primarily due to higher expenses attributable to general business growth, partially offset by productivity gain initiatives in our credit insurance product line.

Net Income
          Segment net income increased by $9,432, or 24%, to $49,367 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, from $39,935 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an improved loss ratio in our small employer group business, partially offset by a decline in members in both individual markets and small employer group business due to increased competition.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues decreased by $15,378, or 3%, to $571,734 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, from $587,112 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased by $16,847 primarily due to premium rate increases partially offset by a decline in members. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased by $31,914 due to a decline in members partially offset by premium rate increases. Both individual markets and the small employer group business have experienced decreases in new business written primarily due to increased competition in their respective markets.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses decreased by $29,996, or 6%, to $496,486 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, from $526,482 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The loss ratio decreased by 290 basis points, from 64.1% to 61.2%. The expense ratio increased by 10 basis points, from 29.4% to 29.5%. The decrease in expenses and the loss ratio was largely due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $25,628 due to the overall decline in members and favorable large claims experience in the small employer group business. The decrease in expenses was also due to a decrease in selling, general and underwriting expenses of $4,368 primarily due to a decline in first year business in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting in decreased commission expense and other acquisition costs in both individual markets and small employer group business

          Segment net income increased by $22,397, or 29%, to $99,040 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, from $76,643 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an improved loss ratio in our small employer group business, partially offset by a decline in members in both individual markets and small employer group business due to increased competition.

          Total revenues decreased by $15,065, or 1%, to $1,149,296 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, from $1,164,361 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased by $38,408 primarily due to premium rate increases partially offset by a decline in members. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased by $54,896 due to a decline in members partially offset by premium rate increases. Both individual markets and the small employer group business have experienced decreases in new business written primarily due to increased competition in their respective markets.

          Total expenses decreased by $49,381, or 5%, to $998,617 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, from $1,047,998 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The loss ratio decreased by 240 basis points, from 64.4% to 62.0%. The expense ratio decreased by 80 basis points, from 29.5% to 28.7%. The decrease in expenses and the loss ratio was largely due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $36,375 due to the overall decline in members and favorable large claims experience in the small employer group business.

For The Three Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Three Months Ended June 30, 2004.
Net Income
          Segment net income decreased by $4,214, or 30%, to $9,812 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $14,026 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits driven largely by reduced disability claim closures due to death.
Table of Contents
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $8,357, or 2%, to $361,687 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $353,330 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $7,261, due to growth in disability business written through alternate distribution sources, as well as increased sales in our group disability and group life products.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses increased by $14,985, or 5%, to $346,564 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $331,579 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The loss ratio increased by 230 basis points, from 74.0% to 76.3%. The expense ratio remained unchanged at 32.5%. The increase in expenses and the loss ratio was largely due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $12,695 driven by reduced disability claim closures due to death, and an increase in business written through alternate distribution sources. Also contributing to the increase in expenses was an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $2,290 driven by an increase in technology-related costs, partially offset by lower expenses due to the sale of the Workability division in May 2004.
For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Six Months Ended June 30, 2004.
Net Income
          Segment net income decreased by $1,085, or 4%, to $26,191 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $27,276 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in segment income was largely due to an increase in policyholder benefits driven largely by reduced disability claim closures. While disability claim closures due to claimant recovery are similar between 2004 and 2005, closures due to death are lower in 2005. Unfavorable group dental experience as a result of the competitive dental market also contributed to the increase in policyholder benefits, partially offset by favorable development in group life mortality.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $34,301, or 5%, to $751,781 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $717,480 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $35,139, due to growth in disability business written through alternate distribution sources, including an increase of $13,597 for single premiums related to risk for closed blocks of disability business, as well as increased sales in our group disability and group life products. Net investment income increased by $3,098 due to an increase in the average invested assets of approximately 2%, and an increase in the average portfolio yield of 11 basis points to 6.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from 6.06% for the six months ended June 30, 2004. Fees and other income decreased $3,936 due to the sale of the Workability division in May 2004.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses increased by $36,069, or 5%, to $711,319 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $675,250 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The loss ratio increased by 150 basis points from 75.4% to 76.9%. The expense ratio decreased by 150 basis points from 31.4% to 29.9%. The increase in expenses and the loss ratio was largely due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $36,107 driven primarily by reduced disability claim closures due to death, and an increase in business written through alternate distribution sources, including an increase of $13,265 due to the assumption of risk related to closed blocks of business. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to level expenses compared to increased net earned premiums. The level expenses are the result of lower expenses in 2005 due to the sale of the Workability division in May 2004 and a non-recurring reduction in short-term incentive compensation in March 2005 partially offset by an increase in technology related costs.

Net Income
          Segment income after tax increased by $2,701 or 27% to $12,840 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $10,139 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase is principally due to an increase in investment income. During the three months ended June 30, 2005, we recognized $6,116 (after-tax) of additional investment income from a real estate partnership. This increase was partially offset by a decline in the value of the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") cap, a derivative instrument, an increase in death claim incidence, and higher growth paid on CPI indexed products.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues decreased by $1,957, or 1%, to $188,329 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $190,286 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in net earned premiums and other considerations of $10,486 due to a decline in sales of life policies. Sales at AMLIC have declined due to changes in the sales force structure at SCI, AMLIC's principal customer. Independent-United States sales have declined as a result of continued pricing discipline on certain new business, resulting in the loss of several large customers. Life and annuity sales in Canada increased due to higher sales to national accounts. Additionally, fees and other income decreased $1,690 primarily due to a decline in the value of the CPI cap. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in net investment income primarily due to $9,409 from a real estate partnership.

Total Expenses
          Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $6,021 or 3%, to $168,632 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $174,653 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This was a result of a decrease in policyholder benefits of $7,363 primarily due to a decline in sales of life policies. This decrease was partially offset by increases in selling, underwriting and general expenses due to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs.
For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to The Six Months Ended June 30, 2004.

          Segment income after tax increased by $3,201, or 19% to $19,796 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $16,595 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase is principally due to an increase in investment income realized from a real estate partnership. The increase was partially offset by a decline in the value of the CPI cap, an increase in death claim incidence, and higher growth paid on CPI indexed products.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues decreased by $11,967 or 3%, to $363,719 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $375,686 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in net earned premiums and other considerations of $22,469 due to a decline in sales of life policies. Sales at AMLIC have declined due to changes in the sales force structure at SCI, AMLIC's principal customer. Independent-United States sales have declined as a result of continued pricing discipline on certain new business, resulting in the loss of several large customers. Life and annuity sales in Canada increased due to higher sales to national accounts. Additionally, fees and other income decreased $2,552 primarily due to a decline in the value of the CPI cap. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in net investment income primarily due to $9,409 from a real estate partnership. The remaining increase in net investment income is the result of an increase in the average invested assets of approximately 8%, partially offset by a decline in the average portfolio yield (excluding the net proceeds from the real estate joint venture transaction) of 24 basis points. The average portfolio yield decreased to 6.22 % for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from 6.46% for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
Total Expenses
          Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $16,798, or 5%, to $333,316 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $350,114 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $17,158 due to a decline in sales of life policies.
Assurant Corporate & Other
Overview
          The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments and interest income earned from short-term investments held. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of Fortis Financial Group (FFG) (a business we sold via reinsurance on April 2, 2001) and Long Term Care (LTC) (a business we sold via reinsurance on March 1, 2000).

Net Loss
          Segment net loss decreased by $4,501, or 60%, to $2,957 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $7,458 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the loss on the sale of our Workability business that was recognized in May of 2004 partially offset by the continued decline in the amortization of deferred gains from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues increased by $5,546, or 32%, to $22,665 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $17,119 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to the non-recurring loss of $9,232 recognized in May of 2004 on the sale of the Workability division. The increase was partially offset by the continued decline in amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses of $2,478 and the decline in net realized gains on investment of $1,643 due to market conditions.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses increased by $4,449, or 16%, to $32,252 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $27,803 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increased compensation expense on stock appreciation rights plans, resulting from growth in our stock price during the period.

Net Loss
          Segment net loss increased by $6,790, or 71%, to $16,337 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $9,547 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on investments and the continued decline in the amortization of deferred gains from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses. These declines were partially offset by the non-recurring loss on the sale of our Workability business that was recognized in May 2004.
Total Revenues
          Total revenues decreased by $10,739, or 20%, to $42,458 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $53,197 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on investments of $15,375 due to market conditions and the continued decline in amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of the FFG and LTC businesses. These declines were offset by the non-recurring loss of $9,232 recognized in May of 2004 on the sale of the Workability division.
Total Expenses
          Total expenses increased by $2,283, or 3%, to $68,459 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $66,176 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in expenses was primarily due to a full six months of interest expense on our long-term debt compared to approximately four months in 2004.
Investments
          The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated:
          Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 68% and 67% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated "A" or better as of June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.
          The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (pre-tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated:
Table of Contents
          Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $65,189, or 13%, from December 31, 2004 to June 30, 2005. The increase in net unrealized gains on fixed maturities was primarily due to a 30 basis points decrease in the 10 year treasury yields. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $6,223, or 44%, from December 31, 2004 to June 30, 2005. The decrease in net unrealized gains on equity securities was primarily due to a 1% drop in the market value of preferred securities from December 31, 2004 to June 30, 2005 in the Merrill Lynch Preferred Stock Hybrid Securities Index.
          The investment category of the Company's gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at June 30, 2005 and the length of time the securities have been in an unrealized loss position were as follows (in thousands):
          The total unrealized loss represents less than 2% of the aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately 65% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 650 individual securities with 98% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $200. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than six months but less than 12 months were approximately $5,062, with no security with a unrealized loss of greater than $200 having a market value below 83% of book value.
          As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis fashion and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and record $900 and $817 of additional other than temporary impairments as of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, respectively. Due to issuers' continued satisfaction of the securities' obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers' financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2005 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased.
          Net investment income increased by $19,390, or 12.3%, to $177,018 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $157,628 for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and increased by $29,766, or 9.6%, to $341,218 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from $311,452 for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The increases were primarily due to an increase in invested assets and investment yields. The average portfolio yield increased by 6 basis points to 5.63% for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from 5.57% for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and increased by 9 basis points to 5.57% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from 5.48% for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The average invested assets increased by approximately 5% for the same periods year over year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
          Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2005, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval is approximately $364,000.
          Dividends paid by our subsidiaries were $94,800 and $361,730 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, and for the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively. We use these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, and to repurchase our outstanding shares.
          The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries' excess funds in order to generate income.
           On August 12, 2005, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share. The dividend will be payable on September 7, 2005 to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2005. We paid dividends of $0.07 per common share on March 14, 2005 to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2005. We also paid dividends of $0.08 per common share on June 7, 2005, to shareholders of record as of May 23, 2005. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries' payment of dividends and/or other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
          Our qualified pension plan was under-funded by $57,400 at December 31, 2004. We contributed $40,000 as of March 31, 2005 and reduced the under-funded status of our qualified pension plan. We do not expect to make any additional contributions for the remainder of 2005. See Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the components of the net periodic benefit cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.
          The Company maintains a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. In April 2005, we amended and restated our $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase Bank. The amended and restated credit facility is unsecured and is available until April 2010, so long as the Company is in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at June 30, 2005. We did not use the revolving credit facility during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and no amounts are outstanding.
Table of Contents
          The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. We are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds.
          On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034.
          Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
          In management's opinion, our subsidiaries' cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business.
Cash Flows
          We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  November 3, 2005  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the third quarter 2005 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.
J. Kerry Clayton, Chief Executive Officer, said: "We saw strong growth in net operating income despite the worst hurricane season on record. We continue to grow profits, increase shareholder value and improve ROE through our diversified specialty insurance strategy. "
Third Quarter Results
Net income in the third quarter of 2005 was $100.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, versus third quarter 2004 net income of $74.8 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the third quarter of 2005 increased 71% to $125.6 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2004 net operating income of $73.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Net operating income excludes investment gains or losses and other unusual items including a $35.1 million after-tax charge for the 1995-1997 excess of loss reinsurance program. Recently, the company settled with one of the largest reinsureds in the program, did not prevail in an arbitration with another reinsurer, and strengthened reserves for remaining exposures in the program.
Net earned premiums of $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2005 increased 1% from the same period in 2004.
 
Net investment income in the third quarter of 2005 increased to $175.2 million from $160.0 million in the third quarter of 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in invested assets. The third quarter of 2005 includes $3.2 million of investment income realized from real estate partnerships. Excluding this item, the yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.71% in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 5.56% in the third quarter of 2004.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first three quarters of 2005 was $342.3 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, versus the first three quarters of 2004 net income of $264.4 million, or $1.86 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release).
Net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 increased 43% to $370.8 million, or $2.67 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $258.4 million, or $1.82 per pro forma share in the same period of the prior year. Net operating income excludes investment gains or losses and other unusual items. The after tax charge of $40.3 million for the 1995-1997 excess of loss reinsurance program includes $5.2 million that had previously been reported in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property in the second quarter of 2005.
Net earned premiums increased 1% to $4.9 billion in the first three quarters of 2005 from $4.8 billion for the same period in 2004.
Net investment income in the first three quarters of 2005 increased to $516.4 million from $471.5 million in the first three quarters of 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in invested assets. Excluding $12.6 million of investment income from real estate partnerships recorded in the second and third quarters, the yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.57% in the first three quarters of 2005, compared to 5.47% in the first three quarters of 2004.
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
 
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2005 net operating income was $53.1 million, up significantly from third quarter 2004 net operating income of $3.0 million. Net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 grew 110% to $171.7 million from $81.6 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Net operating income for both the third quarter 2005 and 2004 includes four catastrophes. 2005 catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $31.1 million were lower than 2004 losses of $75.5 million as a result of the differing severity and location of the hurricanes, and reinsurance programs in place during the respective years. Excluding the catastrophe losses, Assurant's Specialty Property business continues to have favorable loss experience. These businesses also benefited from higher investment income and fee income. In addition, favorable settlements related to commissions and claims payable from three clients, two of which previously declared bankruptcy, contributed $6.5 million after tax to the quarter and $11.1 million to the nine months of 2005.
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2005 net earned premiums increased 8% to $648.0 million from $602.7 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first three quarters of 2005 increased 3% to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion in the first three quarters of 2004. The increases are a result of continued growth in the specialty property and extended service contract businesses and strong international growth. Gross written premiums continue to grow for all core products with the exception of domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2005 net operating income of $45.7 million was down 5% from $47.9 million in 2004. Net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 grew 16% to $144.8 million from $124.5 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Strong net operating income resulted from continued low combined ratios of 90.6% for the quarter and 89.9% for the nine months.
Assurant Health third quarter 2005 net earned premiums of $538.8 million were down 4% from the same period in 2004. Net earned premiums in the first three quarters of 2005 decreased 2% to $1.6 billion from $1.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2004 due to a decline in membership in both the individual medical and small group businesses. Premiums increased in the individual medical business as a result of higher premiums per member.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2005 net operating income increased 53% to $22.8 million from net operating income of $15.0 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 increased 16% to $49.0 million from
 
$42.2 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Increases in net operating income were primarily due to improved group life mortality and favorable disability experience.
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2005 net earned premiums were essentially flat at $306.9 million compared to the same period of 2004. Net earned premiums in the first three quarters of 2005 increased 4% to $969.3 million from $933.0 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Net earned premium increases were primarily driven by growth in disability business and improved persistency in group disability and life. Disability premiums include single premiums of $26.7 million in the first three quarters of 2005 compared to $13.1 million in the same period of 2004 related to the assumption of closed blocks of disability claims.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2005 net operating income increased 17% to $10.5 million from net operating income of $8.9 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 grew 19% to $30.3 million from $25.5 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Net operating income benefited from higher investment income, including $6.1 million after tax realized from a real estate partnership in the second quarter of 2005.
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2005 net earned premiums decreased 3% to $127.4 million from $131.8 million in the same period of 2004. Net earned premiums in the first three quarters of 2005 decreased 7% to $374.5 million from $401.3 million in the first three quarters of 2004. Premium declines are the result of lower sales in the U.S. partially offset by increases in Canada.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses. Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2005 was $4.1 million, compared to a loss of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2004. Expenses include stock-appreciation-rights costs and expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance.
Financial Position
September 30, 2005 total assets were $25.4 billion. In the third quarter of 2005, net capital gains were $9.8 million after-tax compared to net capital gains of $1.6 million after-tax in the third quarter of 2004.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
 
(1) Pro forma earnings per share have been included as a measure of 2004 operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. In 2005, earnings per share are based on actual average shares outstanding.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release.

These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK  November 14, 2005  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that it will realign its funeral pre-funding and preplanning business segment, Assurant Preneed, under its Assurant Solutions business segment.
As part of the realignment, Assurant plans to pursue growth opportunities for Preneed by leveraging Assurant Solutions' expertise in developing and managing its relationship with Service Corporation International (NYSE: SCI), as well as its international expansion strategy.
"Realigning our preneed business will allow us to sharpen our focus on pursuing profitable growth opportunities for Preneed through our exclusive U.S. distribution partnership with Service Corporation International (SCI), by expanding our international preneed operations in Canada, and by developing and marketing innovative new products," said Kerry Clayton, chief executive officer, Assurant. "This reaffirms our commitment to shareholders and customers to make the right strategic choices for our businesses."
In conjunction with the decision, Assurant also announced that it has signed an agreement with Forethought Financial Services, Inc. ("Forethought") whereby Assurant will discontinue writing new preneed insurance policies in the United States except through funeral homes owned by SCI. As part of the agreement, Assurant Preneed's account executives who work with the independent funeral home channel will partner with Forethought to promote their preneed products. In exchange, Assurant will receive payments from Forethought over the next ten years.
 
Assurant estimates that the transaction will not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
"We are delighted to partner with Assurant Preneed and have our products distributed through its sales force," said Steve Lang, president and chief executive officer, Forethought Financial Services, Inc. "Our two companies have demonstrated significant leadership in the preneed marketplace over the past 20 years and have shared a common commitment to preneed and the funeral home channel. This agreement strengthens Forethought's presence in the independent segment, and we are very excited about the opportunity to expand the network of funeral homes that will have access to our broad range of exceptional products and services. Clearly funeral homes have a choice of preneed suppliers and it will be our purpose during this transition period to demonstrate that Forethought is the right choice for them."
"In partnering with Forethought and using our independent distribution channel sales force to promote their products, we are ensuring that our funeral home customers will continue to have access to quality products and excellent service from a highly respected company," said Alan Feagin, president and chief executive officer, Assurant Preneed.
To ensure a smooth transition for its current independent funeral home customers, Assurant Preneed account executives will be able to continue to market Assurant's preneed products until customers are re-contracted and fully licensed to sell Forethought products. Any preneed policies sold under the Assurant name during this period will be reinsured to Forethought Life Insurance Company.
Assurant will retain all of its preneed life insurance underwriting companies. These companies include: American Memorial Life Insurance Company, Union Security Insurance Company and United Family Life Insurance Company. As a result, policyholder and customer service on in-force preneed policies will continue to be handled by customer service representatives in Rapid City, S.D. and Greenville, S.C.
Feagin will oversee the transition of Assurant's preneed operations until his anticipated retirement in 2006. The new preneed line within the Assurant Solutions business will report to Craig Lemasters, Assurant Solutions' president and chief executive officer.

Table of Contents
Item 1.01 Entry Into and Amendment of Material Definitive Agreements
     On December 8, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") established incentive award targets and annual base salaries for fiscal year 2006 and authorized an amendment to and extension of the Change in Control Severance Agreements for the named executive officers.
     The Committee established target long-term awards under the Assurant Long Term Incentive Plan ("ALTIP") and target short-term incentive awards under the Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") for the named executive officers for fiscal year 2006. The target awards are expressed as a percentage of base salary for various performance levels. Actual long-term and short-term awards payable (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds, or falls short of applicable performance criteria. The performance criteria for fiscal year 2006 have not yet been set and will be determined by the Committee at a subsequent meeting.
     For the short-term incentive awards, performance against the criteria is generally measured on a five-point scale, as follows:
As provided in the Plan, the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion to increase or reduce the amount payable, regardless of the achievement of performance criteria.
     The annual long-term awards under the ALTIP will consist (i) 25% of restricted stock, which will vest one-third each year on the anniversary of the date of grant, and (ii) 75% of stock appreciation rights, which will vest as of December 31, 2008. All stock appreciation rights awarded will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock, net of basic taxes. The Company may settle fractional shares in cash.
     On December 8, 2005, the Compensation Committee also approved the 2006 annual base salaries for Assurant's named executive officers. The following table sets forth the annual base salary and target long-term and short-term incentive awards for each named executive officer in 2006:
Table of Contents
     On December 8, 2005, the Committee authorized the Company to amend (as described below) and extend the term (through December 31, 2006) of its existing Change in Control Severance Agreements ("CIC Agreements") with several officers, including the named executive officers, effective as of January 1, 2006.
     The CIC Agreements generally provide that if a change in control (as defined) occurs with respect to Assurant, Inc. for certain employees, and with respect to the business segment for which an employee works for others, then a two-year trigger period begins. If the employee's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or if the employee resigns for good reason (each as defined) during such two-year period, the employee is entitled to certain cash severance payments and continuation of medical and other welfare benefits for a period of 18 months following the termination of employment at the rate charged active employees.
     The amount of cash severance benefits payable to an employee is equal to a multiple (ranging from 1 to 3 depending on the agreement) times the sum of the employee's annual base salary and target annual bonus. The multiple for each of the Company's named executive officers, who are listed above, is 3. The cash severance for all employees is payable in a lump sum after employee's employment is terminated.
     In addition, an employee is entitled to the cash severance and continuation of welfare benefits if a change of control occurs and the employee's employment was terminated by the Company without cause (or the employee resigned for good reason) within one year prior to the change in control, in each case in anticipation of the change of control (as defined). In this case, the cash severance will be paid in a lump sum after the date on which the change of control occurs, and the Company will reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining continued welfare benefits between the date of termination and the date of the change of control.
     The agreements also provide additional rights including, but not limited to, outplacement services, legal fee reimbursement and reimbursement for any excise tax imposed on the employee by section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Tax Gross-Up"). On December 8, the Committee authorized the Company to amend the Tax Gross-Up provision in each CIC Agreement, effective January 1, 2006, to reduce the amount of the reimbursement to an employee, by up to 5% of the aggregate reimbursement, if such reduction would prevent the application of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code to the CIC Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, January 23, 2006  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that its chief executive officer, J. Kerry Clayton, 60, plans to retire and that Robert B. Pollock, 51, Assurant's president and chief operating officer, has been named president and chief executive officer and has been appointed to the company's board of directors effective March 17, 2006.
Mr. Clayton, who has served as Assurant's CEO since 2000, will retire as CEO on March 17, 2006. He will continue to serve on the company's board of directors in the newly created position of vice chairman from March 17 until the end of 2006. In this role, he will work with the chairman and the board in the areas of corporate governance and strategic planning.
"It's said that the best time to step aside is when your successor is in place and the company is well-positioned strategically and financially to deliver on its commitments to shareholders. I believe that is where Assurant is today," said Mr. Clayton. "I had previously expressed to the board of directors my hopes to retire some time after my 60 birthday. To ensure a smooth transition, we determined that the first quarter of this year would be the best time to appoint Rob as CEO."
th
"Rob Pollock is an accomplished executive who has been with Assurant for 25 years. He is a highly respected leader within the organization and among the members of our board of directors," continued Mr. Clayton. "He has been right there with me and the rest of the management team in leading Assurant since our initial public offering in February 2004. He has also earned the trust and respect of our shareholders. I can think of no one more capable of leading Assurant and building upon its success than Rob."
 
"I am thrilled about the opportunity to serve as Assurant's next CEO and appreciative of the board's support. I am excited about our prospects to build upon the proven strength of our diversified specialty insurance strategy," said Mr. Pollock. "Under Kerry's leadership and thanks to the efforts of our 12,000 employees and the customers and partners they serve, we can be proud of our accomplishments. Since our IPO, our market value has doubled and we've delivered excellent financial results in each and every quarter. We have also achieved top quartile return on equity within our industry. We also know that we have many opportunities before us which will allow us to continue to grow our business."
Mr. Pollock joined Assurant in 1981. Prior to assuming the role of president and chief operating officer in June 2005, he was executive vice president and chief financial officer of Assurant. He previously served as president and chief executive officer of Assurant Employee Benefits in Kansas City, Missouri.
Chairman of the Board John M. Palms, said: "The board is very pleased with the results that the company has achieved under Kerry's and Rob's leadership. As a board, one of the greatest responsibilities we have to the company and its shareholders is to ensure that a thorough, rigorous succession planning process is in place. We have great confidence in Rob as he assumes his new role as president and CEO, and in the rest of the Assurant management team."
Mr. Clayton added: "I have had a very full career with Assurant and recently celebrated my 35 anniversary with the company (and its predecessor companies). I am proud to turn over my CEO duties to Rob, an exceptional professional colleague and a friend whom I've known for more than 20 years."
th
The company's board of directors, upon Mr. Clayton's retirement from the board at the end of 2006, intends to elect an additional independent director. The board does not plan to elect a new vice chairman.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  February 9, 2006  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
J. Kerry Clayton, Chief Executive Officer, said: "For the two years since our IPO, we have produced strong growth in net operating income. Particularly notable are the strong results of Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property despite the significant hurricane seasons of the past two years. Assurant continues to not only grow profits but to significantly improve its operating ROE to 15.1% thus increasing shareholder value through our diversified specialty insurance strategy. In a nutshell, we achieved a solid fourth quarter, had a successful year and have a promising future."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $137.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, a 59% increase over fourth quarter 2004 net income of $86.1 million, or $0.61 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 2 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 65% to $142.4 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2004 net operating income of $86.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share.
 
Net earned premiums of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 were comparable to the same period in 2004.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased to $170.9 million from $163.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.54% in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 5.55% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Twelve-Month Results
Net income in 2005 was $479.4 million, or $3.50 per diluted share, a 37% increase over 2004 net income of $350.6 million, or $2.48 per pro forma share (see footnote 1 at the end of this release).
Net operating income for the twelve months of 2005 increased 49% to $513.3 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $345.0 million, or $2.44 per pro forma share in the same period of the prior year.
Net earned premiums were unchanged at $6.5 billion in 2005 compared with the prior year.
Net investment income in the twelve months of 2005 increased to $687.3 million from $634.7 million in the twelve months of 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in invested assets and increases in short term yields. Excluding $12.6 million of investment income from real estate partnerships recorded in the second and third quarters, the yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.54% for 2005, compared to 5.46% for 2004.
Robert B. Pollock, President and Chief Operating Officer, said: "All of our specialty insurance businesses produced year over year earnings growth. Our disciplined approach to revenue growth is starting to show positive results, especially in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property."
 
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2005 net operating income was $69.6 million, up 56% from fourth quarter 2004 net operating income of $44.6 million. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2005 grew significantly (91%) to $241.3 million from $126.2 million in the twelve months of 2004. Net operating income in the fourth quarter includes $17.6 million pre-tax of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, compared to $16.0 million pre-tax in the same period in 2004. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, for the year were $48.7 million pre-tax compared to $93.1 million pre-tax in 2004. The decrease was a result of the different severity of losses from each storm and the change in composition of reinsurance coverage in 2005. The fourth quarter also includes $17.4 million pre-tax of reimbursements received for processing and adjudication services under the National Flood Insurance Program. Excluding the catastrophe losses, Assurant Specialty Property continues to have favorable combined ratios for the quarter and the year. Both businesses also benefited from higher investment income and fee income. Full year results also include favorable settlements related to commissions and claims payable of $17.1 million pre-tax reported in earlier quarters.
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2005 net earned premiums increased 16% to $713.1 million from $612.2 million in the same year-ago
 
period. Net earned premiums in the twelve months of 2005 increased 7% to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion in the twelve months of 2004. Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter of 2005 were reduced by $9 million of additional reinsurance premiums related to the hurricanes and $26 million for the year. Premium increases for the quarter and year are primarily a result of continued growth in specialty property and extended service contracts in the US and overseas.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2005 net operating income of $33.3 million was down 1% from $33.7 million in 2004. Expense ratios in the fourth quarter of both years reflected higher than normal information technology and direct to consumer marketing expenses of $10 million pre-tax in 2005 and $13.5 million pre-tax in 2004. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2005 grew 12% to $178.1 million from $158.3 million in the twelve months of 2004. Strong net operating income in 2005 was the result of the lowest ever annual combined ratio of 90.8% versus an also excellent 92.4% combined ratio for 2004.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2005 net earned premiums of $531.3 million were down 5% from the same period in 2004. Net earned premiums in the twelve months of 2005 decreased 3% to $2.2 billion from the twelve months of 2004 primarily due to a decline in both premiums and membership in small group. Premiums increased in the individual medical business as a result of higher premiums per member offsetting a modest decline in membership.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2005 net operating income decreased 3% to $19.3 million from net operating income of $20.0 million in the same period of 2004. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2005 increased 10% to $68.4 million from $62.2 million in the twelve months of 2004. The increase in net operating income for the year is primarily a result of improved loss experience.
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2005 net earned premiums decreased 10% to $308.6 million from $343.8 million in the same year-ago period. The fourth quarter of 2004 included an assumption of $27.8 million of a closed block of business. Net earned premiums in the twelve months of 2005 were essentially unchanged at $1.3 billion.
Assurant Preneed
Fourth quarter 2005 net operating income decreased 45% to $4.8 million from net operating income of $8.7 million in the same period of 2004, primarily as a result of the announced sale of Assurant Preneed's U.S. independent funeral home franchise. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes $5.8 million pre-tax of transaction costs related to the sale. Net operating income for the twelve months of 2005 grew 2% to $35.1 million from $34.2 million in 2004. Net operating income benefited from higher investment income,
 
including $9.4 million pre-tax of income from real estate partnerships in the second quarter of 2005.
Assurant Preneed fourth quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 27% to $91.5 million from $124.8 million in the same period of 2004. Net earned premiums in the twelve months of 2005 decreased 11% to $466.0 million from $526.1 million in the twelve months of 2004. Premium declines are primarily the result of the sale of Assurant Preneed's domestic independent funeral home franchise combined with continued pricing discipline.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance was reduced by $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to reflect a cumulative adjustment for the slower than originally expected run off of the policies sold. Otherwise, it declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses. Corporate and other net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $20.7 million, compared to a loss of $19.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Corporate income for the year totaled $2.7 million compared to a loss of $35.3 million in 2004. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes $39.4 million of tax releases and adjustments resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits. For the full year, tax benefits and adjustments were $44.9 million. The fourth quarter and year 2004 included $9 million of net tax charges.
Financial Position
December 31, 2005 total assets were $25.4 billion. Stockholders equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $3.5 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 11% to $26.25 from $23.57 at December 31, 2004.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share have been included as a measure of 2004 operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better
 
indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share. In 2005, earnings per share are based on actual average shares outstanding.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income and operating return on equity (operating ROE) as important measures of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. Operating ROE is equal to net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. The company believes net operating income and operating ROE provide investors valuable measures of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because they exclude both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Safe Harbor Statement:
Some of the statements included in this statistical supplement, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, posted on the Assurant website at www.assurant.com.
 
Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants. These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.

     On December 13, 2005, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission setting forth the 2006 short term and long term incentive award targets that the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors had established for executive officers.
     On February 15, 2006, the Committee approved the performance criteria that will be used to measure whether the 2006 incentive award targets were achieved. The Committee will determine the final value of 2006 incentive awards based on the following factors and their respective weights: (a) earnings per share, determined using net operating income, (for those in an Operating Segment ("Segment"), net operating income of the Segment)  25%; (b) return on equity, determined using net operating income and estimated equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (for those in a Segment, return on equity of the Segment)  15%; (c) Company growth performance, determined as a weighted average of the results of certain emphasized lines of business in each Segment, measured with respect to a new sales measure and/or GAAP revenue (for those in a Segment, growth performance of the Segment)  40%; (d) compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act determined by standards relating to the amount of new deficiencies in 2006 and progress in remediating previously identified deficiencies  10%; and (e) general business compliance determined based on the completion of various milestones and measures related to ongoing corporate compliance and fraud deterrence activities (for those in a Segment, based on the achievement of specific goals applicable to the particular compliance priorities of that Segment)  10%. Net operating income will be normalized for the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, changes in accounting policies or principles and other significant events, and, for those in a Segment, for the economic effect of the variance of plan versus actual allocated equity.
     As provided for in the Executive Management Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion to increase or reduce the actual amounts payable, regardless of the achievement of performance criteria previously established.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  May 4, 2006  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the first quarter 2006.
Net income in the first quarter of 2006 increased 42% to $162.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, versus first quarter 2005 net income of $114.4 million, or $0.82 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the first quarter of 2006 increased 42% to $163.8 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2005 net operating income of $115.1 million, or $0.82 per diluted share.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said: "We are pleased with Assurant's strong first quarter performance, the best in our history. Tremendous results in our Solutions and Specialty Property businesses were the primary driver of improved net operating income. Our diversified specialty insurance strategy continues to deliver strong profitability and we are pleased with our progress in generating long-term profitable growth."
Net earned premiums of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2006 increased 2% from the same period in 2005. Excluding the sale of the preneed U.S. independent franchise, net earned premiums would be up 5%, primarily driven by 20% net earned premium growth in Solutions and Specialty Property.
Net investment income in the first quarter of 2006 increased to $192.6 million from $164.2 million in the first quarter of 2005 primarily as a result of improved yields. Excluding $14.7 million of investment income from a real estate partnership in the
 
quarter, the yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents was 5.75% in the first quarter of 2006, compared to 5.54% in the fourth quarter of 2005, and 5.51% in the first quarter of 2005.
Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2006 net operating income was $97.3 million, up 78% from first quarter 2005 net operating income of $54.8 million. Net operating income for the first quarter 2006 increased primarily due to low combined ratios. First quarter 2006 includes $7.8 million pre tax of reimbursements received for processing and adjudicating services under the National Flood Insurance Program. Results were also favorably impacted by a 22% increase in investment income including $2.5 million pre tax of investment income from a real estate partnership and a 20% increase in fee income during the quarter.
Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2006 net earned premiums increased 20% to $739.2 million from $615.2 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is a result of premium growth in all of our Specialty Property
 
businesses, especially in creditor-placed homeowners, as well as growth in Solutions' domestic and international extended service contracts.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health first quarter 2006 net operating income decreased 9% to $45.1 million from $49.7 million in the same period in 2005. The decrease is primarily the result of a decline in small group membership and an increase in expenses aimed at growing the individual markets business. Results benefited from $7.4 million pre tax of investment income from a real estate partnership. The combined ratio for the quarter was 91.6% as a result of stable loss ratios.
Assurant Health first quarter 2006 net earned premiums of $523.4 million decreased 5% from $549.5 million in the same period in 2005, due to the decline in small group premiums. Individual medical premiums increased despite a small decline in membership.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2006 net operating income increased 17% to $19.2 million from net operating income of $16.4 million in the same period of 2005. Net operating income for the first quarter 2006 increased primarily due to improved disability and dental loss experience.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 6% to $326.1 million from $345.9 million in the same period of 2005. The decrease was driven primarily by lower sales and persistency due to changes to support the business' small case strategy. Disability premiums include single premium amounts of $33.9 million in the quarter related to the assumption of closed blocks compared to $26.7 million in the first quarter of 2005.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2006 net operating income decreased 1% to $6.9 million from net operating income of $7.0 million in the same period of 2005. The first quarter includes $1.9 million pre tax of transaction expenses related to the sale of the preneed U.S. independent franchise.
Assurant Preneed first quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 31% to $84.0 million from $121.2 million in the same period of 2005 primarily due to the sale of the preneed U.S. independent franchise. Lower U.S. premium growth was partially offset by continued growth in Canada.
 
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2006 was $0.4 million, compared to a loss of $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2005. The improvement in results is primarily the result of a reduction in expenses associated with the required change in accounting methodology for stock appreciation rights costs. Also, Corporate and other results include $4.8 million pre tax of investment income from a real estate partnership.
Financial Position
At March 31, 2006 total assets were $24.7 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $3.6 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 4% to $27.18 from $26.25 at December 31, 2005. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, dropped to 21.8%.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, July 19, 2006  Assurant, Inc.

Safe Harbor Statement:

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measure
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measure to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of this measure may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measure to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please see Page 3 for reconciliation.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  August 3, 2006  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the second quarter 2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2006.
Second Quarter Results
Net income in the second quarter of 2006 was $151.1 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, versus second quarter 2005 net income of $127.6 million, or $0.92 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the second quarter of 2006 increased 15% to $149.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2005 net operating income of $130.2 million, or $0.94 per diluted share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring, items.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "We are pleased with the continued strong quarterly results of our diverse and specialized insurance business, especially with the growth and profitability we are achieving in our Specialty Property business."
Net earned premiums of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2006 increased 4% from $1.6 billion in the same period in 2005.
Net investment income in the second quarter of 2006 increased to $180.4 million from $177.0 million in the second quarter of 2005 as a result of higher invested assets and a rise in interest rates. The second quarter of 2005 included $9.4 million of investment income from a real estate partnership. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.83% in the second quarter of 2006, compared to 5.63% in the second quarter of 2005.
Six-Month Results
Net income in the first half of 2006 was $313.6 million, an increase of 30%, or $2.39 per diluted share, versus first half 2005 net income of $242 million, or $1.73 per diluted share.
Net operating income for the first half of 2006 increased 28% to $313.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared to first half 2005 net operating income of $245.3 million, or $1.75 per diluted share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring, items.
Net earned premiums of $3.4 billion in the first half of 2006 increased 3% from $3.3 billion in the same period in 2005.
Net investment income in the first half of 2006 increased to $373.0 million from $341.2 million in the first half of 2005 as a result of higher invested assets and a rise in interest rates. Investment income includes $14.7 million of investment income from a real estate partnership in the first half of 2006 and $9.4 million in the first half of 2005. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.74% in the first half of 2006 compared to 5.57% in the first half of 2005.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant, including separate net operating income for Assurant Solutions (which now includes the preneed business) and Assurant Specialty Property.
 
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2006 net operating income was $37.1 million, a decrease of 12% from second quarter 2005 net operating income of $42.4 million. Second quarter 2005 results included $9.4 million pre-tax investment income from a real estate partnership. Net operating income for the first half of 2006 was $76.9 million, an increase of 17%, from $65.8 million during the first half of 2005. Net operating income during the second quarter and first half of 2006 was positively impacted by higher investment income and fee income driven primarily by growth in domestic and international extended service contracts.
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2006 net earned premiums increased 7% to $592.2 million from $554.8 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums during the first half of 2006 increased 7% to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion during the first half of 2005. The increases are attributable primarily to the steady growth in domestic and international extended service contracts partially offset by the anticipated decline in preneed premiums due to the sale of the U.S. independent preneed franchise.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2006 net operating income was $59.3 million, an increase of 73% from second quarter 2005 net operating income of $34.2 million. Net operating income for the first half of 2006 grew 71% to $123.7 million compared to $72.5 million during the first half of 2005. Net operating income increases in the second quarter and first half are primarily the result of premium growth, continued favorable combined ratios and a positive contribution from the acquisition of Safeco Financial Institution Solutions (Safeco FIS). In addition, results were favorably impacted by increased investment income and by reimbursements received for processing claims under the National Flood Insurance Program. These reimbursements totaled $1.9 million pre-tax in the second quarter and $9.7 million pre-tax in the first half of 2006.
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter net earned premiums increased by 40%, to $291.0 million, compared to $207.7 million in the same period a year ago. Net earned premiums during the first half of 2006 increased 33% to $543.7 million compared to $408.8 million during the first half of 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in net earned premiums in the creditor-placed homeowners business including $30 million of net earned premiums representing two months of assumed business from Safeco FIS.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2006 net operating income decreased 17% to $41.0 million from $49.4 million in the same period in 2005. Net operating income for the first
 
half of 2006 decreased 13% to $86.1 million from $99.0 million during the first half of 2005. The decreases in net operating income are primarily due to declines in net earned premiums in small group. Assurant Health has continued to maintain a low combined ratio despite an increase in expenses to grow the individual medical business.
Assurant Health second quarter 2006 net earned premiums of $519.6 million decreased 5% from $544.3 million in the same period in 2005. Net earned premiums for the first half of 2006 decreased 5% to $1.0 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the first half of 2005. Growth in individual medical net earned premiums was offset by declines in small group premiums.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2006 net operating income increased 110% to $20.6 million from net operating income of $9.8 million in the same period of 2005. Net operating income for the first half of 2006 increased 52% to $39.8 million from $26.2 million during the first half of 2005. The increases are primarily due to favorable disability, life and dental loss experience.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 11% to $282.6 million from $316.4 million in the same period of 2005. Net earned premiums for the first half of 2006 decreased 8% to $608.7 million from $662.3 million in the first half of 2005. The decrease was driven primarily by lower sales and persistency due to our small case focus and our continued underwriting discipline.
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2006 was $4.9 million, compared to a loss of $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2005. The second quarter of 2005 included a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to a tax clarification for taxes on repatriated capital under the American Jobs Creation Act. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first half totaled $5.4 million compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the first half of 2005. The improvement in the first half of 2006 results is primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with the change in accounting methodology for stock appreciation rights costs. Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the anticipated run-off of these businesses.
Financial Position
June 30, 2006 total assets were $24.5 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) was $3.6 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 6% to $27.95 from $26.25 at December 31, 2005. AOCI, which mainly consists of unrealized gains and losses on our fixed income securities, declined by $259.5 million after-tax mainly due to the impact of rising interest rates during the six months. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, dropped to 21.6%.

The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.70% in the first nine months of 2006 compared to 5.57% in the first nine months of 2005.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2006 net operating income was $41.7 million, up 31% from third quarter 2005 net operating income of $31.9 million. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2006 was $118.6 million, up 21%, from $97.8 million during the same period of 2005. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, results were positively impacted by increased investment income, higher fee income resulting primarily from continued growth in the domestic and international extended service contract business, and $7.8 million of fee income from a closed block of extended service contracts in the third quarter 2006.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2006 net earned premiums increased 6% to $591.2 million from $556.1 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net earned premiums during the first nine months of 2006 increased 7% to $1.75 billion from $1.65 billion during the first nine months of 2005. The increases are attributable primarily to the steady growth in extended service contracts partially offset by the decline in preneed premiums due to the sale of the U.S. independent preneed franchise in 2005.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2006 net operating income was $53.4 million, up 69% from third quarter 2005 net operating income of $31.7 million. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2006 grew 70% to $177.2 million compared to $104.2 million during the first nine months of 2005. Net operating income increases for the third quarter and the nine-month period are primarily the result of continued favorable combined ratios, the growth of creditor-placed homeowners insurance including the second quarter 2006 acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed insurance business, and no significant catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2006 compared with $31.1 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in the third quarter of 2005. Net operating income during the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 benefited by $6.5 million after-tax and $11.1 million after-tax, respectively, from favorable client settlements.
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter net earned premiums increased by 43%, to $313.6 million, compared to $219.4 million in the same period a year ago. Net earned premiums during the first nine months of 2006 increased 36% to $857.4 million compared to $628.2 million during the first nine months of 2005. These increases are a result of continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance and the acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed insurance business in May 2006.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2006 net operating income decreased 2% to $44.8 million from $45.7 million in the same period in 2005. Continued favorable combined ratios were offset by continued declines in small group membership. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2006 decreased 10% to $131.0 million from $144.8 million during the same period in 2005. Results for the first nine months of 2006 reflect continued favorable combined ratios and a 12% increase in investment income primarily related to investment income from a real estate investment partnership in the first quarter of 2006.
Assurant Health third quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 3% to $521.5 million from $538.8 million during the same period in 2005. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2006 decreased 4% to $1.56 billion compared to $1.63 billion in the first nine months of 2005. Continued growth in individual medical net earned premiums was offset by declines in small group premiums.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2006 net operating income increased 7% to $24.4 million from net operating income of $22.8 million in the same period of 2005. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2006 increased 31% to $64.2 million from $49.0 million during the first nine months of 2005. The increases are primarily due to very favorable loss experience across all product lines.
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $291.2 million from $306.9 million in the same period of 2005. Disability premiums include single premium amounts of $12.4 million in the
third quarter of 2006 related to the assumption of closed blocks. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2006 decreased 7% to $899.9 million from $969.3 million in the first nine months of 2005. Disability premiums include single premium amounts of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2006 related to the assumption of closed blocks compared to $26.7 million in the first nine months of 2005. The decreases for the quarter and the nine months are a result of lower sales and persistency as the business continues to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate
Corporate and Other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2006 was $7.5 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2005. Corporate and Other net operating loss for the first nine months of 2006 totaled $13.0 million, compared to a loss of $18.1 million in the same period last year. The year to date decline in the net operating loss is primarily attributable to a reduction in expenses associated with the change in accounting methodology for stock appreciation rights costs, effective January 1, 2006, and higher investment income.
Financial Position
September 30, 2006 total assets were $25.0 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI,) was $3.6 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 8% to $28.47 from $26.25 at December 31, 2005. AOCI, which mainly consists of unrealized gains and losses on our fixed income securities, decreased by $61.3 million after-tax to $158.2 million from $219.5 million at December 31, 2005. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, decreased to 21.6% from 22.2% at December 31, 2005.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.

Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 10, 2006, Assurant, Inc. issued a press release announcing that it has filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to obtain a five day extension of the due date for its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01 Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, November 10, 2006  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant" or "company") (NYSE: AIZ), today announced that it has filed notification with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 12b-25 pursuant to which the company is seeking an extension of up to five days to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006.
The company's management is assessing whether certain amounts were incorrectly classified in the company's unaudited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended September 30, 2006 and prior periods. The potential misclassifications are primarily attributable to the net increase (decrease) in payables and receivables arising from investment purchases and sales that had not yet settled as of the end of the reporting period.
This could affect the subtotals of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, but will have no impact on the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations or the related earnings per share amounts as of the end of or for any previously reported period. As a result of this review, the company is also assessing the effectiveness of its controls over financial reporting as they relate to the preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows.
The quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which was due to be filed on November 9, 2006 is expected to be filed prior to or on November 14, 2006; however, there can be no assurance that the 10-Q will be filed on or prior to such date.
Assurant, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AIZ, has more than $20 billion in assets and $7 billion in annual revenue. The Assurant Web site is .

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
Management of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") has concluded that certain amounts were incorrectly classified in the Company's unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 and June 30, 2006 and 2005, included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006 (the "2006 Forms 10-Q"). In connection with the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September 30, 2006, management of the Company concluded on November 9, 2006 that the Company should file Forms 10-Q/A restating the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in the 2006 Forms 10-Q. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006 should not be relied upon. Correct classifications were included in the Company's unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The Company has implemented enhancements to its internal control over financial reporting, primarily with respect to the periodic analysis and review of the statement of cash flows, designed to provide reasonable assurance that errors of this type in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will not recur.
Although the restatements will affect the subtotals of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, they will have no impact on the net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for any previously reported period. The restatements will also have no impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations or the related earnings per share amounts as of the end of or for any previously reported period.
The restatements are primarily attributable to the incorrect classification in prior periods of the net increase (decrease) in payables and receivables arising from investment purchases and sales that had not yet settled as of the end of the reporting period. In the affected previously reported Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, changes in the net receivable/payable from unsettled investment purchases and sales were classified within "adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities." To the extent such balances pertained to investments classified as available for sale, changes in such balances should have been included within cash flows from investing activities, consistent with the related investments.
The above conclusions were reached in consultation with members of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company has informed our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, of these matters.
 
The following Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 as well as for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 set forth the effects of these restatements:
 
 
 
On November 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") authorized the Company to extend the term (through December 31, 2008) of its existing Change in Control Severance Agreements with several officers, including the named executive officers, effective as of January 1, 2007.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  February 7, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "For the fourth quarter and the year, our specialty business strategy continues to deliver strong profits, good premium growth and an industry top quartile operating R.O.E. of 16.7%. Overall, these results demonstrate three years of steady execution rewarding shareholders with growing profitability and improved ROE's. In 2007, we continue to leverage our core capabilities to create opportunities and overcome challenges ahead. We are committed to becoming a recognized leader in managing a diverse specialty insurance business. This will serve us well in the new global economic landscape."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $252.5 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, versus fourth quarter 2005 net income of $137.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share. Net income in the fourth quarter 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of the company's interest in a PPO network, Private Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) which is included in net realized gains on investments. Net income in the fourth quarter 2006 also includes $40.5 million of after-tax income from an Assurant Solutions favorable legal settlement. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes $39.4 million of tax benefits and adjustments resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 4% to $136.2 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2005 net operating income of $142.4 million, or $1.07 per diluted share. Each business reported quarter over quarter earnings growth. However, the corporate and other segment reported a decrease primarily attributable to the $39.4 million of tax benefits reported in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Net earned premiums of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 8% from $1.6 billion in the same period in 2005.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 7% to $183.0 million from $170.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in yields and average invested assets. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.73% in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 5.54% in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Twelve-Month Results
Net income in 2006 was $717.4 million, or $5.57 per diluted share, a 50% increase over 2005 net income of $479.4 million, or $3.50 per diluted share. Net income in 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of PHCS as well as $40.5 million of after-tax income from an Assurant Solutions favorable legal settlement. The full year 2005 includes $44.9 million of tax benefits and adjustment resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits.
Net operating income in 2006 increased 17% to $602.7 million, or $4.68 per diluted share, compared to $513.3 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, in 2005. The full year 2005 includes $44.9 million of tax benefits and adjustments resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits.
Net earned premiums in 2006 were $6.8 billion, a 5% increase compared to $6.5 billion in 2005.
Net investment income in 2006 increased 7% to $736.7 million from $687.3 million in 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in yields and average invested assets. Net investment income includes $18.6 million of investment income from real estate partnerships in 2006 compared to $12.6 million in 2005. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.67% in 2006 compared to 5.54% in 2005.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2006 net operating income was $39.8 million, up 13% from fourth quarter 2005 net operating income of $35.4 million. Net operating income for 2006 was $158.4 million, up 19% from $133.2 million in 2005. The increases for the quarter and the year are primarily due to growth in extended service contracts and higher investment income generated by an increase in investment yield and average invested assets. The quarterly results would have been more positive if not for unfavorable loss experience specific to two domestic extended service contract clients.
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2006 net earned premiums increased 8% to $617.8 million from $573.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net earned premiums during 2006 increased 7% to $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion in 2005. The increases are primarily due to the steady growth in domestic and international extended service contracts offset by a decline in preneed premiums due to the 2005 sale of the company's U.S. independent preneed franchise and the run-off of the domestic credit business.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2006 net operating income was $64.0 million, up 64% from fourth quarter 2005 net operating income of $39.0 million. Favorable settlements with two former clients contributed $5.5 million after-tax to the fourth quarter. Net operating income for 2006 grew 68% to $241.1 million compared to $143.2 million during 2005. Net operating income increases for the fourth quarter and the year are primarily the result of growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, which includes the acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed insurance business, coupled with a benign hurricane season. There were no catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $17.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were $6.8 million in 2006 compared to $48.7 million in 2005.
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2006 net earned premiums increased 52%, to $350.9 million, compared to $230.7 million in the same period a year ago. Net earned premiums during 2006 increased 41% to $1.2 billion compared to $858.8 million during 2005. These increases are a result of continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, including the acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed insurance business.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2006 net operating income increased 11% to $37.0 million from $33.3 million in the same period in 2005. The increase is attributable to continued favorable combined ratios driven by lower expenses. For the full year of 2006, net operating income decreased 6% to $167.9 million from $178.1 million in 2005. Results for 2006 reflect continued declines in small group revenue and a slight increase in the combined ratio.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $519.4 million from $531.3 million during the same period in 2005. Net earned premiums for the full year 2006 decreased 4% to $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion for 2005. Continued growth in individual medical net earned premiums was offset by declines in small group premiums for both the quarter and year.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2006 net operating income increased slightly to $19.4 million from net operating income of $19.3 million in the same period of 2005. Net operating income for the full year 2006 increased 22% to $83.6 million from $68.4 million during 2005. Results were driven by very favorable loss experience most notably in group disability.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2006 net earned premiums decreased 9% to $280.0 million from $308.6 million in the same period of 2005. Net earned premiums for the full year 2006 decreased 8% to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in 2005. The decreases for the quarter and the full year are primarily a result of lower sales and persistency as the business continues to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance was $5.9 million after tax compared to $4.7 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2005. Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $19.9 million, compared to income of $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter 2006 results include $3.3 million after-tax of expenses to fund the Assurant Foundation and $6.2 million associated with an increase in certain tax liabilities. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes $39.4 million of tax benefits and adjustments resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits. Corporate and other net operating loss for 2006 totaled $32.8 million, compared to income of $2.7 million in the same period last year. For the full year 2005, tax benefits and adjustments resulting from the resolution of several years' tax audits were $44.9 million.
Financial Position
December 31, 2006 total assets were $25.2 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) was $3.7 billion and book value per diluted share, was up 14% to $29.97 from $26.25 at December 31, 2005. AOCI, which consists mainly of pension under-funding related to the required adoption of FAS 158 and unrealized gains and losses on our fixed income securities, decreased to $88.1 million from $219.5 million at December 31, 2005. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, decreased to 21.0% at December 31, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  May 2, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the first quarter 2007.
Net income in the first quarter of 2007 increased 10% to $179.5 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, versus first quarter 2006 net income of $162.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the first quarter of 2007 increased 7% to $175.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2006 net operating income of $163.8 million, or $1.24 per diluted share.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said: "We are off to a good start this year. Our annualized operating return on equity for the first quarter 2007 was 18.6% and we continue to make excellent progress in our targeted growth areas. Our results this quarter demonstrate our commitment to continued disciplined growth as well as the strength of our diversified specialty insurance business."
Net earned premiums of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2007 increased 5% from the same period in 2006, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in the first quarter of 2007 increased 13% to $216.9 million from $192.6 million in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an $18.8 million pre-tax increase in real estate investment income.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2007 net operating income was $44.1 million, up 11% from first quarter 2006 net operating income of $39.8 million. The increase for the quarter was primarily attributable to higher investment income due to $7.8 million of additional after-tax real estate investment income compared to first quarter 2006. Results were impacted by higher international combined ratios due to investments made to support the business' strategic expansion. In addition, domestic combined ratios continued to be affected by unfavorable loss experience associated with to two domestic service contract clients.
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 2% to $583.0 million from $570.4 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to growth in domestic and international service contracts and growth in international credit insurance. Results were offset by an expected decline in preneed premiums due to the 2005 sale of the U.S. independent preneed franchise and the continued runoff of domestic credit insurance.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2007 net operating income was $74.4 million, up 16% from $64.4 million in the first quarter 2006 which included $5.2 million after-tax of reimbursements received for processing claims under the National Flood Insurance Program. The increase for the quarter was primarily driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners, including the second quarter 2006 acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed homeowners insurance business, and excellent combined ratios.
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 45% to $367.0 million compared to $252.7 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is attributable to the continued organic growth and the above mentioned acquisition.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health first quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 10% to $40.5 million from $45.1 million in the same year-ago period. While Assurant Health continues to have a favorable combined ratio, the decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of the continuing decline in small group net earned premiums and lower real estate investment income of $2.5 million after-tax compared to the first quarter of 2006.
Assurant Health first quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $512.8 million from $523.4 million in the same year-ago period. Continued growth in individual medical premiums during the quarter of 6% was offset by a 12% decline in small group and short term medical premiums.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2007 net operating income increased 51% to $29.0 million from net operating income of $19.2 million in the same year-ago period. Results during the quarter were favorably impacted by $9.2 million of additional after-tax real estate investment income. Results also reflect continued favorable loss experience, most notably in the disability and life products.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 9% to $296.7 million from $326.1 million in the same year-ago period as the business continues to implement its small case strategy.
 
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2007 was $7.6 million, compared to a loss of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. The higher loss was primarily due to an increase of tax expense of $5.8 million resulting from changes in certain tax liabilities and reduced real estate investment income of $2.4 million after-tax.
Financial Position
At March 31, 2007 total assets were $25.5 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $3.8 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 4% to $31.14 from $29.97 at December 31, 2006.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release.

Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

New York  July 17, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), announced today that the company has learned that Robert B.

Under the SEC's procedures, recipients of a Wells notice have the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff before the staff makes its formal recommendation to the Commission on whether any civil enforcement action should be brought by the SEC.
As previously disclosed on July 5, 2007, two employees of Assurant Solutions / Assurant Specialty Property, Michael Steinman and Dan Folse, also received Wells notices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  July 18, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has appointed J.

Assurant continues to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation. As previously announced, the Board has formed a Special Committee of non-management directors to continue evaluating the matter and to recommend appropriate actions to the Board with respect to the investigation. As previously disclosed, the Company believes the SEC's investigation involves a catastrophe reinsurance contract the Company had with one reinsurer that commenced over a decade ago, expired in 2004, and was not renewed.
"Kerry Clayton is a talented and highly regarded executive with an impressive leadership track record at Assurant and deep knowledge of the Company," said Board chairman Dr. John Palms. "As former president and CEO of Assurant, Kerry played a pivotal role in bringing Assurant public and developing much of the foundation that has enabled the Company's successful growth. The Board is highly confident in Kerry's ability to continue to execute on Assurant's proven business strategy.
"We are also pleased to appoint Mike Peninger to lead Assurant's financial operations," continued Dr. Palms. "He brings both firsthand leadership experience at Assurant, deep knowledge of our corporate culture and a strong background in finance to his new role. Mike has broad experience within Assurant, including being CEO and previously CFO of Assurant Employee Benefits and currently a member of Assurant's Management Committee. We look forward to his continued contributions."
"Assurant has a unique business model that has a strong track record of growth and delivering shareholder value," said Mr. Clayton. "Together with the management team and all Assurant employees, I will continue to focus on our successful business strategy. As always, our priority is to address our customer and partner needs and build on our diversified specialty insurance platform."
Mr. Clayton, 61, served as chief executive officer of Assurant from 2000 through his retirement in 2006. He also served as president of the Company through June 2005, and vice chairman of Assurant's Board of Directors through the end of 2006. From 1993 to 1999, Mr. Clayton was executive vice president of Assurant with a variety of responsibilities and, from 1985 to 1993, he served as president of what is now Assurant Employee Benefits. Mr. Clayton also was senior vice president, finance of Assurant from 1981 to 1985. He began his career in 1970 with American Security Group, which was acquired by Assurant in 1980. Mr. Clayton holds an engineering degree from Georgia Tech and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  August 2, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the second quarter of 2007 and the six months ended June 30, 2007.
Second Quarter Results
Net income in the second quarter of 2007 increased 10% to $166.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, versus second quarter 2006 net income of $151.1 million, or $1.16 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the second quarter of 2007 increased 12% to $168.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2006 net operating income of $149.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted share.
J. Kerry Clayton, interim president and chief executive officer, said: "Assurant's results this quarter highlight the benefits of our diversified specialty insurance business platform. We continue to focus on long-term profitable growth for the benefit of our customers, clients, shareholders and employees by applying our core capabilities and investing in those areas of our business that offer the best long-term potential. We have a strong financial foundation and proven business model that has positioned us well for the future."
Net earned premiums of $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2007 increased 7% from the same period in 2006, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in the second quarter of 2007 increased 5% to $190.3 million from $180.4 million in the second quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets.
Six-Month Results
Net income in the first half of 2007 was $345.7 million, an increase of 10%, or $2.80 per diluted share, versus first half 2006 net income of $313.6 million, or $2.39 per diluted share.
Net operating income for the first half of 2007 was $344.1 million, an increase of 10%, or $2.79 per diluted share, versus first half 2006 net operating income of $313.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring items.
Net earned premiums of $3.6 billion in the first half of 2007 increased 6% from $3.4 billion in the first half of 2006.
Net investment income in the first half of 2007 increased 9% to $407.2 million from $373.0 million in the first half of 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in average invested assets and $36.5 million of real estate investment income compared with $14.7 million in the first half of 2006.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2007 net operating income was $30.2 million, a decrease of 19% from second quarter 2006 net operating income of $37.1 million. The second quarter of 2007 benefited from $3.6 million after-tax relating to three items: $3.5 million in fees from the sale of the U.S. preneed independent franchise, $4.5 million of income resulting from a project to improve the reconciliation of client commission payable accounts, and a $4.4 million charge related to a product in Brazil that has since been repriced for some clients and discontinued for another client. Net operating income for the first six months of 2007 was $74.3 million, a decrease of 3% from $76.9 million during the first half of 2006. The decreases for second quarter and the first half of 2007 are primarily due to higher combined ratios, principally resulting from continued investments made to support the business' international strategic expansion and continued unfavorable loss experience associated with two previously disclosed domestic service contract clients. Results for the first six months of 2007 were positively impacted by an additional $8.4 million of after-tax real estate investment income compared to the first half of 2006.
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 4% to $618.7 million from $592.2 million in the same period last year. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2007 increased 3% to $1.20 billion from $1.16 billion during the first half of 2006. The increases are primarily due to growth in domestic and international
 
service contracts partially offset by an expected decline in preneed premiums due to the 2005 sale of the U.S. independent preneed franchise and the continued runoff of domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2007 net operating income was $90.2 million, up 52% from $59.3 million in the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter 2007 was positively impacted by $5.5 million after-tax from a project to improve the reconciliation of client commission payable accounts. Net operating income in the first six months of 2007 increased 33% to $164.6 million compared to $123.7 million in the first half of 2006. Increases for the second quarter and first half of 2007 are primarily due to the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, including the second quarter 2006 acquisition of Safeco's creditor-placed homeowners business, continued favorable combined ratios and increased investment income, partially offset by higher reinsurance costs.
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 35% to $393.6 million compared to $291.0 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2007 increased 40% to $760.7 million compared to $543.7 million in the first half of 2006. The increases for the quarter and first half of 2007 are primarily attributable to the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, partially offset by higher reinsurance costs.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 18% to $33.8 million from $41.0 million in the same period in 2006. Net operating income for the first six months of 2007 decreased 14% to $74.4 million from $86.1 million in the first half of 2006. The decreases for the quarter and first half of 2007 are primarily due to the decline in small group net earned premiums along with an increase in the combined ratio as a result of higher small group loss experience.
Assurant Health second quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 1% to $513.9 million from $519.6 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2007 decreased 2% to $1.03 billion from $1.04 billion in the first six months of 2006. Continued growth in individual medical premiums during the first six months was offset by a decline in small group premiums.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2007 net operating income increased 4% to $21.5 million from net operating income of $20.6 million in the same period in 2006. Net
 
operating income during the first six months of 2007 increased 27% to $50.4 million from $39.8 million during the first six months of 2006. Results for the second quarter and first half of 2007 reflect continued favorable loss experience, most notably in the disability and life insurance products. Results were favorably impacted by $9.9 million of after-tax real estate investment income in the first six months of 2007.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 4% to $272.5 million from $282.6 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2007 decreased 6% to $569.1 million from $608.7 million in the first six months of 2006 as the business continues to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2007 was $2.9 million, compared to a loss of $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. The improvement in the operating loss was primarily due to $2.9 million of income from the change in certain tax liabilities. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first half of 2007 was $10.5 million compared to a net operating loss of $5.4 million during the first half of 2006. The increase in the net operating loss was mainly due to $2.9 million of expenses from the change in certain tax liabilities and $2.4 million less of after-tax real estate investment income compared to the first half of 2006.
Financial Position
At June 30, 2007 total assets were $25.8 billion.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  November 1, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the third quarter of 2007 and the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
Third Quarter Results
Net income in the third quarter of 2007 increased 24% to $187.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 net income of $151.3 million, or $1.18 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the third quarter of 2007 increased 28% to $195.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 net operating income of $153.0 million, or $1.20 per diluted share.
J. Kerry Clayton, interim president and chief executive officer, said: "Assurant's performance so far this year and during the quarter illustrates the strength of our diversified specialty insurance strategy, and our prudent, focused approach to long-term profitable growth in targeted areas. Our strategy is fortified by our solid financial foundation and is reinforced by our strong leadership team which continues a disciplined approach."
Net earned premiums of $1.89 billion in the third quarter of 2007 increased 10% from $1.72 billion in the third quarter of 2006, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in the third quarter of 2007 increased 7% to $194.0 million from $180.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets and higher investment yield.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first nine months of 2007 was $532.9 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, an increase of 15%, compared to net income of $464.9 million, or $3.58 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 was $539.8 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, an increase of 16% compared to net operating income of $466.5 million, or $3.59 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring items.
Net earned premiums of $5.45 billion in the first nine months of 2007 increased 7% from $5.08 billion in the first nine months of 2006.
Net investment income in the first nine months of 2007 increased 9% to $601.2 million from $553.7 million in the first nine months of 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in average invested assets and $37.0 million of real estate investment income compared with $18.0 million in the first nine months of 2006.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2007 net operating income was $37.4 million, a 10% decrease from the third quarter 2006 net operating income of $41.7 million. The third quarter of 2006 benefited from $5.4 million after-tax of fee income from a closed block of extended service contract business. In the third quarter of 2007, the preneed insurance product benefited from the July 2007 acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company ("Mayflower"). Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 was $111.7 million, a 6% decrease from $118.6 million during the first nine months of 2006. Results for the first nine months of 2007 were positively impacted by increased investment income including an additional $7.6 million of after tax real estate investment income compared to the first nine months of 2006. The quarter and first nine months of 2007 declined primarily as a result of higher domestic and international combined ratios due to less favorable domestic service contract loss experience, the previously disclosed loss of a debt deferment client in late 2006 and continued investments made to support the business' international strategic expansion.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 10% to $649.9 million from $591.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 increased 6% to $1.85 billion from $1.75 billion during the first nine months of 2006. The increases for the quarter and nine months were primarily due to continued strong growth in domestic and international service contracts and $9.9 million of preneed premiums from the Mayflower acquisition. The increases were partially offset by declines in preneed premiums due to the 2005 sale of the U.S. independent franchise and in domestic credit insurance which continues to diminish consistent with long-term expectations.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2007 net operating income was $114.7 million, up significantly from $53.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net operating income in the first nine months of 2007 increased 58% to $279.3 million compared to $177.2 million in the first nine months of 2006. Net operating income increases for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007 were primarily driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance both organically and through acquisition, continued exceptional combined ratios, including no catastrophic experience during the quarter or year-to-date, and increased investment income.
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 42% to $445.2 million compared to $313.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 increased 41% to $1.21 billion compared to $857.4 million in the first nine months of 2006. These increases are primarily due to the continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. The nine month results benefited from the creditor-placed business acquired from Safeco in May of 2006.
 
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 12% to $39.4 million from $44.8 million in the third quarter of 2006. The third quarter of 2006 benefited from $2.6 million after-tax in favorable legal settlements. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 13% to $113.7 million from $131.0 million in the first nine months of 2006. The decreases for the quarter and first nine months of 2007 are primarily due to the decline in small group net earned premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to higher small group loss experience. This was partially offset by continued individual medical net earned premium growth. After-tax real estate investment income was $2.5 million less in the first nine months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006.
Assurant Health third quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 1% to $514.2 million from $521.5 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 2% to $1.54 billion from $1.56 billion in the first nine months of 2006. Although individual medical premiums for the quarter and first nine months grew, individual medical sales for the quarter declined due to increased competitive pressures. Small group premiums continued to decline as expected.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 16% to $20.4 million from net operating income of $24.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. Although group life loss experience was good for the quarter, it was not as good as the excellent group life loss experience in the same period last year. Group disability and group dental loss experience continued to be favorable. Net operating income during the first nine months of 2007 increased 10% to $70.8 million from $64.2 million during the first nine months of 2006. Results for the first nine months of 2007 benefited from continued favorable overall loss experience, particularly in group disability, and were positively impacted by an additional $9.3 million of after-tax real estate investment income compared to the first nine months of 2006.
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $284.0 million from $291.2 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 5% to $853.2 million from $899.9 million in the first nine months of 2006. These decreases are due to lower persistency as the company continues to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2007 was $11.7 million, compared to a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2006. The decrease is mainly due to $3.2 million after-tax of expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss
 
mitigation products. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first nine months of 2007 was $22.1 million compared to a loss of $13.0 million during the first nine months of 2006. This decline was primarily due to $3.2 million after tax of expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products and $3.5 million of expenses due to the change in certain tax liabilities.
Financial Position
At September 30, 2007 total assets were $26.6 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $3.9 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 10% to $32.99 from $29.97 at December 31, 2006. Nine month annualized operating return on equity (ROE), excluding AOCI, (see footnote 2), was 18.8%, and rolling four quarter operating ROE, excluding AOCI, (see footnote 2), was 18.0%. The debt to total capital ratio, excluding AOCI, was 20.2%.

Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation; but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the stockholders present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present or represented.

Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed or determined shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date so fixed or determined.
Section 9. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

The list shall also be produced at the time and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 10. The corporation, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the corporation or candidates for office.

Inspectors appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them by statute. Inspectors shall, subject to the power of the Chairman of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.

The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
(33) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this By-Law to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least eighty days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this By-Law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of these By-Laws.

(B) Special Meetings of Stockholders.
(C) Subject to Article II hereof, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not app ear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law.

Directors shall (except as hereinafter provided for the filling of vacancies and newly created directorships) be elected by the holders of a plurality of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as otherwise provided by law or by the corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.

Unless otherwise required by law and except as provided in the next succeeding sentence or Section 4 of this Article II, newly created directorships in the Board of Directors that result from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and the directors so chosen shall hold office for a term as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
Subject to the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board of Directors and unless otherwise required by law, if there shall exist or occur any vacancy on the Board of Directors with respect to a Fortis Designee (as defined below) and after taking into account such vacancy Fortis Group is still entitled to an additional Fortis Designee pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement (as defined below), the resulting vacancy on the Board of Directors shall be filled at any time by a person who shall be designated by Fortis Insurance (as defined below). The preceding sentence shall terminate immediately and automatically on the first date on which Fortis Group ceases to own at least 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the corporation ("Common Stock") and shall not be reinstated.

Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by series or class, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Certificate of Designation or Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as the case may be, applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to Article SEVENTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless expressly provided by such terms. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock, if any, shall be in addition to the number fixed by or pursuant to the By-Laws. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such seri es or class, the number of directors that may be so elected by the holders of any such series or class of stock shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and without regard to the classification of the members of the Board of Directors as set forth in Section 1 of this Article II, and vacancies among directors so elected by the separate vote of the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by such series or class, or, if there are no such remaining directors, by the holders of such series or class in the same manner in which such series or class initially elected a director.
Section 5. If at any meeting for the election of directors, the corporation has outstanding more than one class of stock, and one or more such classes or series thereof are entitled to vote separately as a class, and there shall be a quorum of only one such class or series of stock, that class or series of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding absence of a quorum of the other class or series of stock.
Section 6. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation.
Section 7. Unless otherwise restricted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law.
Section 8. The members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person at such a meeting.
Section 9. The Board of Directors may establish policies for the compensation of directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the corporation.
Section 10. Any director designated by Fortis Insurance N.V., a company with limited liability incorporated as under Dutch law ("Fortis Insurance"), to serve on the Board of Directors (a "Fortis Designee") as provided for in Article 2 of the Shareholders' Agreement, as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time (the "Shareholders' Agreement"), between the corporation and Fortis Insurance, will resign or retire from the Board of Directors at the written request of Fortis Insurance.

Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that its Board of Directors has unanimously voted to reinstate Robert B. Pollock as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 28, 2008, and that J. Kerry Clayton, who has held those positions on an interim basis, will transition with Mr. Pollock and will remain in an emeritus status through the end of February.
The text of the Company's press release announcing this event, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

New York - January 28, 2008 - Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), announced today that its Board of Directors has unanimously voted to reinstate Robert B. Pollock as president and chief executive officer, effective January 28, 2008, and that J. Kerry Clayton, who has held those positions on an interim basis, will transition with Mr. Pollock and will remain in an emeritus status through the end of February. Because the Board concluded it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, it is taking this action now rather than await the conclusion of the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") investigation.
On July 17, 2007, Assurant announced that Mr. Pollock had been placed on administrative leave by the Company's Board of Directors after he received a "Wells notice" from the Staff of the SEC (the "Staff") in connection with an ongoing industry investigation of certain finite reinsurance contracts. The Board's actions were based on the recommendation of its Special Committee, which thereafter conducted a thorough investigation of the events that had resulted in Mr. Pollock's receipt of the Wells notice.
As previously disclosed, the Company believes the SEC Staff's investigation involves a catastrophe reinsurance contract between the Company and one reinsurer that commenced over a decade ago and expired in 2004. According to Dr. John Palms, Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, the Special Committee was formed to investigate matters believed to be under SEC review. Assurant has completed a comprehensive review, and based on that review, and the work of the Special Committee, the Board has concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for Mr. Pollock to resume his leadership of the Company. Shareholder, customer and employee concerns over long term leadership require Mr. Pollock's return despite the uncertain status of the SEC investigation.
"Rob Pollock is an accomplished executive who has had a long and successful career with Assurant. He has acted consistently in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders and other constituents. We look forward to his renewed leadership as Assurant moves forward," said Dr. Palms. He added that "Assurant, its Board and shareholders are most grateful to Kerry Clayton for serving as interim President and CEO during Rob's absence."
The Board's decision to reinstate Mr. Pollock implies no conclusion concerning the outcome of the SEC Staff's ongoing investigation, and the SEC Staff's Wells notice to him remains in effect. The Company's decision reflects solely the Board's judgment, based on the Special Committee's comprehensive review, that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that he return to his positions at this time, because of concerns over long term leadership by employees, shareholders and customers. The SEC Staff's inquiry continues, and the Company is cooperating fully. The Company cannot predict the duration or outcome of the investigation.
In the course of its response to SEC Staff inquiries, the Company identified certain problems related to its document production process. The Company continues to work diligently to ensure that all relevant documents in the Company's possession have been provided to the SEC Staff. These production issues have delayed resolution of this matter.
In July 2007, two other individuals-P. Bruce Camacho, Assurant's executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Adam Lamnin, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Assurant Solutions/Assurant Special Property-also received Wells notices from the SEC Staff, and were also placed on administrative leave. These two individuals remain on administrative leave pending the completion of the review of the documents related to the SEC's inquiry.
Assurant is a premier provider of specialized insurance products and related services in North America and selected international markets. Its four key businesses-Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant Health, Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property-have partnered with clients who are leaders in their industries and have built leadership positions in a number of specialty insurance market segments worldwide.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  February 7, 2008  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2007.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "Assurant's performance for the quarter and year illustrates our steady execution of our diversified specialty insurance strategy despite the beginning of a slowdown in the economy. We continue to deliver growth in both net operating income and book value per share while producing top quartile return on equity. We believe this strategy has us well positioned for 2008 despite uncertainties in the economy."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 13% to $154.4 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 net operating income of $136.2 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased 52% to $120.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 net income of $252.5 million, or $2.01 per diluted share. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes $27.0 million of after-tax realized losses from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of Assurant's interest in a PPO network, Private Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) and $40.5 million of after-tax income from a favorable Assurant Solutions legal settlement.
Net earned premiums of $1.96 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 11% from $1.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, driven mostly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 8% to $197.8 million from $183.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income in 2007 was $694.2 million, or $5.72 per diluted share, an increase of 15% compared to net operating income of $602.7 million, or $4.68 per diluted share, in 2006. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual or non-recurring items.
Net income in 2007 was $653.7 million, or $5.38 per diluted share, a decrease of 9%, compared to net income of $717.4 million, or $5.57 per diluted share, in 2006. Net income in 2007 includes $31.3 million of after-tax realized losses from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio. Net income in 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of PHCS as well as $40.5 million of after-tax income from a favorable Assurant Solutions legal settlement.
Net earned premiums in 2007 were $7.41 billion, an increase of 8% from $6.84 billion in 2006. Growth in net earned premiums was driven mainly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in 2007 increased 8% to $799.1 million from $736.7 million in 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in average invested assets and $37.2 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared with $18.6 million in 2006.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2007 net operating income was $32.3 million, a 19% decrease from fourth quarter 2006 net operating income of $39.8 million. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by $3.4 million after-tax from a client-related settlement and benefited by $3.8 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project, which has been completed. Net operating income for the full year was $143.9 million, a 9% decrease from 2006 net operating income of $158.4 million. Results for the quarter and year declined primarily due to higher domestic and international combined ratios. Domestic results were impacted by less favorable service contract loss experience and the previously disclosed loss of a debt deferment client in late 2006. The international business was impacted by its continued investment made to support its strategic expansion and modest increases in overall expenses.
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 10% to $678.8 million from $617.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums in 2007 increased 7% to $2.53 billion from $2.37 billion in 2006. Increases for the quarter and year were primarily driven by continued growth in domestic and international service
 
contracts as well as growth in preneed premiums from the acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company during the third quarter of 2007. The increases were partially offset by declines in domestic credit insurance for the fourth quarter and full year 2007, which continues to diminish consistent with our long term expectations.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2007 net operating income was $99.9 million, up 56% from $64.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and tax, during the quarter were $22.2 million compared with no catastrophes losses in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results for the quarter benefited by $5.9 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project, which has been completed. Net operating income in 2007 increased 57% to $379.2 million compared to $241.1 million in 2006. Net operating income increases were largely driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, continued favorable combined ratios and an increase in investment income. For the year, catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and tax, were $22.2 million, compared with $4.5 million in 2006.
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 36% to $476.4 million compared to $350.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums in 2007 increased 39% to $1.68 billion compared to $1.21 billion in 2006. These increases are primarily due to the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. The results for the year also benefited from the creditor-placed business acquired from Safeco in May of 2006.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2007 net operating income increased 3% to $38.0 million from $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily due to a favorable combined ratio and $2.5 million after-tax from a favorable legal settlement. Net operating income for 2007 decreased 10% to $151.7 million from $167.9 million in 2006. The decrease for the year is primarily due to the decline in small group net earned premiums, a slight increase in the combined ratio due to higher small group loss experience and a decrease in investment income. This was partially offset by continued favorable individual medical loss experience and individual medical net earned premium growth. After-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships was $2.5 million lower in 2007 compared to 2006.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $509.3 million from $519.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 17% to $16.2 million from net operating income of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results declined primarily due to a slight increase in loss experience due to a $2.1 million after-tax adjustment to reflect New York State's clarification of certain disability contract provisions and a decline in investment income. Net operating income in 2007 increased 4% to $87.0 million from $83.6 million during 2007. Full year results benefited from continued favorable overall loss experience, particularly in group disability, and were positively impacted by an additional $9.2 million of after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared to 2006.
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 4% to $291.6 million from $280.0 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is mainly the result of $14.3 million of single premium from a closed block of business. Net earned premiums for 2007 decreased 3% to $1.14 billion from $1.18 billion in 2006 as the company continued to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate & Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $27.4 million, compared to a loss of $19.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Higher losses are mainly due to $4.3 million of after-tax expense during the quarter related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. The fourth quarter 2007 results include $6.4 million of net tax expense associated with changes in certain tax liabilities compared with $6.2 million of similar net tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. Corporate and other net operating loss for 2007 was $49.4 million compared to a loss of $32.8 million during 2006. The higher loss for the year was primarily due to $7.5 million of after-tax expense related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products and $9.9 million of net tax expense associated with changes in certain tax liabilities compared with $6.2 million of similar net tax expense in 2006.

Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  May 1, 2008  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the first quarter of 2008.
Net income in the first quarter of 2008 increased 4% to $186.8 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, versus first quarter 2007 net income of $179.5 million, or $1.45 per diluted share. Net income in the first quarter of 2008 includes $28.2 million of after-tax realized losses from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the first quarter of 2008 increased 22% to $214.9 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2007 net operating income of $175.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said: "We are off to a good start for 2008, despite a slowing economy. Our record operating results are grounded in the enduring quality of our diversified, specialty insurance strategy. We are pleased with the progress we're making in areas we have targeted for growth and remain committed to managing our business for the long-term."
Net earned premiums of $1.94 billion in the first quarter of 2008 increased 10% from the same period in 2007, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the first quarter of 2008 decreased 9% to $197.8 million from $216.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 primarily attributable to $33.5 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships recognized during the first quarter of 2007. First quarter 2008 benefited from an increase in average invested assets.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2008 net operating income was $47.6 million, up 8% from the first quarter 2007 net operating income of $44.1 million. The increase was primarily due to $11.7 million of after-tax income from the accrual of contractual receivables established from certain domestic service contract clients. There was no investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $9.4 million after-tax during the first quarter of 2007. Results in the quarter were impacted by continued international investments made to support the business' strategic expansion and by continued less favorable loss experience in the domestic service contract business.
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 17% to $683.5 million from $583.0 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to growth in preneed premiums resulting from the July 2007 acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company, growth in domestic and international service contracts and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, Assurant Solutions net earned premiums in the first quarter increased 15% compared with the first quarter 2007. Results for the quarter were partially offset by the continued decline in domestic credit insurance premiums.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2008 net operating income was $124.7 million, up 68% from $74.4 million in the first quarter 2007. The increase was primarily driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, continued favorable combined ratios and an increase in investment income due to an increase in invested assets. Results for the quarter were also positively impacted by $4.6 million after-tax from a client related settlement. There were no reportable catastrophe losses during the quarter.
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 31% to $481.4 million compared to $367.0 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is mainly attributable to the continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health first quarter 2008 net operating income was $37.3 million, down 8% from first quarter 2007 net operating income of $40.5 million. There was no investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $2.3 million after-tax during the first quarter of 2007. Net operating income was impacted by the continuing decline in small group net earned premiums. Assurant Health continues to maintain a favorable combined ratio.
Assurant Health first quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 3% to $496.1 million from $512.8 million in the same year-ago period. Continued growth in individual premiums during the quarter was offset by a decline in small group medical premiums.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2008 net operating income was $16.3 million, down 44% from first quarter 2007 net operating income of $29.0 million. There was no investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $9.2 million after-tax during the first quarter of 2007. While results for the first quarter of 2008 reflect continued favorable loss experience, the expense ratio increased due to increased sales expenses as a result of the business' continued investment in its small case strategy.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $280.4 million from $296.7 million in the same year-ago period. Results for the quarter include $5.5 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business compared to $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding single premiums from closed blocks of business, net earned premium increased slightly.
 
Corporate & Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2008 was $5.9 million, compared to a loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. The losses for the quarter included a $1.6 million of after-tax expense related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. The improvement in the net operating loss was mainly due to tax expenses of $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from changes in certain tax liabilities.
Financial Position
Our strength is reflected in our financial position. At March 31, 2008 total assets were $26.4 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $4.2 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 5% to $35.33 from $33.73 at December 31, 2007. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 18.9% from 19.7% at December 31, 2007.

Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
        Assurant, Inc. has adopted a new annual bonus plan for Executive Officers called the Assurant, Inc. Executive Short Term Incentive Plan (the "Executive Short Term Incentive Plan"). On May 15, 2008, our shareholders approved the Executive Short Term Incentive Plan. Annual short term incentive payments for Executive Officers for 2008 and later fiscal years will be made under this new plan.
        As described in Proposal Three of our Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2008, the Executive Short Term Incentive Plan permits the payment of annual bonuses to eligible participants based on our net income. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") has designated twelve of our officers as participants in the plan for fiscal year 2008. The potential bonus award to an individual participant for fiscal year 2008 will equal up to 0.38% of our n et income (except for our Chief Executive Officer, whose maximum potential bonus for any fiscal year will equal .77% of our net income), which amount is subject to decrease by the Compensation Committee on the basis of its consideration of a number of factors, including financial and non-financial criteria and corporate and individual performance. Within the framework of the Executive Short Term Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee has established and currently intends to establish in future years criteria, in addition to the basic net income requirement, that it will consider when determining whether, and to what extent, to reduce the actual bonus award below the maximum level determined by the net income requirement. As described in Proposal 3 of the Proxy Statement, the Executive Short Term Incentive Plan is designed to enable us to pay bonuses under the plan that, as qualified performance-based compensation, is not subject to the limits on deductibility imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal R evenue Code of 1986, as amended.
        We have also adopted a new equity incentive plan called the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "Long Term Equity Incentive Plan"). On May 15, 2008, our shareholders also approved the Long Term Equity Incentive Plan. The Long Term Equity Incentive Plan will replace the Assurant, Inc. 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan; equity grants made on or after May 15, 2008, will be made under the Long Term Equity Incentive Plan.
        As described in Proposal Four of the Proxy Statement, the Long Term Equity Incentive Plan permits us to grant to our employees awards based on shares of our common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (including performance shares), unrestricted stock, restricted stock units (including performance units,and dividend equivalents. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Long T erm Equity Incentive Plan is 3,400,000. The Long Term Equity Incentive Plan also authorizes our Compensation Committee to establish performance goals, based on criteria approved by our shareholders, in connection with the grant of awards, and to determine that performance shares or performance units are intended to be exempt from the limits on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Long Term Equity Incentive Plan has a term of ten years; however, for any performance shares or performance units granted after our stockholder meeting in 2013 to be exempt from Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, we will have to seek reapproval of the performance goals in 2013.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  July 31, 2008  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the second quarter and first six months of 2008.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said: "Despite a slowing economy and uncertain capital markets, Assurant had a solid quarter and strong first half of 2008. We delivered double digit growth in net operating income on both a quarterly and year to date basis and generated an operating return on equity well in excess of 15%both key metrics for Assurant."
"Our solid results this quarter and for the first half of 2008 continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified specialty insurance platform. We continue to execute our strategy and are financially well positioned for the opportunities and challenges arising from the changing economic landscape," Mr. Pollock concluded.
Second Quarter Results
Net income in the second quarter of 2008 increased 14% to $190.0 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, versus net income of $166.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. The second quarter of 2008 included a gain of $26.6 million after-tax from the sale of an inactive subsidiary and $22.4 million of net after-tax realized losses on investments including $17.9 million from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the second quarter of 2008 increased 10% to $185.8 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $168.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2007.
Net earned premiums of $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2008 increased 11% from $1.8 billion in the same period of 2007, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the second quarter of 2008 increased 6% to $201.2 million from $190.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. The second quarter of 2008 benefited from an increase in average invested assets.
Six-Month Results
Net income in the first half of 2008 was $376.8 million, or $3.16 per diluted share, an increase of 9% versus first half 2007 net income of $345.7 million, or $2.80 per diluted share. Net income for the first six months of 2008 included a gain of $26.6 million after-tax from the sale of an inactive subsidiary and $50.5 million of net after-tax realized losses on investments, including $46.1 million from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio.
Net operating income for the first half of 2008 was $400.7 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, an increase of 16% versus first half 2007 net operating income of $344.1 million, or $2.79 per diluted share.
Net earned premiums of $3.9 billion in the first half of 2008 represent an 11% increase over first half 2007 net earned premiums of $3.6 billion, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the first half of 2008 decreased 2% to $399.0 million from $407.2 million in the first half of 2007. This was attributable to a decrease of $33.1 million in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships in the first six months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The first six months of 2008 benefited from an increase in average invested assets.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2008 net operating income was $32.4 million, up 7% from second quarter 2007 net operating income of $30.2 million. The increase for the quarter was driven by favorable domestic loss experience. This was offset by a $6.9 million after-tax charge related to losses from a credit life product in Brazil. The second quarter of 2007 benefited from $3.6 million after-tax relating to three items: $3.5 million in fees from the sale of the U.S. Preneed independent franchise, $4.5 million of income resulting from a project to improve the reconciliation of client commission payable accounts, and a $4.4 million charge related to a credit life product in Brazil. Net operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $79.9 million, up 8% from $74.3 million for the first six months of 2007. Results for the six months benefited from improved domestic loss experience and $11.7 million of after-tax income from contract-related settlements with domestic service contract clients. This improvement was offset by continued investment in international operations and a decrease of $9.3 million after-tax of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared to the first half of 2007.
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 13% to $700.6 million from $618.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2008 were $1.4 billion, up 15% from $1.2 billion for the first six months of 2007. The increases for the quarter and the first six months were primarily driven by continued growth in the domestic and international service contracts; growth in preneed primarily from the July 2007 acquisition of Mayflower National Life
 
Insurance Company; and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange. Results were offset by a continued decline in premiums related to the domestic independent runoff in preneed and domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2008 net operating income was $131.0 million, up 45% from $90.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $255.8 million, up 55% from $164.6 for the first six months of 2007. The increases for the quarter and first six months were primarily driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, continued favorable combined ratios and an increase in investment income. Assurant historically reported Insurance Services Office (ISO) catastrophe related losses in excess of $5 million per event and this quarter no single event reached that threshold. However, there was an unusually high frequency of ISO events in the second quarter of 2008 which resulted in $11.5 million after-tax of catastrophe related losses in comparison to $3.4 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter 2007 included income of $5.5 million after-tax from a project to improve the reconciliation of client commission payable accounts.
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 36% to $533.9 million compared to $393.6 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premium for the first six months of 2008 increased 33% to $1.0 billion compared to $760.7 million for the first six months of 2007. The increases for the quarter and first six months are primarily due to the continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2008 net operating income was $27.7 million, a decrease of 18% compared to second quarter 2007 net operating income of $33.8 million. Net operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $65.0 million, a decrease of 13% compared to $74.4 million for the first six months of 2007. The decreases for the quarter and first six months were primarily driven by a continued decline in small group medical premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to less favorable individual medical loss experience.
Assurant Health second quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $487.7 million from $513.9 million in the second quarter of 2007. The continued decline in small group medical premiums was accompanied by a 1% decrease in individual medical premiums during the second quarter. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2008 decreased 4% to $983.8 million compared to $1.0 billion for the first six months of 2007. For the first six months of 2008, small group medical premiums were down 14% while individual medical premiums grew slightly.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2008 net operating income was $18.6 million, down 13% from second quarter 2007 net operating income of $21.5 million. Net operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $35.0 million, down 31% from $50.4 million for the first six months of 2007. Results for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 are lower as a result of less favorable loss experience compared to the same period in 2007. In addition, investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships declined $9.1 million after-tax in the first six months of 2008 compared to the first six months of 2007.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased slightly to $273.2 million compared to $272.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2008 decreased 3% to $553.7 million from $569.1 million in the first six months of 2007. Results for the first six months of 2008 included $5.5 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business compared to $22.8 million in the first six months of 2007.
Corporate and other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2008 was $18.8 million, compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2007. Higher losses for the quarter were mainly due to a decline of $2.3 million after-tax in investment income and $3.0 million of after-tax expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. The second quarter 2007 results included $2.9 million of tax benefit from the change in certain tax liabilities. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first six months of 2008 was $24.7 million compared to a loss of $10.5 million for the first six months of 2007. The increase in net operating loss was mainly due to a decline of $5.1 million after-tax in investment income and $4.6 million of after-tax expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. Results for the first six months of 2007 were negatively impacted by $2.9 million of tax expense from the change in certain tax liabilities.
Financial Position
Our strength is reflected in our financial position. At June 30, 2008 total assets were $26.2 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), was $4.4 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 9% to $36.68 from $33.73 at December 31, 2007. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 18.3% from 19.7% at December 31, 2007.

Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Assurant Strengthens Position in Wireless Service Contract Market by Acquiring Wireless Handset Service Provider Signal Holdings
NEW YORK/WAYNE, PA, July 31-- Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Signal Holdings LLC, a leading provider of wireless handset protection programs and repair services, to acquire the company's outstanding capital stock for $250 million in an all cash transaction from Trident II, L.P. and Signal Holdings' management.

Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer said: "Assurant continues to target opportunities which we believe offer long term growth opportunities to our shareholders, and this acquisition improves our position in the service contract market for wireless handsets. Success of this deal will be measured by our ability to increase our market position in this growing market. The deal should be accretive to earnings beginning in 2010 after we have completed the integration of Signal into Assurant Solutions."
S. Craig Lemasters, president and chief executive officer of Assurant Solutions said: "This transaction expands Assurant Solutions' client portfolio and servicing capabilities in the wireless marketplace. In addition, we add an experienced management team and an outstanding customer service organization to Assurant Solutions, which is consistent with our goal of providing a total solution to our clients by integrating all aspects of the customer experience.
Tom Cloetingh, president and chief executive officer of Signal Holdings said: "Assurant Solutions has been a great partner for nearly eight years, and we are looking forward to becoming part of the company. Assurant brings scale to the business, in terms of product innovation, marketing expertise and financial stability. That's essential to growing and establishing new client relationships in the wireless industry."

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Assurant Purchases 1 Million Shares of Company's Common Stock from Fortis
NEW YORK, August 7, 2008 - Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today announced that it has purchased 1 million of its common shares from Fortis Insurance N.V. at a price, including transaction fees, of $59.00 per share for a total of $59.0 million. The $59.00 per share price compares to the Company's closing price of $59.49 on August 6, 2008. The shares were purchased in a private aftermarket block transaction.
Robert Pollock, CEO and President of Assurant said, "We are pleased by this opportunity to repurchase shares. It is consistent with our capital management strategy and benefits our shareholders. It demonstrates the strength of our capital position following our recently announced intention to expand our Solutions business by signing an agreement to acquire Signal Holdings LLC, a leading provider of wireless handset protection programs and repair services.
"In addition to a strong capital position, Assurant continues to execute effectively on its specialty strategy. For the first half of the year Assurant demonstrated both a double digit growth in net earned premiums and net operating income. We also raised our dividend in May," added Pollock.
In September 2007 the Company announced the suspension of its stock buyback program in light of the Company's continuing involvement with the SEC Staff's investigation into certain loss mitigation products. The Company said that this purchase of shares from Fortis does not constitute a resumption of its buyback program, which remains on hold. The Company continues to evaluate the potential to implement a new buyback program.
Assurant was created through an initial public offering by Fortis on February 5, 2004. On January 28, 2008 Fortis distributed 18,851,690 shares of Assurant common stock to holders of mandatorily exchangeable bonds. Following this transaction, Fortis owned 4,147,400 shares.

Assurant to Acquire GE Consumer & Industrial's Warranty Management Group
 
NEW YORK, September 4, 2008 -- Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with GE Consumer & Industrial, a unit of General Electric (NYSE:GE), for Assurant to acquire GE's Warranty Management Group (WMG) business, a unit that markets and sells extended warranties and service contracts for major appliances and consumer electronics. As part of the definitive agreement, Assurant will also enter into a new 10-year agreement to market extended warranties and service contracts on GE-branded major appliances domestically.
In 2003, Assurant Solutions and GE, two respected leaders in the extended service contract market, entered into an alliance whereby Assurant offered extended warranties directly to GE appliance purchasers and through leading retailers for consumer electronics, computers, appliances and other goods and services. Under the terms of the new agreement, Assurant will now assume full responsibility for operating the extended warranty business it previously co-managed and shared with GE. The terms also call for GE Factory Service Technicians to continue to provide in-home service on the Assurant extended warranties sold with GE appliances.
Under terms of the agreement, Assurant will pay GE $140 million in cash for the sale, transfer, and conveyance of certain assets and will assume certain liabilities. As part of the transaction, GE will pay Assurant $115 million in cash for the assumption of certain obligations.
Assurant expects that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2009. Assurant has provided the underwriting in its existing partnership with GE. Therefore, the acquisition will not change Assurant's reported premiums. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2008 subject to customary regulatory approvals.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "We continue to diversify our specialty business by deploying capital in areas where we see good growth potential, such as the extended service contract market. We've targeted this specialty niche because of its growth attributes and because it enables us to leverage our core capability of working closely with industry leaders, like GE."
Craig Lemasters, president and chief executive officer, Assurant Solutions, said: "We are delighted to deepen our relationship with GE. This agreement strengthens Assurant's leadership in the service contract market and enhances our ability to integrate the value chain and provide a broader solution to our clients. Assurant and GE share a common, customer-centric approach and we are committed to making this transaction seamless to our customers. Current extended warranty customers will continue to receive the same high quality services and extended warranty protection they have come to expect."
Extended service contracts and extended warranties provide consumers with peace of mind by protecting them from untimely problems associated with big-ticket purchases. Assurant Solutions, part of Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ) provides service plans through more than 10,000 retail stores in the United States. Its programs cover a wide range of products, including home appliances, consumer electronics, motor vehicles, fitness equipment, furniture, jewelry, lawn and garden equipment, personal computers and wireless and mobile devices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Assurant Estimates Impact of Recent Hurricane Activity; Financial Market Developments
NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2008 -- Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today released an estimate of losses resulting from hurricanes Gustav and Ike as well as the impact of the recent financial market developments on certain holdings within its investment portfolio.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "While Assurant has not been immune to the recent turmoil befalling the U.S. financial markets or an active hurricane season, we continue to have a solid balance sheet, a strong excess capital position, a conservative disciplined investment philosophy and a unique specialty business model that will continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders."
Hurricane Experience
To date, Assurant has incurred paid and case reserves of approximately $21 million on hurricane Gustav, and estimates total claims to be in the range of $40 to $60 million. The Company anticipates claims generated by hurricane Ike will likely reach the Company's $95 million retention limit, at which time the Company's catastrophe reinsurance program will take effect. The Company expects that claims from hurricane Ike will fall well within its reinsurance coverage limits, which would cover a $770 million catastrophe event. As part of the current catastrophic reinsurance program, the Company has an automatic reinstatement for a second event under terms similar to the current program.
Investment Portfolio
Amid the recent and dramatic changes within the financial markets, Assurant has realized approximately $42.5 million gross pre-tax investment losses since the second quarter close as it has repositioned portions of the investment portfolio in response to market events. Assurant expects to record other than temporary impairments for the third quarter, subject to the Company's quarterly impairment review. The Company anticipates that the impairments will be concentrated primarily in preferred stock holdings, and will include but not be limited to those listed in the table below. Total preferred stock investments at the end of the second quarter 2008 were approximately $750 million on a book value basis, which represented only 5% of the $14 billion investment portfolio.
Listed in the table below, are investments at book value of select financial companies within the Company's investment portfolio. These represent bond and preferred stock holdings as the Company owns no common equity in these companies. In the unlikely event that there is no recovery from all of these investments, the estimated impact would result in a $1.40 reduction in Assurant's pro forma book value per share. In summary, the investments listed below represent less than 2% of the Company's diversified investment portfolio.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  October 30, 2008  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the third quarter of 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said:Assurant demonstrated resilience, an essential quality for any business during turbulent times. Despite unprecedented volatility in the capital markets and a very active hurricane season we continued to execute on our diversified specialty strategy. We were pleased to complete two important acquisitions during the quarter."
"
"A changing environment creates opportunities and our solid capital position and disciplined risk management have us positioned to evaluate and respond to situations to create long term value for our shareholders," Mr. Pollock concluded.
Third Quarter Results
Assurant's net loss in the third quarter of 2008 was $111.4 million, or ($0.95) per diluted share, compared to net income of $187.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share in the third quarter 2007. Net income declined primarily due to investment impairments and reportable catastrophe losses. The Company had $194.5 million after-tax of net realized investment losses, which included $148.9 million after-tax of other-than- temporary impairments in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $8.5 million of net
after-tax realized losses on investments in the third quarter of 2007. Assurant incurred $86.2 million after-tax in reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in an active hurricane season. This is in contrast to an exceptionally benign catastrophe season in the third quarter of 2007, during which there were no reportable catastrophe losses.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the third quarter of 2008 decreased 58% to $83.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 net operating income of $195.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. The decrease was primarily the result of reportable catastrophe-related losses for Assurant Specialty Property and less favorable results from Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health.
Net earned premiums of $1.98 billion in the third quarter of 2008 increased 5% from $1.89 billion in the third quarter of 2007, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the third quarter of 2008 decreased 1% to $192.3 million from $194.0 million in the third quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of a decrease in average invested assets and an increase in the percentage of our investment portfolio allocated to tax-advantaged assets.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first nine months of 2008 was $265.4 million, or $2.23 per diluted share, a decrease of 50%, compared to net income of $532.9 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007. Net income declined primarily due to investment impairments and reportable catastrophe losses. Results include $244.9 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments, including $195.1 million after-tax of other-than-temporary impairments, compared to $6.9 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments in the first nine months of 2007. In addition, Assurant had $86.2 million after-tax in reportable catastrophe losses from hurricanes Gustav and Ike and reported $11.5 million of after tax catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2008. In the second quarter 2008, the Company reported Insurance Services Office (ISO) catastrophe related losses excluding incurred but not reported losses due to the high frequency of storms. This was in contrast to a benign catastrophe season in the nine months of 2007, during which Assurant had no reportable catastrophe losses. Results for the first nine months of 2008 include $26.6 million after-tax gain from the sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2008 was $483.7 million, or $4.06 per diluted share, a decrease of 10% compared to net operating income of $539.8 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007. Net operating income excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring items.
Net earned premiums of $5.92 billion in the first nine months of 2008 increased 9% from $5.45 billion in the first nine months of 2007 primarily from growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
 
Net investment income in the first nine months of 2008 decreased 2% to $591.3 million from $601.2 million in the first nine months of 2007 primarily resulting from a decrease in average invested assets and an increase in the percentage of our investment portfolio allocated to tax-advantaged assets. Income from real estate joint venture partnerships in the first nine months of 2008 was $3.5 million compared with $37.0 million in the first nine months of 2007. Investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships is disclosed by segment (page 8, 9, 12, and 14) in our financial supplement.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2008 net operating income was $20.4 million, a 45% decrease from third quarter 2007 net operating income of $37.4 million. Results for the third quarter 2008 declined primarily as a result of higher domestic and international combined ratios. Domestic combined ratios increased in the quarter primarily as a result of an $11.8 million pre-tax charge from the acquisition of GE's Warranty Management Group and less favorable domestic service contract loss experience. The international combined ratio increased to 105.6% as a result of less favorable credit insurance loss experience in the United Kingdom and higher expenses in developing countries in the third quarter of 2008. These increases were partially offset by favorable client settlements related to reserves previously established for a credit life product in Brazil. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2008 was $100.3 million, down 10% from $111.7 million for the first nine months of 2007. Results for the first nine months of 2008 declined primarily due to less favorable loss experience in our international business and higher expenses in our developing countries. Results for the first nine months of 2008 had $9.4 million less of after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared to the same period in 2007.
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected our quarterly results by segment for the last seven quarters can be found in our financial supplement on page 19.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 9% to $707.1 million from $649.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2008 were $2.09 billion, up 13% from $1.85 billion for the first nine months of 2007. The increase for the quarter and first nine months of 2008 was primarily driven by continued growth in domestic and international service contracts and growth in preneed. Results were partially offset by a continued decline in premiums related to the domestic independent runoff in preneed and domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2008 net operating income was $30.9 million, down 73% from $114.7 million in the third quarter 2007. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by an active hurricane season resulting in $86.2 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, from large hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $8.6 million after-tax of catastrophe reinsurance re-instatement premiums and related expenses. Third quarter 2007 results included income of $2.3 million after-tax from a project to improve the reconciliation of certain client commissions payable accounts. Despite reported catastrophe losses of $97.7 million net of reinsurance for the nine months, net operating income for the first nine months of 2008 increased 3% to $286.7 million compared to $279.3 million in 2007 due to growth in our creditor-placed homeowners insurance. There were no reportable catastrophe losses during the third quarter or the first nine months of 2007 due to an exceptionally benign hurricane season.
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter net earned premiums increased 15%, to $513.2 million compared to $445.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2008 increased 27% to $1.53 billion compared to $1.21 billion for the same period in 2007. The third quarter and nine months of 2008 include increased reinsurance costs of $26.6 million for the quarter and $17.5 million for the year, including reinstatement premiums of $13.2 million for third quarter and year to date. The increases for the quarter and the first nine months are primarily the result of continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance as average insured values increased 15% to $173,000 in the quarter and policy penetration rates continue to rise. Partially offsetting these factors was a net decrease in tracked loans in the period due to continued market consolidation and the declining inventory of subprime loans.
 
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2008 net operating income was $30.2 million, a decrease of 23% compared to third quarter 2007 net operating income of $39.4 million. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2008 was $95.2 million, a decrease of 16% compared to $113.7 million for the first nine months of 2007. The decrease for the quarter and first nine months in 2008 was driven primarily by the continued decline in small group medical premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to less favorable individual medical loss experience.
Assurant Health third quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $486.7 million from $514.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2008 decreased 5% to $1.47 billion compared to $1.54 billion for the first nine months of 2007. Individual medical premiums for the quarter and first nine months of 2008 were down slightly while small group premiums declined by 15% for the quarter and by 14% for the nine months.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2008 net operating income was $21.5 million, up 5% from third quarter 2007 net operating income of $20.4 million. Results for the third quarter of 2008 benefited from favorable loss experience compared to the prior year's quarter. Net operating income during the first nine months of 2008 was $56.4 million, down 20% from $70.8 million in the first nine months of 2007. Results for the first nine months of 2008 are lower as a result of $9.2 million less of after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and less favorable loss experience compared to the same period in 2007.
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $277.1 million from $284.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2008 decreased 3% to $830.8 million from $853.2 million in the first nine months of 2007. Net earned premiums for the third quarter of 2007 include $12.3 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2008 included $5.5 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business compared to $35.1 million in the first nine months of 2007. Excluding single premiums from closed blocks of business, net earned premiums increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2008.
 
Corporate and other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2008 was $14.8 million, compared to a loss of $11.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. Losses increased in the third quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower net investment income and $4.0 million in tax expenses resulting from changes in certain tax liabilities. Assurant incurred $2.1 million of after-tax expenses related to the SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products; however Assurant also received a $2.1 million after-tax recovery of certain SEC investigation expenses from its director and officer insurance coverage.
For the first nine months of 2008 net operating loss was $39.5 million compared to a loss of $22.1 million for the same period last year. Net operating loss increased as a result of an increase in expenses related to the SEC investigation, lower investment income and higher severance and previously announced supplemental executive retirement plan expenses.
Financial Position
At September 30, 2008 total assets were $25.4 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was $4.2 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 6% to $35.60 from $33.73 at December 31, 2007. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 18.9% compared to 19.7% at December 31, 2007.
AOCI is composed of foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized gains/losses on securities, and pension underfunding. Net unrealized gains and losses represent the after-tax difference between the book value and market value of invested assets. At September 30, 2008, AOCI was ($475.8) million or ($4.03) per diluted share compared to $53.9 million, or $.45 per diluted share, at December 31, 2007, Invested assets at market value, excluding cash and equivalents, as a ratio of shareholders equity including AOCI was 3.4 to 1 at September 30, 2008.
At September 30, 2008 Level 1 and Level 2 investment assets as defined under GAAP accounting rules comprise 98.4% of our total investment portfolio.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 11.2% and 9.0%, respectively. Please refer to page 6 of the financial supplement for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP ROE.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEW YORK, Nov. 6, 2008 -- Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today announced that it has reinstated its share buyback program, effective Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2008.
Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our first priority is to maintain our solid capital position during a period of unprecedented market volatility. However, we believe the benefit of our diverse specialty business model is not fully reflected in our stock price and remains a compelling driver of shareholder value. Our buyback program will be structured to provide flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. Therefore, we expect to limit potential repurchases to approximately $30 million between November 11, 2008 and January 31, 2009, subject to a meaningful improvement in the credit markets."
In September 2007, Assurant announced the suspension of its stock buyback program in light of the ongoing SEC Staff's investigation into certain loss mitigation products. The reinstatement of the stock buyback program does not imply any change in the status of the ongoing SEC Staff's investigation, nor can the company predict the potential outcome of the investigation. The reinstatement of the stock buyback program, which has a remaining authorization of $201 million aggregate repurchase amount, may utilize open market and/or private transactions. The amount and timing of the repurchases will depend upon market conditions.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") estimates total claims resulting from recent California wildfires to be in the range of $10 to 12 million pre-tax, which the Company does not consider to be material to its operations. Base pre-tax 2008 reinsurance premiums, which are a reduction to net earned premiums, were estimated to be $129 million in 2008 when the property catastrophe reinsurance program was announced. Given the growth of the business, base premiums in 2008 are now estimated to be $147 million. The Company expects base reinsurance costs in the fourth quarter to be relatively consistent with third quarter amounts of approximately $40 million.
In 2008, the Company secured its property catastrophe reinsurance program by purchasing a portion of the coverage in both January and June. The June reinsurance purchase included a small portion of coverage for a two year term. The Company is in the process of securing coverage for the 2009 reinsurance program. In structuring the program, the Company applies a disc iplined risk management process which includes utilizing multiple catastrophe models to evaluate the estimated loss potential from various perils, analyzing the geographic spread of risk and evaluating the reinsurance cost relative to the coverage provided. The Company also evaluates the credit quality, financial strength and claims-paying ability of the reinsurers. Given the growth of the Company's property businesses, the Company anticipates buying more coverage and adjusting the retention for the growth of the business.
The Company utilizes catastrophe reinsurance primarily for its Assurant Specialty Property business to protect the Company's capital base from catastrophe risk for its customers and to lessen the variable effect of catastrophes on earnings for shareholders.

(e)        As a result of the expiration of its previously existing change in control agreements on December 31, 2008, and as a continuation of that pre-existing program, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") entered into new change of control agreements, effective as of January 1, 2009 (the "COC Agreements"), with several senior executives, including the following named executive officers: Messrs. Pollock, Peninger and Lemasters and Ms. Silvester. The new forms were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors on November 13, 2008. The COC Agreements are materially consistent with the Company's previously disclosed change in control agreements, except for the modifications noted below.
To provide further benefit to the Company and its shareholders, the COC Agreements now include restrictions on competition and solicitation. Under the COC Agreements, the senior executive may not engage in activity competitive with the Company (including as an employee or officer of a competitor) or solicit customers of the Company during the period beginning on January 1, 2009 and expiring on the date of a change of control. If the senior executive's employment is terminated before a change of control occurs, the length of the applicable non-competition period varies based on the type of termination. Specifically, if the senior executive's employment is terminated by the Company for cause or by the senior executive without good reason, the non-competition period will expire six months after the date of termination. If the senior executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the senior executive for good reason, the non-competition period will expire on the date of termination.
Under the COC Agreements, senior executives also may not employ or offer to employ officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during the period beginning on January 1, 2009 and ending one year after the date of termination of the senior execu tive's employment.
To bring the COC Agreements into compliance with the new Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the payment of the Executive Short Term Incentive Plan ("ESTIP") award for the year in which the date of termination occurs will now be equal to 0.5 times the target annual ESTIP award (as opposed to a pro rata award).

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York- February 4, 2009 - Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "Although we can't avoid the chill of the economic global cooling,' Assurant's capital position remains stable and our balance sheet remains solid, setting us apart, despite the unprecedented challenges in the economy. In 2008, despite an active storm season, we were able to grow revenues and expand through strategic acquisitions. We continue to believe our diverse specialty business model serves us well, and enables us to be nimble and flexible as we adapt."
"We are maintaining a prudent, defensive approach to our investment portfolio and capital planning. Although we are not immune to the impact of the economic environment, we are effectively mixing offense and defense to strengthen the company and better position Assurant for both the near and long term," Mr. Pollock concluded.
 
Fourth Quarter Results
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased less than 1% to $153.7 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $154.4 million, or $1.29 per diluted share.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 51% to $182.4 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 net income of $120.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. The Company incurred $33.7 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments, which included $26.0 million after-tax of other than temporary impairments in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $33.6 million of after-tax net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 benefited by $62.4 million from the realization of a tax asset related to the second quarter 2008 sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2007, driven mostly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 7% to $183.0 million from $197.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of a decrease in average invested assets and lower yields.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income in 2008 was $637.4 million, or $5.36 per diluted share, a decrease of 8% compared to net operating income of $694.2 million, or $5.72 per diluted share, in 2007. Results in 2008 included $102.8 million after-tax of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance compared to $22.2 million after-tax in 2007.
Net income in 2008 was $447.8 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, a decrease of 32% compared to net income of $653.7 million, or $5.38 per diluted share in 2007. Net income in 2008 includes $278.6 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments, including $221.1 million from
 
other than temporary impairments, compared to $40.5 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments in 2007. Net income in 2008 was favorably impacted by $89.0 million of a tax benefit and gain related to the second quarter 2008 sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums in 2008 were $7.93 billion, an increase of 7% from $7.41 billion in 2007. Growth in net earned premiums was driven mainly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in 2008 decreased 3% to $774.3 million from $799.1 million in 2007 primarily resulting from a decrease in average invested assets and $3.9 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared with $37.2 million in 2007.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $11.9 million, a 63% decrease from fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $32.3 million. Results for the fourth quarter 2008 decreased due to the following factors: 1) the Company's decision to exit business operations in Denmark, which resulted in a $9.7 million after-tax closing charge;
 
2) charges of $8.1 million after-tax as a result of client bankruptcies; 3) continued unfavorable United Kingdom loss experience; and 4) a decline in investment income of $5.8 million after-tax. The fourth quarter also includes a $5.9 million after-tax benefit from the final accounting of the third quarter acquisition of GE's Warranty Management Group. Net operating income for the full year 2008 was $112.2 million, a decrease of 22% from 2007. In addition to the items which impacted the fourth quarter, 2008 results were less than 2007 due to a $9.3 million after-tax decrease in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships.
A schedule of disclosed items that affected our quarterly results by segment for the last eight quarters can be found in the financial supplement on page 19.
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 6% to $722.2 million from $678.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by continued growth in domestic and international service contracts. Net earned premiums for 2008 were $2.81 billion, up 11% from $2.53 billion for 2007. The increase for 2008 was primarily driven by continued growth in service contracts and preneed. Results were partially offset by a continued decline in premiums related to the domestic independent runoff in preneed and domestic credit insurance as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against international currencies.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $118.5 million, up 19% from $99.9 million in the fourth quarter 2007. The quarterly increase was primarily the result of growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance and continued favorable combined ratios. The fourth quarter 2008 results were impacted by $5.1 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, from the California wildfires compared to $22.2 million after-tax for the same period in 2007. Results for the fourth quarter 2007 were favorably impacted by $5.9 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project. Net operating income in 2008 increased 7% to $405.2 million compared to $379.2 million in 2007 driven primarily by growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. Results in 2008 increased despite $102.8 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance. Results in 2007 included $22.2 million after-tax of catastrophe losses and benefited by $13.7 million of after-tax income from a client commission reconciliation project.
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 9% to $519.7 million compared to $476.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the full year 2008 increased 22% to $2.05 billion compared to $1.68 billion in 2007. These increases were primarily the result of continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance as average insured values and policy placement rates continue to increase. Partially
 
offsetting these factors was a net decrease in tracked loans due to continued market consolidation, and an overall decline in subprime loans.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $25.1 million, a decrease of 34% compared to fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $38.0 million. Results in the fourth quarter of 2007 were favorably impacted by $2.5 million after-tax from a favorable legal settlement. Net operating income for 2008 was $120.3 million, a decrease of 21% compared to $151.7 million for 2007. The decreases for the quarter and year were driven primarily by the continued decline in small group medical premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to less favorable individual medical loss experience.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $481.5 million from $509.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for 2008 decreased 5% to $1.95 billion compared to $2.05 billion for 2007. The decreases for the quarter and year were due to declines in small group medical premiums of 15% and 14%, respectively, and declines in individual medical premiums of 2% and 1%, respectively.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $14.1 million, down 13% from fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $16.2 million. Results for the fourth quarter 2008 were impacted by $2.1 million after-tax of lower investment income and a slightly higher loss ratio, partially offset by a reserve release of $3.5 million after-tax resulting from an annual reserve study and lower operating expenses. Net operating income for 2008 was $70.6 million, down 19% from 2007 net operating income of $87.0 million. Results for the year are lower as a result of $9.2 million less after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and slightly higher loss experience compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter 2007 also included a $2.1 million charge to reflect New York State's clarification of certain disability contract provisions.
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 4% to $281.0 million from $291.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for 2008 decreased 3% to $1.11 billion from $1.14 billion in 2007. Results for the fourth quarter of 2008 include $5.9 million in single premium from closed blocks of business compared to $14.3 million in fourth quarter 2007. Results for 2008 include $11.4 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business compared to $49.5 million in 2007.
 
Corporate & other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $10.8 million, compared to a net operating loss of $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The difference includes a net decrease of $6.0 million in after-tax expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. Fourth quarter 2007 results also included $6.4 million of net tax expense associated with changes in tax liabilities.
Net operating loss for 2008 was $50.4 million compared to a loss of $49.4 million for 2007. The slight increase in net operating loss was primarily due to a decline of $7.6 million after-tax of investment income, partially offset by $3.9 million after-tax of income from the reimbursement of certain SEC investigation-related expenses through director and executive officer insurance coverage.
Financial Position
At December 31, 2008 total assets were $24.5 billion. Total stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was $4.4 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 10% to $37.21 from $33.73 at December 31, 2007. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 18.3% compared to 19.7% at December 31, 2007.
AOCI consists of foreign currency conversion translation adjustments, net unrealized gains/losses on securities, and benefit plan obligations. Net unrealized gains and losses represent the after-tax difference between the book value and market value of invested assets. At December 31, 2008, AOCI was ($670.9) million or ($5.70) per diluted share compared to $53.9 million, or $.45 per diluted share, at December 31, 2007. Invested assets at market value, excluding cash and equivalents, as a ratio of stockholders' equity, including AOCI was 3.3 to 1 at December 31, 2008.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months and year ended December, 2008 was 19.6% and 11.5%, respectively. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e) On February 17, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Assurant,Inc. (the "Company") adopted certain forms of equity award agreements for use in granting awards under the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "ALTEIP"). The following descriptions of these forms of equity award agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable plan documents previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. The form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for time-based awards provides for the award of restricted stock units ("RSUs") that vest in three equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the participant's continuous employment with the Company through the applicable vesting dates. RSUs are settled in shares of the Company's common stock no later than 30 days following the applicable vesting date and are credited with dividend equivalents that are paid i n cash no later than 45 calendar days following the record date for the related cash dividend. RSUs will fully vest upon a Change of Control (as defined in the ALTEIP). Participants are not entitled to voting rights with respect to any RSUs.
Upon a termination of employment (i) due to retirement following the end of the calendar year in which the grant date occurs, all unvested RSUs will fully vest; (ii) by the Company without cause or due to death or disability, vesting will be determined on a pro rata basis; or (iii) for any other reason, all unvested RSUs will be forfeited without payment.
Performance-Conditioned Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. The form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for performance-based awards provides for the award of performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") that vest, subject to the employee's continued employment through the third anniversary of the grant date, based upo n the average of the Company's ranked average percentile, for each calendar year included in the performance period beginning on January 1, 2009 and ending on December 31, 2011, with respect to the following goals relative to an index of the Company's peers: growth in earnings per share, growth in revenue and achievement of total shareholder return. Each goal is weighted equally in determining the Company's annual ranked average percentile index performance. The percentage of PSUs that vests ranges from 0% for performance below the 25th percentile of the selected index to 150% for performance at or above the 75th percentile, with vesting for performance that falls between the 25th and 75th percentiles to be determined by straight-line interpolation. PSUs are settled in shares of the Company's common stock no later than 75 days after the end of the performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid in cash at the time of settlement with respect to the shares earned by the participant.   In the event of a Change of Control during the performance period (i) prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, a number of PSUs will vest assuming a level of performance equal to the 50th percentile or (ii) after the first anniversary of the grant date, a number of PSUs will vest assuming a level of performance equal to the greater of (A) the 50th percentile and (B) the actual percentile achieved, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the date of the Change of Control as to which performance can be determined. Participants are not entitled to voting rights with respect to any PSUs.
Upon a termination of employment (i) due to retirement, all PSUs other than those granted in the year of retirement will vest; or (ii) by the Company without cause or due to death or disability, vesting will be determined on a pro rata basis; subject, in each case, to the level of performance achieved for the performance period. Upon a termination of employment for any other reason, all PSUs w ill be forfeited without payment.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) and (c).    On March 9, 2009, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the resignation of P. Bruce Camacho as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective March 15, 2009, and the appointment of Michael J. Peninger as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective March 15, 2009. A copy of the press release announcing Mr. Camacho's resignation and Mr. Peninger's appointment is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Prior to his appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Peninger, age 54, had served as Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company beginning in July 2007, when, as previously disclosed, Mr. Camacho began an administrative leave from the Company after receiving a "Wells Notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), in connection with an industry investigation of certain loss mitigation insurance products. Prior to serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Peninger had served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Assurant Employee Benefits, a business unit of the Company, starting in January 1999. Mr. Peninger began his career at Northwestern National Life in 1977 as an actuary. He then joined Assurant Employee Benefits in 1985 as a corporate actuary and held various positions within Assurant Employee Benefits. In 1991, Mr. Peninger was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Assurant Employee Benefits, and in 1993 he became Senior Vice President of Finance and Claims of Assurant Employee Benefits. In 1998, Mr. Peninger was appointed an Executive Vice President of the Company.
No decisions have been made regarding any changes to Mr. Peninger's compensation in connection with his appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is no pre-existing arrangement or understanding that required that Mr. Peninger be selected as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Other than a previously disclosed Change of Control Employment Agreement, Mr. Peninger does not have an employment agreement with the Company, and none is being entered into in connection with his appointment.
(e).    In connection with Mr. Camacho's resignation, the Company entered into a Separation Agreement with Mr. Camacho, dated March 3, 2009 (the "Separation Agreement"). Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Camacho will receive (i) cash severance payments totaling $5,000,000, to be paid in six monthly installments beginning July 2, 2009, in lieu of any other severance payments to which he may be entitled under existing agreements or plans (in aggregate, the "Severance Payment"); and (ii) reimbursement of his COBRA health benefits for a period of eighteen months following March 15, 2009, his last date of employment (the "Termination Date"). Mr. Camacho will also be paid benefits he has accrued pursuant to the terms of the Company's qualified and non-qualified retirement plans.
Under the Separation Agreement, all of Mr. Camacho's outstanding vested stock appreciation rights ("SARs") shall remain exercisable for ninety days following the Termination Date, pursuant to their terms. Upon exercise, the SARs may be settled by cash payment to Mr. Camacho of an amount for each such SAR equal to the excess of (x) the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise over (y) the exercise price for each SAR so exercised, multiplied by the number of shares represented thereunder. All other SARs and equity awards held by Mr. Camacho that are subject to vesting and
 
are not vested as of the Termination Date shall be cancelled and shall be of no further force or effect.
In the event that the SEC commences a civil complaint alleging that Mr. Camacho has engaged in securities fraud involving the Company (an "SEC Action"), any unpaid installments of the Severance Payment shall not be paid to Mr. Camacho but will instead be deposited into an escrow account pending resolution of the SEC Action. Such amounts, together with any installments of the Severance Payment already paid to Mr. Camacho, may be subject to forfeiture depending on the outcome of the SEC Action. Mr. Camacho has represented that he has not knowingly violated or caused the Company to violate any federal or state securities law.
Mr. Camacho is subject to certain restrictive covenants. Under the Separation Agreement, he shall not: (i) for a period of two years following the Termination Date, solicit or hire any employee of the Company who was employed by the Company as of the Termination Date or within the two month period prior thereto, (ii) for a period of two years following the Termination Date, cause any person doing business or having a business relationship with the Company to alter or terminate such person's relationship with the Company in any way, and (iii) at any time, disclose to third parties any confidential information of the Company or use such information for the benefit of anyone but the Company.
The Company and Mr. Camacho have agreed not to disparage or denigrate one another; however, the Separation Agreement does not limit or prevent either party from providing truthful testimony or statements to governmental, regulatory or law enforcement agencies or in a court of law. The Company and Mr. Camacho also agreed to mutual releases and covenants not to sue, subject to certain exceptions. Mr. Camacho has seven days from the date of execution of the Separation Agreement to revoke the releases and covenants not to sue (in which case he would not receive the Severance Payment).
A copy of the Separation Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Separation Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1.
Mr. Camacho has also agreed to provide certain consulting services to the Company. The terms of the consulting arrangement are governed by a consulting agreement between Mr. Camacho and the Company, effective March 16, 2009 (the "Consulting Agreement"). Under the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Camacho will serve as a consultant to the Company until March 15, 2010 or the agreement's earlier termination (the "Consulting Period"). Mr. Camacho will receive a retainer, payable in arrears, of $100,000 per month, provided that (i) if the Company terminates the Consulting Period for "cause," which includes the occurrence of an event for which Mr. Camacho would forfeit the Severance Payment, the Company shall have no further obligation to pay such retainer after termination, and (ii) if the Company terminates the Consulting Period without "cause," the Company shall be obligated to continue paying such retainer until March 15, 2010. Mr. Camacho also agreed to refrain, during the Consulting Period, from providing services to anyone that competes with the Company in any jurisdiction in which the Company does business.
A copy of the Consulting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Consulting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.2.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
NEW YORK, March 9, 2009  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today announced that Michael J. Peninger, interim chief financial officer, will become executive vice president and chief financial officer. He will succeed P. Bruce Camacho. Assurant's Board of Directors has agreed to Mr. Camacho's request to resign as chief financial officer in order to pursue other opportunities. Both changes will take effect on March 15. Mr. Camacho has also agreed to assist Assurant as a consultant for a 12-month transition period starting March 16.
Mr. Peninger has served as Assurant's interim CFO since July 18, 2007. Previously, he had been president and chief executive officer of Assurant Employee Benefits, beginning in January 1999.
"Mike has demonstrated that he can operate effectively both in leading a business line as well as serving in corporate staff positions during his 23-year career at Assurant. Mike has had broad exposure to our specialty insurance businesses which, combined with his financial expertise, makes him the ideal candidate to lead Assurant's financial operations," said Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer.
Assurant also named John S. Roberts president and chief executive officer, Assurant Employee Benefits, effective March 15. Mr. Roberts had assumed these roles on an interim basis when Mr. Peninger was appointed Assurant's interim CFO.
"John is a seasoned executive who is highly respected in the employee benefits marketplace. With more than 25 years of experience in the disability, dental, life and
special risk businesses, his leadership has earned him the respect of his peers, both at Assurant and industry-wide," continued Mr. Pollock.
Mr. Peninger was named interim CFO of Assurant after Mr. Camacho was placed on administrative leave by the Company's Board of Directors after he had received a "Wells Notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with an ongoing industry investigation of certain loss mitigation insurance products.
As previously disclosed, on July 17, 2007, Mr. Pollock, Mr. Camacho and Adam Lamnin, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Assurant Solutions / Assurant Specialty Property, each received a "Wells Notice" and was placed on administrative leave by Assurant's Board of Directors. Mr. Pollock was reinstated to his positions by the Board of Directors on January 28, 2008 after Assurant's Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, customers and employees for him to resume leadership of Assurant. Mr. Lamnin will be returning to work with the Company reporting to Mr. Pollock and, initially, assisting with a variety of strategic projects. These developments do not imply any conclusion concerning the outcome of the SEC investigation, which Assurant believes focuses on a catastrophe reinsurance contract between the Company and one reinsurer that commenced over a decade ago and expired in 2004. The SEC staff's inquiry continues, and Assurant continues to cooperate fully.
"In his 18-plus years with Assurant, Bruce has made many significant contributions. His leadership was particularly critical during the acquisition and integration of American Bankers and in establishing the strategic direction for Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property. Bruce was also instrumental with respect to Assurant's public offering in 2004. While we are sad to see him go, we wish Bruce well in what we know will be successful future endeavors. We are pleased we will have the opportunity to continue to work with Bruce during his consulting assignment," concluded Mr. Pollock.
Assurant is a premier provider of specialized insurance products and related services in North America and selected international markets. Its four key businesses  Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits  have partnered with clients who are leaders in their industries and have built leadership positions in a number of specialty insurance market segments worldwide.

1. . (a) . Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of the Grant Date set forth on the cover page hereof the number of Restricted Stock Units (the "Restricted Stock Units"), each with respect to one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per Share ("Common Stock") set forth on the cover page hereof.

The period during which restrictions apply to any Restricted Stock Units is referred to herein as the "Restriction Period".
Vesting During the Restriction Period
(c) . Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason during the Restriction Period, all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to the Participant's Retirement at any time following the end of the calendar year in which the Grant Date occurred, the restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock Units shall immediately lapse, and such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested; and (ii) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period by the Company without Cause, or Termination of Employment due to death or Disability, the Participant shall vest in a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the total number of Restricted Stock Units and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the Restriction Period from the Grant Date until the date of Termination of Employment (provided that, for this purpose, the month in which the Grant Date occurs shall be considered a full month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Restriction Period over (B) the number of Restricted Stock Units that previously vested as of the Termination of Employment without respect to this provision. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with the Company's Affiliates and its successors. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any such Affiliates to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.
Forfeiture; Termination of Employment
2. . As soon as practicable after the date on which the Restriction Period expires, and in no event later than 30 calendar days after such date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant or his or her personal representative, in book-position or certificate form, one Share that does not bear any restrictive legend for each vested Restricted Stock Unit.
Settlement of Units
3. . The Participant shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units that are outstanding under this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents represent the right to receive an amount equal to the aggregate regular cash dividends that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled, cancelled or forfeited of a number of Shares equal to the applicable number of Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, in cash, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 calendar days following, the applicable record date for each such cash dividend.
Dividend Equivalents
4. . During the Restriction Period and until such time as the Restricted Stock Units are ultimately settled as provided in Section 2 above, the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares covered by the Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable by the Participant by means of sale, assignment, exchange, encumbrance, pledge, hedge or otherwise. Any purported or attempted transfer of such Shares or such rights shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of the Restricted Stock Units
5. . During the Restriction Period, the Participant shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting rights).
Rights as a Stockholder
6. . In the event of certain transactions during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4 of the Plan or any applicable successor provision under the Plan. In the event of a Change of Control before the Restricted Stock Units vest, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested, consistent with Section 9.1 of the Plan, and shall be settled within 5 calendar days following the Change of Control; , that any Restricted Stock Units that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code shall not be settled upon such Change of Control unless the Change of Control constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and will instead be settled at such time as specified in Section 2.
Adjustment; Change of Control
provided, however
7. . The Company agrees to pay any and all original issue taxes and stock transfer taxes that may be imposed on the issuance of shares received by a Participant in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, together with any and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.
Payment of Transfer Taxes, Fees and Other Expenses
8. . No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for federal, state, local, foreign income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Restricted Stock Units, the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, all federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws and regulations to be withheld with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 8, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant, including deducting such amount from the delivery of shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that gives rise to the withholding requirement.
Taxes and Withholding
9. . Notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by facsimile, overnight courier, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

Notices and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant consents to electronic delivery of documents required to be delivered by the Company under the securities laws.
10. .

Laws Applicable to Construction; Consent to Jurisdiction
12. . If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included.
Severability
13. . In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control.

Conflicts and Interpretation
14. .

Amendment
15. . It is the intention of the Company that the Restricted Stock Units shall either (a) not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or (b) comply in all respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, such that no delivery of Shares pursuant to this Agreement will result in the imposition of taxation or penalties as a consequence of the application of Section 409A of the Code. Shares in respect of any Restricted Stock Units that (i) constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) vest as a consequence of the Participant's termination of employment shall not be delivered until the date that the Participant incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (or, if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the date that is six months following the date of such "separation from service").

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Assurant, Inc. (Assurant) (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for first quarter 2009.
NEW YORK, April 29, 2009
Net operating income for first quarter 2009 decreased 36 percent to $137.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2008 net operating income of $214.9 million, or $1.80 per diluted share.
"Our quarterly results reflect how the economy is challenging consumers, employers and the financial markets. Yet, in spite of the turbulence, we were able to achieve a quarterly annualized operating ROE of 12.5 percent
2
," says Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer. "Difficult economic conditions triggered increased claim activity. For example, we believe that fears among consumers of potential loss of insurance coverage drove heavy utilization of medical services."
"Even as we feel the economic turbulence of 2009, we are discovering new business opportunities for expansion of products and services both domestically and internationally. Our leading positions in specialty markets, solid balance sheet and conservative investment approach reinforce the strength of our business model and support our long-term strategy to build our diversified specialty insurance businesses."
Net income in the first quarter 2009 decreased 57 percent to $80.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, versus first quarter 2008 net income of $186.8 million, or $1.56 per diluted share. Net income in first quarter 2009 included $36.2 million of after-tax net realized losses on investments, including $16.5 million after-tax from other than temporary impairments. Net income also included $21.0 million of related tax expense caused by a change in deferred tax assets. Net income in first quarter 2008 included $28.0 million of after-tax net realized losses on investments, including $28.2 million after-tax from other than temporary impairments.
Net earned premiums of $1.87 billion in first quarter 2009 decreased 3 percent from the same period in 2008.
Net investment income in first quarter 2009 decreased 10 percent to $178.5 million from $197.8 million in first quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of a decrease in average invested assets and lower yields.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2009 net operating income was $30.3 million, a 36 percent decrease from first quarter 2008 net operating income of $47.6 million. Domestic underwriting experience improved versus first quarter 2008. However, the combined ratio for this business was higher because results in the first quarter of 2008 included $11.7 million of after-tax income from an accrual of contractual receivables for certain domestic service contracts. The international combined ratio was impacted by continued unfavorable loss experience within a United Kingdom credit insurance distribution channel. Results for the quarter also were affected by a decline in investment income of $5.7 million after-tax.
Assurant Solutions first quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 6 percent to $644.6 million from $683.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. The application of FASB 97 for
 
preneed insurance contracts sold in 2009 resulted in $32 million of the decrease but has no impact on net income. Net earned premiums would have increased in the quarter if not for the application of FASB 97 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter 2009 net operating income was $104.7 million, down 16 percent from first quarter 2008 net operating income of $124.7 million. The decrease for the quarter was primarily the result of an additional $8.4 million after-tax of catastrophe reinsurance costs compared to first quarter 2008 and claims activity associated with normal winter weather compared to the mild winter of 2008. Results for the first quarter of 2008 were favorably affected by $4.6 million after-tax from a client-related settlement.
Assurant Specialty Property first quarter net earned premiums increased 3 percent, to $493.8 million compared to $481.4 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily the result of organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance as average insured values and policy placement rates continue to increase. Partially offsetting these factors was a 3.6 percent, or 1.1 million net decrease in tracked loans compared to same period last year, primarily in sub-prime mortgages.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health first quarter 2009 net operating income was $14.7 million, a 61 percent decrease compared to first quarter 2008 net operating income of $37.3 million. Individual medical and small group claims paid in the first quarter for services rendered in the fourth quarter 2008 were higher, likely the result of changing consumer and provider behavior caused by the deteriorating economic conditions.
Assurant Health first quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $472.3 million from $496.1 million in first quarter of 2008. Individual medical premiums for the first quarter were down 1 percent while small group medical premiums continued to decline and were down 15 percent for the quarter.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2009 net operating income was $7.0 million, down 57 percent from first quarter 2008 net operating income of $16.3 million. Results for first quarter 2009 were affected by the ailing economy which led to a reduction in the number of claimants recovering from disabilities. Results for the quarter also were affected by a decline in investment income of $2.7 million after-tax.
Assurant Employee Benefits first quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 6 percent to $263.8 million from $280.4 million in first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2008 premiums included a $5.5 million single premium from a closed block acquisition. Premium declines were driven primarily by the loss of client relationships in the alternative distribution channel and the lapse of certain larger employer accounts.
 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the first quarter of 2009 was $13.4 million compared to a net operating loss of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increased loss was primarily due to $4.6 million of previously reported compensation related expenses and a decline in investment income caused by lower short-term interest rates.
Financial Position
At March 31, 2009 total assets were $23.8 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), was $4.5 billion. Book value per diluted share was down 2 percent to $30.98 from $31.47, and book value per diluted share excluding AOCI, was up 1 percent to $37.58 from $37.16 at Dec. 31, 2008. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 18.0 percent from 18.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2008. The ratio of total investments to stockholders' equity, including AOCI, was 3.2 to 1 as of March 31, 2009.
"In summary, while we're feeling the impact of the current economic climate, we remain on solid ground strengthened by our diversity and flexibility," concludes Pollock.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 was 8.7% and 18.0%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.

On May 5, 2009, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the entry by certain of its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries") into two reinsurance agreements (the "Reinsurance Agreements") with Ibis Re Ltd., a reinsurance company domiciled in the Cayman Islands ("Ibis Re"), in connection with a fully collateralized catastrophe reinsurance bond program. A copy of the press release describing the transaction is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Ibis Re funded the catastrophe reinsurance coverage through the issuance of two classes of catastrophe bonds in an aggregate amount of $150 million (the "CAT Bonds") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the issuance of the CAT Bonds, Ibis Re set up two insurance trusts to hold certain investments to secure payments to the Subsidiaries under the Reinsurance Agreements and the repayment of principal to the bondholders, as applicable, and entered into two related swap agreements (each a "Swap") with Goldman Sachs International (the "Swap Counterparty").
A Swap may be terminated as a result of certain events, including but not limited to a payment default by the Swap Counterparty, the insolvency of the Swap Counterparty, certain changes in law with regard to the Swap Counterparty, or certain merger transactions involving the Swap Counterparty (each a "Swap Counterparty Event"). In the event of such termination, the Company may elect either to replace the Swap Counterparty and enter into an interim swap agreement (the "Interim Swap Agreement"), acting as an interim swap counterparty opposite Ibis Re, or to appoint another swap counterparty to replace the Swap Counterparty. Following a termination of a Swap as the result of a Swap Counterparty Event, if either the Company or a designated affiliate does not upon two (2) business days notice indicate its intention to enter into the Interim Swap Agreement with Ibis Re or appoint another swap counterparty to replace the Swap Counterparty, then the related class of CAT Bond will be subject to early redemption on the next following quarterly payment date for such CAT Bond.
Copies of the Reinsurance Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(a) In the event of the insolvency of the Ceding Insurer, any payments due to the Ceding Insurer shall be payable directly to the Ceding Insurer or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of the liability of the Ceding Insurer without diminution because of the insolvency of the Ceding Insurer or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Ceding Insurer has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Ceding Insurer shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Ceding Insurer indicating the policy reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Ceding Insurer as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the benefit which may accrue to the company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.
(b) It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Ceding Insurer, the reinsurance under this Reinsurance Agreement shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Ceding Insurer or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by any applicable law or except (1) where this Reinsurance Agreement specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Ceding Insurer or (2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy obligations of the Ceding Insurer as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Ceding Insurer to such payees.
22.1 .
Liability of Officers, Directors, Members, Agents and Employees
(a) No liability shall attain in favor of the Reinsurer against any officer, director, member, agent or employee of the Ceding Insurer but the Reinsurer shall look solely to the assets of the Ceding Insurer for satisfaction of this Reinsurance Agreement.
 
(b) No liability shall attain in favor of the Ceding Insurer against any officer, director, member, agent or employee of the Reinsurer but the Ceding Insurer shall look solely to the assets of the Reinsurer for satisfaction of this Reinsurance Agreement.
22.2 . This Reinsurance Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior negotiations, commitments, agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties or either of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Integration
22.3 . Neither this Reinsurance Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred by any Party (including by operation of law).

Exhibit 10.1
THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of , between Assurant, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Participant").
[]
                    
[]
                    
In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein and the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. . (a) . Subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement (this "Agreement") and the provisions of the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of (the "Grant Date"), Restricted Stock Units (the "Restricted Stock Units"), each with respect to one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per Share ("Common Stock"). All capitalized terms used herein, to the extent not defined, shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Grant, Vesting and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units
Grant
[]
                    
[]
                    
(b) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest, and shall no longer be subject to any restriction, in three substantially equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date.
Vesting during the Restriction Period
(c) . Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason other than death or Disability during the Restriction Period, all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited. Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to death or Disability, the Participant shall vest in, and the Restricted Period shall terminate with respect to, a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the total number of Restricted Stock Units and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the Restriction Period from the Grant Date until the date of Termination of Employment ( that, for this purpose, the month in which the Grant Date occurs shall be considered a full month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Restriction Period over (B) the number of Restricted Stock Units that previously vested as of the Termination of Employment without respect to this provision. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with, or the performance of services for, the Company shall include employment with, or the performance of services for, the Company's Affiliates and its successors. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or to continue to perform services for the Company or any of its Affiliates, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any such Affiliates to terminate the Participant's employment or performance of services at any time.
Forfeiture; Termination of Employment
provided
2. . As soon as practicable after the date on which the Restriction Period expires, and in no event later than 30 calendar days after such date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant or his or her personal representative, in book-position or certificate form, one Share that does not bear any restrictive legend for each vested Restricted Stock Unit.
Settlement of Units
3. . The Participant shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units that are outstanding under this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents represent the right to receive an amount equal to the aggregate regular cash dividends that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled, cancelled or forfeited of a number of Shares equal to the applicable number of Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, in cash, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 calendar days following, the applicable record date for each such cash dividend.
Dividend Equivalents
4. . During the Restriction Period and until such time as the Restricted Stock Units are ultimately settled as provided in Section 2 above, the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares covered by the Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable by the Participant by means of sale, assignment, exchange, encumbrance, pledge, hedge or otherwise. Any purported or attempted transfer of such Shares or such rights shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of the Restricted Stock Units
5. . During the Restriction Period, the Participant shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting rights).
Rights as a Stockholder
6. . In the event of certain transactions during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4 of the Plan or any applicable successor provision under the Plan. In the event of a Change of Control before the Restricted Stock Units vest, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested, consistent with Section 9.1 of the Plan, and shall be settled within 5 calendar days following the Change of Control; , that any Restricted Stock Units that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code shall not be settled upon such Change of Control unless the Change of Control constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and will instead be settled at such time as specified in Section 2.
Adjustment; Change of Control
provided, however
7. . The Company agrees to pay any and all original issue taxes and stock transfer taxes that may be imposed on the issuance of shares received by a Participant in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, together with any and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.
Payment of Transfer Taxes, Fees and Other Expenses
8. . No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for federal, state, local, foreign income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Restricted Stock Units, the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, all federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws and regulations to be withheld with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 8, and the
Taxes and Withholding
 
Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant, including deducting such amount from the delivery of shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that gives rise to the withholding requirement.
9. . Notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by facsimile, overnight courier, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
Notices
If to the Participant:

Assurant, Inc.
One Chase Manhattan Plaza, 41st Floor
New York, New York 10005
Attention: Secretary
or to such other address or facsimile number as any party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance with this Section 9. Notices and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant consents to electronic delivery of documents required to be delivered by the Company under the securities laws.
10. . This Agreement is personal to the Participant and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant's legal representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
Effect of Agreement
11. . The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws, as applied to contracts executed in and performed wholly within the State of Delaware. In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
Laws Applicable to Construction; Consent to Jurisdiction
12. . If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included.
Severability
13. . In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without
Conflicts and Interpretation
 
limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Committee has the power, among others, to (a) interpret the Plan, (b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and (c) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Participant and the Company each acknowledges that this Agreement (together with the Plan) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
14. . The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall materially impair the rights of the Participant without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.
Amendment
15. . It is the intention of the Company that the Restricted Stock Units shall either (a) not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or (b) comply in all respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, such that no delivery of Shares pursuant to this Agreement will result in the imposition of taxation or penalties as a consequence of the application of Section 409A of the Code. Shares in respect of any Restricted Stock Units that (i) constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) vest as a consequence of the Participant's termination of employment shall not be delivered until the date that the Participant incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (or, if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the date that is six months following the date of such "separation from service"). If the Company determines after the Grant Date that an amendment to this Agreement is necessary to ensure the foregoing, it may, notwithstanding Section 14, make such an amendment, effective as of the Grant Date or any later date, without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Plan, in the event that any taxes or penalties are imposed on the Participant by reason of Section 409A of the Code, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that such taxes or penalties shall be the exclusive obligation of the Participant, and the Company shall have no liability therefor.
Section 409A of the Code
16. . The headings of Sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Headings
17. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which together shall constitute one and the same original.
Counterparts
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, as of the date first above written, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by a duly authorized officer and the Participant has hereunto set the Participant's hand.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the second quarter and first six months of 2009.
New York, July 29, 2009
Second Quarter Results
Net income in the second quarter of 2009 increased 2 percent to $193.3 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, versus net income of $190.0 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the second quarter 2008. The second quarter results benefited from $85.0 million of after-tax income related to a legal settlement. Improving credit markets increased the fair value of invested assets and realized losses and other-than-temporary-impairments ("OTTI") were lower.
Net operating income
1
for the second quarter 2009 decreased 47 percent to $99.3 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2008 net operating income of $185.8 million, or $1.55 per diluted share. The decrease was primarily driven by losses at Assurant Health and reduced earnings at Assurant Specialty Property. The results for the quarter also reflect $6.4 million after-tax of restructuring charges.
"We are taking decisive actions throughout Assurant to improve performance, reduce expenses, enhance revenues and best position the company for the long term," says Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO. "Clearly, we are disappointed with the operating results at Assurant Health and are taking steps to correct the situation."
"The good news is that even in a challenging economy our financial position remains strong. We've grown our book value per share and for the six month period achieved double-digit annualized operating return on equity ("ROE")
2
of 10.5 percent. Our disciplined investment and capital management strategies have positioned us to take advantage of investment opportunities when the time is right."
Net earned premiums in the second quarter 2009 were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 6 percent, from $2.0 billion in the same 2008 period, declining across all Assurant businesses.
Net investment income in the second quarter 2009 decreased 13 percent to $174.9 million compared to $201.2 million in the second quarter 2008, reflecting a decline in average invested assets and lower investment yields.
Six-Month Results
Net income in the first half of 2009 was $273.9 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, a decrease of 27 percent versus first half 2008 net income of $376.8 million, or $3.15 per diluted share. The decline is primarily due to lower net operating income and lower tax benefits, despite a $10.3 million after-tax decrease in net realized losses on investments and $85.0 million of after-tax income from the legal settlement.
Net operating income for the first half 2009 was $237.1 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, a decrease of 41 percent versus first half 2008 net operating income of $400.7 million, or $3.35 per diluted share. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced earnings at Assurant Health and Assurant Specialty Property.
Net earned premiums of $3.8 billion in the first half of 2009 represent a 5 percent decrease over first half 2008 net earned premiums of $3.9 billion, declining across all Assurant businesses.
Net investment income in the first half of 2009 decreased 11 percent to $353.4 million, from $399.0 million in the first half of 2008, primarily due to a decrease in average invested assets and lower investment yields.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2009 net operating income was $27.9 million, a 14 percent decrease from second quarter 2008 net operating income of $32.4 million. Net operating income for the six months of 2009 was $58.2 million, down 27 percent from $79.9 million for the first six months of 2008. For both the quarter and six months, the decline was primarily the result of unfavorable credit insurance loss experience in the United Kingdom, which increased the combined ratio, as well as lower net investment income. The domestic combined ratio continued to improve sequentially and on a quarterly basis. Results for the second quarter 2009 include a $2.4 million restructuring charge, and results for the six months of 2008 include $6.9 million of losses from Brazilian operations and $11.7 million of income from a client related settlement.
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $666.9 million, from $700.6 million in the second quarter 2008. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2009 decreased 5 percent to $1.3 billion. The decrease for the quarter and the six months was primarily driven by the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 97 ("FASB 97") for pre-need insurance contracts sold in 2009 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Absent the application of FASB 97 and the impact of foreign exchange, net earned premiums would have increased $36.0 million, or 5.1 percent, for the second quarter of 2009.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2009 net operating income was $91.2 million, a 30 percent decrease from second quarter 2008 net operating income of $131.0 million. Net operating income for the first six months of 2009 was $195.9 million, down 23 percent from $255.8 million for the first six months of 2008. Net operating income for the quarter and six months was affected primarily by three factors which reduced revenue: loans lost in servicer consolidation; fewer policies on real estate owned ("REO") properties; and higher catastrophe reinsurance costs. Second quarter 2009 also included a $2.5 million restructuring charge. The loss ratio for the second quarter 2009 increased due to higher than normal frequency of smaller-scale weather events. The impact of Insurance Services Office ("ISO") catastrophic losses for 2009 was consistent with the $11.5 million losses reported in second quarter 2008. In addition, the first six months of 2008 had a favorable $4.6 million client-related settlement.
Assurant Specialty Property second quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 11 percent, to $477.8 million, from $533.9 million in the second quarter 2008. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2009 decreased 4 percent to $971.6 million. Net earned premium for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 declined due to the three factors noted above.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health net operating loss for second quarter 2009 was $10.3 million, compared to second quarter 2008 net operating income of $27.7 million. Net operating income for the first six months of 2009 was $4.3 million, down 93 percent from $65.0 million in 2008. For both the quarter and six months, loss experience was significantly higher than a year ago. The decline for the quarter is primarily a result of deteriorating claims experience caused by higher utilization, and $9.0 million after-tax reserve strengthening to address the unfavorable claim reserve development in the last two quarters.
Assurant Health second quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 4 percent to $468.9 million, from $487.7 million in the second quarter 2008. Net earned premiums for the first six months of 2009 decreased 4 percent to $941.2 million. Individual medical premiums for both the quarter and six months decreased less than 1 percent, while small group medical premiums declined 13 percent for the quarter and 14 percent for the six-month period.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2009 net operating income was $12.1 million, a 35 percent decrease from second quarter 2008 net operating income of $18.6 million. Net operating income for the six month period was $19.2 million, down 45
 
percent from $35.0 million for the first six months of 2008. The decline for the quarter is primarily the result of lower investment income and higher general expenses including a $1.5 million restructuring charge in the quarter. The decline for the six month period is the result of less favorable loss experience and lower investment income.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 4 percent to $262.2 million, from $273.2 million in the second quarter 2008. Net earned premiums for the six-month period decreased 5 percent to $526.0 million, down from $553.7 million for the first half of 2008, which included a single premium of $5.5 million for a closed block of business. The decrease for both the quarter and first six months was across all product lines reflecting economic pressures in the small business sector.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2009 was $16.1 million, compared to a loss of $18.8 million in the second quarter 2008. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first six months of 2009 was $29.6 million, compared to a net operating loss of $24.7 million for the first six months of 2008. Improvements for the quarter were driven by a $3.0 million decrease in expenses associated with the ongoing SEC investigation. Six month results were negatively impacted by $4.6 million of previously reported compensation expenses and a $3.8 million decline in investment income, partially offset by a $4.6 million reduction in expenses associated with the SEC investigation.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") increased to $4.7 billion at June 30, 2009. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, increased 6 percent to $39.38 from $37.16 at December 31, 2008 and was up 5 percent versus March 31, 2009. AOCI improved by $359.3 million from December 31, 2008. Annualized average operating ROE
2
for the first six months of 2009 was 10.5 percent. As of June 30, 2009, total assets were $24.8 billion. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 17.3 percent from 18.3 percent at December 31, 2008. The ratio of total investments to stockholders' equity, including AOCI, was 2.9 to 1, as of June 30, 2009.
On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 115-2, "Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments" ("FSP 115-2"). The new accounting guidance revises the recognition and reporting requirements for OTTI on the Company's debt securities. Under FSP 115-2, the Company increased the amortized cost basis of these debt securities by $43.1 million after-tax and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment in its shareholders' equity section. The cumulative effect adjustment had no effect on total shareholders' equity as it increased retained earnings and reduced accumulated other comprehensive income.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was 19.2% and 18.0%, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was 13.6% and 18.1%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.

NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2009  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009.
Third Quarter Results
Net income in the third quarter 2009 was $144.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $111.4 million, or ($0.94) per diluted share, in the third quarter 2008. Quarterly results benefited from a $12.9 million after-tax realized gain in the investment portfolio versus a $194.5 million after-tax realized loss in the third quarter 2008. In addition, there were no reportable catastrophe losses compared to $94.8 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in the third quarter 2008.
Net operating income
1
for the third quarter 2009 was $126.2 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2008 net operating income of $83.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. The improvement reflects the absence of reportable catastrophe losses at Assurant Specialty Property and increased profitability at Assurant Solutions. Less favorable results at Assurant Employee Benefits and a loss at Assurant Health partially offset the increase.
"The third quarter 2009 was good on several fronts as we grew our capital position, increased book value per share and generated a consolidated annualized operating ROE
2
of 10.7 percent," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer.
"Assurant Specialty Property delivered excellent results while Assurant Solutions continued to show improved performance. Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits are managing through an especially challenging landscape. Both were affected by economic pressures on consumers and small businesses."
Net earned premiums in the third quarter 2009 were $1.9 billion, a 6 percent decrease from $2.0 billion in the same 2008 period, declining across all Assurant businesses driven primarily by the difficult economic environment.
Net investment income in the third quarter 2009 decreased 10 percent to $172.9 million compared to $192.3 million in the third quarter 2008 due to lower average invested assets and lower yields.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first nine months of 2009 was $418.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, an increase of 58 percent compared to $265.4 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008. The increase reflects $217.6 million of fewer after-tax realized losses in the investment portfolio, $83.5 million of after-tax income from a legal settlement, and no reportable catastrophe losses in 2009. Nine-month results in 2008 included $94.8 million of net after-tax reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 25 percent to $363.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, from $483.7 million, or $4.06 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008. The decrease was driven primarily by net operating losses at Assurant Health and lower operating earnings at Assurant Employee Benefits.
Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2009 were $5.6 billion, a 5 percent decrease from $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, declining across all Assurant businesses due primarily to the difficult economic conditions.
Net investment income for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 11 percent to $526.3 million, from $591.3 million in the first nine months of 2008, primarily due to decreases in average invested assets and investment yields.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's quarterly results by segment for the last seven quarters can be found in the Company's financial supplement on page 20.
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2009 net operating income was $31.6 million, a 55 percent increase from third quarter 2008 net operating income of $20.4 million. Results for the third quarter of 2008 included a charge of $7.7 million after-tax related to the acquisition of GE's Warranty Management Group. Results for the quarter improved as the domestic combined ratio benefited from favorable underwriting in the service contract business. Net operating income for the first nine months was $89.8 million, down 10 percent from $100.3 million in 2008. Lower investment income and an increase in the international combined ratio due to continued unfavorable credit insurance loss experience in the United Kingdom drove the decrease.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $669.3 million, versus $707.1 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $2.0 billion. Decreases for the quarter and nine months were primarily driven by the application of universal life insurance accounting to new preneed business sold in 2009 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Absent these two factors, net earned premiums for the third quarter of 2009 would have increased 4 percent and premiums for the first nine months of 2009 would have increased 5 percent.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2009 net operating income was $103.2 million, an increase from third quarter 2008 net operating income of $30.9 million. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2009 was $299.1 million, up 4 percent from $286.7 million in 2008. Improvements for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 were primarily the result of no reportable catastrophe losses. This compares to $94.8 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in the third quarter and nine months of 2008. The third quarter 2009 results benefited from a $5.9 million after-tax subrogation reimbursement related to the 2007 California wildfires.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 7 percent, to $478.7 million, as compared to $513.2 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $1.5 billion. Lower premium from real estate-owned policies, less premium from loans lost due to servicer consolidation and higher reinsurance costs caused the declines.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health reported a net operating loss for the third quarter 2009 of $4.8 million, compared to third quarter 2008 net operating income of $30.2 million. The net operating loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $0.5 million, compared to net operating income of $95.2 million in 2008. Declines for the quarter and nine months reflect high utilization of medical services. The third quarter 2009 results include a charge of $8.1 million after-tax for an unfavorable ruling in a lawsuit.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 3 percent to $470.4 million, compared to $486.7 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 4 percent to $1.4 billion. Individual medical premiums decreased less than 1 percent for the third quarter and the first nine months, while small group premiums decreased 11 percent for the quarter and 13 percent for the nine-month period. The premium decreases for the quarter and nine months were caused primarily by a continued high level of policy lapses.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2009 net operating income was $11.5 million, a 47 percent decrease from $21.5 million in third quarter 2008. Net operating income for the nine-month period was $30.6 million, down 46 percent from $56.4 million for the same period in 2008. Less favorable loss experience across all product lines and lower investment income resulted in the declines.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 8 percent versus 2008, to $256 million. The first nine months net earned premiums decreased 6 percent to $782 million. Nine-month results for 2008 included $5.5 million in single premiums from a closed block of business. Premium decreases for the quarter and first nine months of 2009, reflect economic pressures in the small business sector and previously disclosed client losses in the alternative distribution channel.
 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2009 was $9.8 million compared to a loss of $14.8 million in 2008. Third quarter 2008 results were negatively affected by a $4 million increase in tax liabilities. The net operating loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $39.3 million compared to a loss of $39.5 million in 2008.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") increased to $4.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2009. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, increased 9 percent to $40.57 from $37.16 at Dec. 31, 2008 and was up 3 percent from June 30, 2009. AOCI improved by $793.3 million from Dec. 31, 2008, of which $696.9 million was the result of improvements in the investment portfolio. In the third quarter of 2009, Assurant repurchased more than 1.1 million shares for $31.9 million. The annualized operating ROE
2
was 10.7 percent for the quarter and 10.6 percent for the first nine months of 2009. As of Sept. 30, 2009, total assets were $25.7 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 17.0 percent versus 18.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2008.
"In summary, results demonstrate that at our core, Assurant's business model is fundamentally strong and actions to improve performance are taking hold," said Pollock.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 12.5% and (11.2)%, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 13.0% and 9.0%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On December 18, 2009, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a three-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain lenders party thereto; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent; and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent. The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's prior five-year $500 million revolving credit facility, entered into on April 29, 2005 and previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 3, 2005. The prior revolving credit facility was scheduled to expire in April 2010, but terminated upon the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement, which expires in December 2012, provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and/or letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $350 million. The proceeds of these loans may be used for the Company's commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. The Company may increase the total amount available under the Credit Agreement to $525 million subject to certain conditions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. An event of default would cause the unpaid principal and accrued interest and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On January 21, 2010, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has entered into a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") that concludes the previously disclosed investigation by the SEC into a finite reinsurance arrangement entered into by the Company. A copy of the Company's news release regarding the settlement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: January 21, 2010
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that it has entered into a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that concludes the SEC's finite reinsurance investigation of Assurant.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21, 2010
The SEC made no allegation of fraud on Assurant's part. Rather, the SEC alleges that, in connection with its accounting for a recovery under a catastrophe reinsurance arrangement that expired in 2004, the Company violated certain non-fraud-related sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Assurant neither admits nor denies the SEC's allegations.
"We are pleased to have the matter resolved and we look forward to continuing to serve our clients and delivering value for all Assurant stakeholders," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer. "With this matter concluded, we expect to renew our share repurchase program after our full-year 2009 earnings announcement next month."
The SEC staff has informed the Company that it does not intend to pursue any charges or other action against any current executives of Assurant. The Company believes it also is unlikely that the SEC will pursue any charges or actions against former employees who received Wells notices in 2007.
Assurant agreed to the entry of a judgment requiring payment of a civil penalty of $3.5 million and enjoining the Company from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws. The charge will be reflected in the Company's fourth quarter 2009 financial results. The settlement is subject to court approval.
Assurant is a premier provider of specialized insurance products and related services in North America and select worldwide markets. Its four key businesses  Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits  partner with clients who are leaders in their industries and have built leadership positions in a number of specialty insurance market segments worldwide.
Assurant, a Fortune 500 company and a member of the S&P 500, is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AIZ. Assurant has over $25 billion in assets and $8 billion in annual revenue.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive have agreed to amend the Agreement to (i) eliminate the additional payment to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis for (a) any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax) upon the Payments, and (b) any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect to such income taxes) and any excise tax imposed on such additional payment and (ii) reduce the amounts payable under this Agreement by an amount sufficient to reduce the aggregate Parachute Value of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount if the aggregate after-tax amount that would be received by the Executive without applying such reduction would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that would be received by the Executive if such reduction were applied.
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:
Section 8 of the Agreement is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) any Payment (or any acceleration of any Payment) to or for the benefit of Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the reduction of the amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement to the Safe Harbor Amount would provide the Executive with a greater after-tax amount than if such amounts were not reduced, then the amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount sufficient to reduce the Parachute Value of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount. The reduction of the Parachute Value of the Payments, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections of this Agreement in the following order: (i) Section 5(a)(1)(B) hereof, (ii) Section 5(a)(1)(A)(v) hereof and (iii) Section 5(a)(2) hereof unless an alternative method of reduction was elected by Executive prior to the date set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement. If the reductions described in the preceding sentence are not sufficient to reduce the Parachute Value of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, further reduction of the Parachute Value of the Payments shall be made in the manner which has the least economic cost to the Executive.
(b) All determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including the Safe Harbor Amount, whether and when an Excise Tax is due, the amount of Excise Tax and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it shall furnish Executive with a written opinion to such effect, and to the effect that failure to report the Excise
Tax, if any, on Executive's applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. In the event the Accounting Firm determines that the Parachute Value of the Payments shall be reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount, it shall furnish Executive with a written opinion to such effect. The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive (except as provided in paragraph (c) below).
(c) If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") proceeding, which has been finally and conclusively resolved, that Payments have been made to, or provided for the benefit of, Executive by the Company, which are in excess of the limitations provided in this Section 8 (hereinafter referred to as an "Excess Payment"), such Excess Payment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a loan to Executive made on the date Executive received the Excess Payment and Executive shall repay the Excess Payment to the Company on demand, together with interest on the Excess Payment at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of Executive's receipt of such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the determination, it is possible that Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Section 8. In the event that it is determined (i) by the Accounting Firm, the Company (which shall include the position taken by the Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or the IRS or (ii) pursuant to a determination by a court, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount equal to such Underpayment to Executive within 10 days of such determination together with interest on such amount at the applicable federal rate from the date such amount would have been paid to Executive until the date of payment. Executive shall cooperate, to the extent his or her expenses are reimbursed by the Company, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the IRS in connection with the Excise Tax or the determination of the Excess Payment.
(d) . The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 8.
Definitions
(i) "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax.
(ii) "Parachute Value" of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
(iii) A "Payment" shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
(iv) The "Safe Harbor Amount" means 2.99 times the Executive's "base amount," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set the Executive's hand and, pursuant to the authorization from the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company has caused these presents to be executed in its name on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2009.
NEW YORK, Feb. 3, 2010 
"Although we are committed to doing better, we were able to produce operating ROE of 10.1 percent in 2009 in an especially challenging economy," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer. "While we see encouraging signs, we are not content to wait for a full recovery. We have initiated significant actions to create our own opportunities for growth and to increase profitability.
"We are pleased with the new business momentum we are building. The cost saving measures we have already implemented will yield benefits in 2010 and going forward. Our strengthened capital position improves our flexibility to build shareholder value for the long-term."
Fourth Quarter 2009 Results
Net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased to $101.6 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2008 net operating income of $153.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share. The primary reasons for the decline were restructuring charges of $12.3 million after-tax and a net operating loss at Assurant Health of $29.7 million that includes a litigation reserve increase of $24.0 million after-tax.
 
Net income for fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 93 percent to $11.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter of 2008 net income of $182.4 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, primarily driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $83.0 million (see discussion later in this release) and $29.7 million loss for Assurant Health. After-tax net realized losses on investments were $7.6 million in the quarter, compared to $33.7 million in the fourth quarter 2008. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 included a $62.4 million tax benefit related to the sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.9 billion, down 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008, with all businesses experiencing modest downturns in the current recessionary environment.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased to $172.5 million from $183.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Twelve-Month 2009 Results
Net operating income in 2009 was $464.9 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $637.4 million, or $5.36 per diluted share, in 2008. The decline was primarily due to a $30.2 million net operating loss for Assurant Health in 2009, as well as reduced earnings at Assurant Employee Benefits. Results also include $18.7 million of after-tax restructuring charges across all Assurant businesses.
Net income in 2009 was $430.6 million, or $3.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 4 percent compared to net income of $447.8 million, or $3.76 per diluted share in 2008. Net income in 2009 includes an $83.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a $30.2 million loss for Assurant Health and an $83.5 million after-tax benefit from a favorable legal settlement. After-tax net realized losses on investments were $34.8 million in 2009, compared to $278.6 million in 2008. Results in 2008 included an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums in 2009 were $7.6 billion, down from $7.9 billion in 2008. All businesses had moderate declines in net earned premiums.
Net investment income in 2009 decreased to $698.8 million from $774.3 million in 2008.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
 
 
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last eight quarters can be found on page 21 in the Company's Financial Supplement.
 
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income improved for the quarter and the year as a result of favorable domestic service contract loss experience. Domestic results included restructuring charges of $1.4 million after-tax in the fourth quarter 2009, and $3.8 million for the year. International results declined for the quarter and the year due to continued unfavorable loss experience in the United Kingdom. International results include European restructuring charges of $7.0 million after-tax for the quarter.
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Solutions' results for the last eight quarters can be found on page 21 of the Company's Financial Supplement.
Net earned premiums would have increased 1.1 percent for the quarter and 3.7 percent for the year, excluding the impact of a previously disclosed accounting change affecting preneed business sold in 2009, and the impact of foreign exchange.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income for the quarter declined due in part to higher reinsurance costs and higher non-catastrophe loss experience. No reportable catastrophe losses were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $5.1 million after-tax of such losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net operating income was level with 2008. The impact of slowing revenues, higher reinsurance costs and higher overall loss experience was offset by a substantial reduction in catastrophe losses versus 2008. No catastrophe losses were incurred during 2009 compared with $99.9 million after-tax of such losses and reinstatement premiums in 2008. Full-year 2009 results included $2.5 million after-tax of restructuring charges.
Net earned premiums for the quarter and the year were down primarily due to declines in real estate owned premiums and increased reinsurance costs. Increases in policy placement rates and average insured values partially offset these declines for the quarter and for the year.
Assurant Health
 
Results decreased significantly for fourth quarter due to the $24.0 million after-tax litigation reserve increase, $2.5 million after-tax expenses for H1N1-related medical services and $2.9 million of after-tax restructuring costs. In addition, during the year the business experienced substantial increases in the utilization and intensity of medical
 
services. Twelve-month 2009 results also include a charge of $8.1 million after-tax for an unfavorable ruling in a lawsuit disclosed in the third quarter.
Individual medical premiums decreased less than 1 percent for the fourth quarter and the year, while small group premiums decreased 8 percent for the quarter and 12 percent for the year driven primarily by a continued high level of policy lapses.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the quarter decreased due to lower premiums and lower net investment income. Full-year results declined due to less favorable underwriting experience and lower net investment income. Restructuring charges totaled $1.0 million after-tax in the fourth quarter and $2.5 million after-tax for the year. Reserve changes resulting from the Company's annual reserve adequacy studies improved earnings $2.1 million after-tax in the quarter and for 2009, compared to $3.5 million after-tax in the fourth quarter and full-year 2008.
Premium declines for both the quarter and the twelve months occurred across all product lines driven by economic pressures in the small business sector as well as the previously disclosed loss of assumed client reinsurance premiums. The addition of two new reinsurance clients and the acquisition of a block of business in the fourth quarter 2009 partially offset the overall decrease. 2008 results included $5.9 million and $11.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively in single premiums from closed blocks of business.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating losses improved as a result of a $4.5 million tax benefit from the change in certain tax liabilities in the fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was partially offset by a $3.5 million after-tax civil penalty related to the settlement and conclusion of the SEC investigation regarding finite reinsurance. Full-year results also reflect $4.6 million after-tax of previously disclosed compensation expenses.
Goodwill Impairment
Following the completion of its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $83.0 million to net income, or ($0.70) per diluted share, for the quarter. The impairment relates to goodwill that arose from a 2001 acquisition in Assurant Employee Benefits. The charge does not impact cash flow from operations or change the Company's outlook for the business.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), increased to $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, increased 9 percent in 2009 to $40.47, from $37.16 at Dec. 31, 2008. AOCI improved $736.9 million from Dec. 31, 2008, primarily from improved market values in the investment portfolio. Annualized operating ROE was 8.5 percent for the quarter and 10.1 percent for the
 
year. As of Dec. 31, 2009, total assets were $25.8 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 17.0 percent versus 18.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2008.
Share Repurchase Program
On Jan. 21, 2010, Assurant announced a settlement of the SEC's finite reinsurance investigation. With this matter concluded, Assurant expects to resume its share repurchase program after the earnings blackout period ends on Feb. 8, 2010. On Jan. 22, 2010, Assurant's board of directors authorized an additional $600 million for the repurchase of Assurant's shares. This brings the Company's total repurchase authorization to $770 million for use in the open market and/or for private transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors.

Some of the statements included in this press release and its exhibits, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they may use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast," or the negative versions of those words and terms with a similar meaning. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this earnings release or the exhibits as a result of new information or future events or developments.
The following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those currently estimated by management: (i) failure to maintain significant client relationships, distribution sources and contractual arrangements; (ii) failure to attract and retain sales representatives; (iii) deterioration in the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value that could impair the Company's goodwill; (iv) negative impact on our business and negative publicity due to unfavorable outcomes in litigation and/or regulatory investigations; (v) current or new laws and regulations, including proposed legislation relating to health care reform, that could increase our costs and/or decrease our revenues; (vi) general global economic, financial market and political conditions (including difficult conditions in financial, capital and credit markets, the global economic slowdown, fluctuations in interest rates, mortgage rates, monetary policies, unemployment and inflationary pressure); (vii) inadequacy of reserves established for future claims losses; (viii) failure to predict or manage benefits, claims and other costs; (ix) losses due to natural and man-made catastrophes; (x) increases or decreases in tax valuation allowances; (xi) fluctuations in exchange rates and other risks related to our international operations; (xii) unavailability, inadequacy and unaffordable pricing of reinsurance coverage; (xiii) diminished value of invested assets in our investment portfolio (due to, among other things, the recent volatility in financial markets, the global economic slowdown, credit and liquidity risk, other than temporary impairments and inability to target an appropriate overall risk level); (xiv) inability of reinsurers to meet their obligations; (xv) insolvency of third parties to whom we have sold or may sell businesses through reinsurance or modified co-insurance; (xvi) credit risk of some of our agents in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions; (xvii) a further decline in the manufactured housing industry; (xviii) a decline in our credit or financial strength ratings (including the risk of ratings downgrades in the insurance industry); (xix) failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems; (xx) failure to protect client information and privacy; (xxi) failure to find and integrate suitable acquisitions and new insurance ventures; (xxii) inability of our subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends; (xxiii) failure to provide for succession of senior management and key executives; and (xxiv) significant competitive pressures in our businesses and cyclicality of the insurance industry.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
 
 
 
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $41.03 as of December 31, 2009, as shown in the reconciliation below.
Please see page 21 of the Financial Supplement, which is available on our website at www.assurant.com, for a summary of net operating income disclosed items.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 1.0% and 19.6%, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 10.1% and 11.5%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $41.03 as of December 31, 2009, as shown in the reconciliation below.

(e) On March 11, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for performance-based awards (the "PSU Agreement") for use in granting awards under the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "ALTEIP").
The PSU Agreement provides for the award of performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") that vest, subject to the employee's continued employment through the third anniversary of the grant date, on the date that the Committee determines and certifies the Company's performance with respect to pre-established goals. The payout amount will be based upon the average of the Company's ranked average percentile relative to an index of the Company's peers, for each calendar year included in a three-year performance period, with respect to the following goals: growth in book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income
1
; growth in revenue and achievement of total shareholder return. Each goal is weighted equally in determining the Company's annual ranked average percentile index performance. The percentage of PSUs that vests ranges from 0% for performance below the 25th percentile of the selected index to 150% for performance at or above the 75th percentile of the selected index, with vesting for performance that falls between the 25th and 75th percentiles to be determined by straight-line interpolation. PSUs are settled in shares of the Company's common stock no later than 75 calendar days after the end of the performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid in cash at the time of settlement with respect to the shares earned by the participant. PSUs do not carry voting rights.
In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the ALTEIP) during the performance period (i) prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, a number of PSUs will vest assuming a level of performance equal to the 50th percentile of the selected index or (ii) after the first anniversary of the grant date, a number of PSUs will vest assuming a level of performance equal to the greater of (A) the 50th percentile of the selected index and (B) the actual percentile of the selected index achieved, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the date of the Change of Control as to which performance can be determined.
Upon a termination of employment (i) due to retirement, all PSUs other than those granted in the year of retirement will vest; or (ii) by the Company without cause or due to death or disability, vesting will be determined on a pro rata basis; subject, in each case, to the level of performance achieved for the performance period. Upon termination of employment for any other reason, all PSUs will be forfeited without payment.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the PSU Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and the ALTEIP, included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form S-8 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2008.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of , between Assurant, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Participant").
[]
                    
[
                    
]
In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein and the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. . (a) . Subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement (this "Agreement") and the provisions of the Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of (the "Grant Date"), Restricted Stock Units (the "Restricted Stock Units"), each with respect to one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per Share ("Common Stock"). All capitalized terms used herein, to the extent not defined, shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Grant, Vesting and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units
Grant
[]
                    
[]
            
(b) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a number of Restricted Stock Units shall vest and shall no longer be subject to any restriction on the date that the Committee determines and certifies (the "Determination Date") the Company's achievement in respect of each Goal (as defined below) for the period beginning on January 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2012 (such period, the "Performance Period"), that the Participant is continuously employed by the Company until the third anniversary of the Grant Date. Vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based upon the average of the Company's ranked average percentile, for each calendar year included in the Performance Period, with respect to each of the following goals (the "Goals") relative to an index of the Company's peers established by the Company within 90 days following the commencement of the Performance Period (the "Ranked Average Percentile Index Performance"): growth in book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, growth in revenue, and achievement of total shareholder return. Each Goal shall be weighted equally in determining the Company's annual ranked average percentile index performance. The number of Restricted Stock Units that shall vest shall be determined as follows:
Vesting
provided
 
Vesting for ranked average percentile index performance that falls between the 25th and 50th percentiles and between the 50th and 75th percentiles shall be determined by straight-line interpolation. The Determination Date shall occur no later than 70 calendar days following the conclusion of the Performance Period, and on the Determination Date the Committee shall determine the number of Restricted Stock Units, if any, that shall vest pursuant to each Goal. Such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons for all purposes.
 
(c) . Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason during the Performance Period, all Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that the Participant experiences a Termination of Employment during the Performance Period due to the Participant's Retirement at any time following the end of the calendar year in which the Grant Date occurred, the Participant shall vest in that number of Restricted Stock Units determined in accordance with Section 1(b) and (ii) in the event of the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Performance Period by the Company without Cause, or Termination of Employment due to death or Disability, the Participant shall vest in a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the product of (A) the number of Restricted Stock Units determined in accordance with Section 1(b) and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the Performance Period from the Grant Date until the date of Termination of Employment ( that, for this purpose, the month in which the Grant Date occurs shall be considered a full month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Performance Period. Any Restricted Stock Units earned pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be settled in accordance with Section 2. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with the Company's Affiliates and its successors. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any such Affiliates to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.
Forfeiture; Termination of Employment
provided
2. . As soon as practicable after the Determination Date, and in no event later than 75 calendar days after the end of the Performance Period, the Company shall deliver to the Participant or his or her personal representative, in book-position or certificate form, one Share that does not bear any restrictive legend for each vested Restricted Stock Unit.
Settlement of Units
3. . The Participant shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents represent the right to receive an amount equal to the aggregate regular cash dividends that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled, of a number of Shares equal to the applicable number of Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, in cash, on the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled pursuant to this Agreement, based on the amount of dividends that would have accrued on the Shares earned based on actual performance.
Dividend Equivalents
4. . During the Performance Period and until such time as the Restricted Stock Units are ultimately settled as provided in Section 2 above, the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares covered by the Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable by the Participant by means of sale, assignment, exchange, encumbrance, pledge, hedge or otherwise. Any purported or attempted transfer of such Shares or such rights shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of the Restricted Stock Units
5. . During the Performance Period, the Participant shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting rights).
Rights as a Stockholder
6. . In the event of certain transactions during the Performance Period, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4 of the Plan or any applicable successor provision under the Plan. In the event of a Change of Control during the Performance Period (i) prior to the first anniversary of the Grant Date, the Participant shall vest in that number of Restricted Stock Units determined pursuant to Section 1(b), assuming that the Company
Adjustment; Change of Control
 
achieved Ranked Average Percentile Index Performance equal to the 50th percentile or (ii) after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, the Participant shall vest in that number of Restricted Stock Units determined pursuant to Section 1(b), assuming that the Company achieved Ranked Average Percentile Index Performance equal to the greater of (A) the 50th percentile and (B) the Company's actual Ranked Average Percentile Index Performance, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the date of the Change of Control as to which performance can, as a practical matter, be determined (but not later than the end of the Performance Period). Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Section 6 shall be settled within 5 calendar days following the Change of Control; , that any Restricted Stock Units that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code shall not be settled upon such Change of Control unless the Change of Control constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and will instead be settled at such time as specified in Section 2.
provided, however
7. . The Company agrees to pay any and all original issue taxes and stock transfer taxes that may be imposed on the issuance of Shares received by a Participant in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, together with any and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.
Payment of Transfer Taxes, Fees and Other Expenses
8. . No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for federal, state, local, foreign income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Restricted Stock Units, the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, all federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws and regulations to be withheld with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 8, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant, including deducting such amount from the delivery of Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that gives rise to the withholding requirement.
Taxes and Withholding
9. . Notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by facsimile, overnight courier, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
Notices
If to the Participant:
At the most recent address
on file at the Company.
If to the Company:
Assurant, Inc.
One Chase Manhattan Plaza, 41st Floor
New York, New York 10005
Attention: Secretary
or to such other address or facsimile number as any party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance with this Section 9. Notices and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant consents to electronic delivery of documents required to be delivered by the Company under the securities laws.
10. . This Agreement is personal to the Participant and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant's legal representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
Effect of Agreement
 
11. . The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws, as applied to contracts executed in and performed wholly within the State of Delaware. In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
Laws Applicable to Construction; Consent to Jurisdiction
12. . If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included.
Severability
13. . In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Committee has the power, among others, to (a) interpret the Plan, (b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and (c) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Participant and the Company each acknowledges that this Agreement (together with the Plan) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Conflicts and Interpretation
14. . The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall materially impair the rights of the Participant without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.
Amendment
15. . It is the intention of the Company that the Restricted Stock Units shall either (a) not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or (b) comply in all respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, such that no delivery of Shares pursuant to this Agreement will result in the imposition of taxation or penalties as a consequence of the application of Section 409A of the Code. Shares in respect of any Restricted Stock Units that (i) constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) vest as a consequence of the Participant's termination of employment shall not be delivered until the date that the Participant incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (or, if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the date that is six months following the date of such "separation from service"). If the Company determines after the Grant Date that an amendment to this Agreement is necessary to ensure the foregoing, it may, notwithstanding Section 14, make such an amendment, effective as of the Grant Date or any later date, without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Plan, in the event that any taxes or penalties are imposed on the Participant by reason of Section 409A of the Code, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that such taxes or penalties shall be the exclusive obligation of the Participant, and the Company shall have no liability therefor.
Section 409A of the Code
 
16. . The headings of Sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Headings
17. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which together shall constitute one and the same original.
Counterparts
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, as of the date first above written, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by a duly authorized officer and the Participant has hereunto set the Participant's hand.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the first quarter 2010.
NEW YORK, April 28, 2010 
"First quarter results reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer. "We are encouraged by the progress made to increase revenues, manage expenses and increase profitability. We are mindful that continued high unemployment will temper economic recovery, and healthcare reform will bring about changes in how some of our businesses operate. Our efforts remain focused on creating our own growth opportunities and increasing shareholder value."
First Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income for the first quarter 2010 increased 12 percent to $154.3 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 net operating income of $137.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. The primary reasons for the increase were the operating results at Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Employee Benefits.
Net income for the first quarter 2010 increased 95 percent to $157.2 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 net income of $80.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $2.9 million in the quarter, compared to after-tax net realized losses of $36.2 million in first quarter 2009. Net income in the first quarter 2009 also included $21.0 million of tax expense caused by a change in deferred tax assets.
Net earned premiums in the first quarter 2010 were $1.9 billion, up slightly from the first quarter 2009, primarily attributable to growth in Assurant Employee Benefits.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant for first quarter 2010 and first quarter 2009:
 
 
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last five quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
 
Assurant Solutions
 
 
Net operating income decreased versus 2009 due to $2.8 million of tax expense resulting from European business restructuring and a $4.0 million after-tax change in the value of consumer price index caps, instruments that protect against inflation risk in our preneed product. Net operating income benefited from favorable domestic service contract loss experience and favorable results for preneed. The international combined ratio was up modestly for the quarter due to continued poor loss experience in the United Kingdom. However, it improved sequentially due to risk management and restructuring initiatives implemented in 2009.
Net earned premiums were level with the first quarter 2009. International net earned premiums increased by 26 percent due to growth from both new and existing clients as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Domestic net earned premiums declined by 6 percent due to lower service contract sales in 2009 and the continued loss of premiums from former clients that are no longer in business.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
 
Net operating income increased versus 2009 due to improved loss and expense ratios. Results included a $7.6 million after-tax favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review. The loss ratio benefited from favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. There were no reportable catastrophes during the first quarter 2010 or 2009.
Net earned premiums for the quarter increased, primarily due to a $13.6 million adjustment from the unearned premium reserve review.
Assurant Health
 
 
Net operating income decreased versus 2009 due to the higher medical utilization trends experienced over the past year. Loss ratios improved sequentially due to pricing and plan design changes initiated in 2009.
 
Net earned premiums declined slightly with individual medical premiums increasing about $1 million compared to the first quarter 2009 while small group premiums declined $5 million.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
 
Net operating income for the quarter increased significantly versus 2009 due to favorable loss experience. Unusually low disability incidence levels and favorable life insurance results contributed to the improvement.
Net earned premiums increased due to the addition of two new reinsurance clients and the acquisition of a block of business announced in the third quarter 2009.
Corporate & Other

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 was 12.8% and 8.7%, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 10.1% and 11.5%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding AOCI as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $43.16 as of March 31, 2010, as shown in the reconciliation below.

9.4. Section 409A of the Code.
SECTION 10. Qualified Performance-Based Awards; Section 16(b); Section 409A.
The provisions of this Plan are intended to ensure that all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted hereunder to any Participant who is or may be a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code) in the tax year in which such Option or Stock Appreciation Right is expected to be deductible to the Company qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, and all such Awards shall therefore be considered Qualified Performance-Based Awards and this Plan shall be interpreted and operated consistent with that intention. When granting any Award other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee may designate such Award as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, based upon a determination that (a) the recipient is or may be a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code) with respect to such Award, and (b) the Committee wishes such Award to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, and the terms of any such Award (and of the grant thereof) shall be consistent with such designation. Within 90 days after the commencement of a Performance Period or, if earlier, by the expiration of 25% of a Performance Period, the Committee will designate one or more Performance Periods, determine the Participants for the Performance Periods, and establish the Performance Goals for the Performance Periods.
10.1. Qualified Performance-Based Awards.
Each Qualified Performance-Based Award (other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right) shall be earned, vested, and/or payable (as applicable) upon the achievement of one or more Performance Goals, together with the satisfaction of any other conditions, such as continued employment, as the Committee may determine to be appropriate. Moreover, no Qualified Performance-Based Award may be amended, nor may the Committee exercise any discretionary authority it may otherwise have under this Plan with respect to a Qualified Performance-Based Award under this Plan, in any manner that would cause the Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the
10.2. Performance Goals and Other Conditions.
 
Section 162(m) Exemption; , however, that (i) the Committee may provide, either in connection with the grant of the applicable Award or by amendment thereafter, that achievement of such Performance Goals will be waived upon the death or Disability of the Participant (or under any other circumstance with respect to which the existence of such possible waiver will not cause the Award to fail to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption), and (ii) the provisions of Section 9 shall apply notwithstanding this Section 10.2.
provided
Neither the full Board nor the Administrator shall be permitted to exercise authority granted to the Committee to the extent that the grant or exercise of such authority to or by the Board or the Administrator would cause an Award designated as a Qualified Performance-Based Award not to qualify for, or to cease to qualify for, the Section 162(m) Exemption.
10.3. Limits on Board and Administrator Authority.
The provisions of this Plan are intended to ensure that no transaction under the Plan is subject to (and not exempt from) the short-swing recovery rules of Section 16(b) of the Act (""). Accordingly, the composition of the Committee shall be subject to such limitations as the Board deems appropriate to permit transactions pursuant to this Plan to be exempt (pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Act) from Section 16(b), and no delegation of authority by the Committee shall be permitted if such delegation would cause any such transaction to be subject to (and not exempt from) Section 16(b).
10.4. Section 16(b).
Section 16(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if for any reason the appointed Committee does not meet the requirements of Rule 16b-3 or Section 162(m) of the Code, such noncompliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m) of the Code shall not affect the validity of Awards, grants, interpretations of the Plan, or other actions of the Committee.
10.5. Awards Valid Notwithstanding Committee Composition.
It is the intention of the Company that no Award shall be "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically determines otherwise as provided in the immediately following sentence, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted accordingly. The terms and conditions governing any Awards that the Committee determines will be subject to Section 409A of the Code, including any rules for elective or mandatory deferral of the delivery of cash or Shares pursuant thereto and any rules regarding treatment of such Awards in the event of a Change of Control, shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, and shall comply in all respects with Section 409A of the Code.
10.6. Section 409A of the Code.
SECTION 11. Term, Amendment, and Termination.

In addition, no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company's stockholders (a) to the extent that such approval is required (i) by applicable law or by the listing standards of the Applicable Exchange as in effect as of the Effective Date or (ii) by applicable law or under the listing standards of the Applicable Exchange as may be required after the Effective Date, (b) to the extent that such amendment would materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (c) to the extent that such amendment would materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under the Plan, (d) to the extent that such amendment would materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan, or (e) to the extent that such amendment would accelerate the vesting of any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units under the Plan except as otherwise provided in the Plan.
11.3. Amendment of Plan.
Subject to Section 5.5, the Committee may unilaterally amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, but no such amendment shall cause a Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, nor shall any such amendment, without the Participant's consent, materially impair the rights of any Participant with respect to an Award, except such an amendment made to cause the Plan or Award to comply with applicable law, stock exchange rules, or accounting rules.
11.4. Amendment of Awards.
SECTION 12. Unfunded Status of Plan.
It is presently intended that the Plan will constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.

13.2. Additional Compensation Arrangements.
The Plan shall not constitute a contract of employment, and adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.
13.3. No Contract of Employment.
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of a Participant for federal, state, local, or foreign income or employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, such Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount.

If no beneficiary designation is in effect for a Participant at the time or his or her death, any such amounts shall be paid to, and any such rights may be exercised by, the estate of the Participant.
13.7. Designation of Death Beneficiary.
In the case of a grant of an Award to any employee of a Subsidiary of the Company, the Company may, if the Committee so directs, issue or transfer the Shares, if any, covered by the Award to the Subsidiary, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may specify, upon the condition or understanding that the Subsidiary will transfer the Shares to the employee in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. All Shares underlying Awards that are forfeited or canceled shall revert to the Company.

13.11. Foreign Employees and Foreign Law Considerations.
No Participant or Eligible Individual shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan. The Company, its Affiliates, or the Committee shall not be obligated to treat Participants or Eligible Individuals uniformly, and determinations made under the Plan may be made by the Committee selectively among Participants and/or Eligible Individuals, whether or not such Participants and Eligible Individuals are similarly situated.
13.12. No Rights to Awards; Non-Uniform Determinations.
To the extent allowable under applicable law, each member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which such member may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act under the Plan and against and from

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the second quarter and first six months of 2010.
NEW YORK, July 28, 2010 
"We are pleased with improved operating results for both the second quarter and first half of 2010," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer. "Our disciplined decision making allows us to add new clients, retain existing clients and manage expenses across all of our businesses. We are well-positioned for the long-term despite the challenges created by a slow economic recovery and the continued uncertainty surrounding health care reform."
Second Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income
1
for the second quarter 2010 increased 53 percent to $152.2 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 net operating income of $99.3 million, or $.84 per diluted share. Assurant Specialty Property again delivered strong results. Assurant Health operating results improved and included $17.4 million after-tax from a reserve decrease due to a legal settlement. Second quarter 2010 results included a $7.3 million after-tax restructuring charge for workforce reductions at Assurant Employee Benefits and Corporate.
Net income for the second quarter 2010 decreased 15 percent to $164.7 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 net income of $193.3 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. Net income in the second quarter 2009 included $85.0 million after-tax from a favorable legal settlement.
After-tax net realized gains on investments were $12.5 million in the quarter, compared to losses of $4.0 million in second quarter 2009.
Net earned premiums in the second quarter 2010 were $1.8 billion, down slightly from second quarter 2009 primarily due to a decline in premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Six-Month Results
Net operating income for the first half of 2010 increased 29 percent to $306.5 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared to $237.1 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, in 2009. Results in each operating business produced year-over-year improvement. Six-month earnings reflected strong results, particularly at Assurant Specialty Property. Results include a reserve decrease due to a legal settlement at Assurant Health.
Net income for the first six months of 2010 increased 18 percent to $321.9 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, versus $273.9 million, or $2.31 per diluted share in 2009. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $15.4 million for the first six months of 2010, compared to losses of $40.2 million in the first half of 2009. Net income for 2009 also included an $85.0 million benefit from a favorable legal settlement.
Net earned premiums in the first half of 2010 were $3.8 billion, up slightly from the first half of 2009 primarily due to growth at Assurant Employee Benefits.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last five quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income was up for the quarter and six months despite higher tax rates in both periods. It was level for the quarter and down slightly for the six months versus 2009 after adjusting for a $2.4 million after-tax restructuring charge in the second quarter of 2009. In the quarter, the domestic combined ratio increased slightly while the international combined ratio declined in the quarter primarily due to improved loss experience in the United Kingdom. Results for the six months reflect better domestic and international loss experience as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Net earned premiums decreased for the quarter and six months. The primary reasons are a decline in domestic net earned premiums caused by lower service contract sales in 2009 from former clients that are no longer in business, the decline in preneed premiums and the continued run-off of domestic credit. International net earned premiums grew for both the quarter and the six months due to the addition of new clients and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income increased for both the quarter and six months, reflecting improvements in both loss and expense ratios. Results for second quarter 2010 included $5.0 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses. There were no reportable catastrophes during 2009. Second quarter 2009 results also included a $2.5 million after-tax restructuring charge.
Net earned premiums were level for the quarter and up slightly for the six months as the first quarter 2010 results included a $13.6 million favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review. Growth in creditor-placed homeowners, creditor-placed flood and renters insurance for the quarter and six months was offset by increased ceded creditor-placed homeowners' premiums and lower real estate owned premiums.
Assurant Health
 
Net operating income for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 reflected improved loss ratios due to pricing and plan design changes initiated in 2009, and a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from a reserve decrease due to a legal settlement. Second quarter 2009 results included a $9.0 million after-tax reserve strengthening.
Net earned premiums for the second quarter and six months declined due to reduced small group and short-term medical premiums while individual medical premiums increased slightly.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 increased due to improved loss experience. Very favorable disability incidence and life mortality contributed to the increase. Second quarter results include a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge in 2010 and a $1.5 million restructuring charge in 2009.
Net earned premiums increased for the second quarter and six months of 2010 due to the acquisition of a block of business and reinsurance clients added in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the second quarter and six months improved mainly due to reduced tax expenses. The second quarter of 2010 included a $2.9 million after-tax restructuring charge while the six months of 2009 includes a $4.6 million after-tax compensation expense in the second quarter 2009.
Capital Position
The Company repurchased 6.1 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $215.1 million in the second quarter 2010. From quarter end through July 23, the Company repurchased an additional 910,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $32.7 million. Year-to-date repurchases through July 23 total 10.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $357.0 million, leaving $413.0 million remaining in the Company's repurchase authorization. The Company raised its dividend from $0.15 to $0.16 per common share during the quarter. As of June 30, 2010, corporate capital totaled approximately $575 million, up from $477 million at March 31, 2010.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), decreased slightly to $4.8 billion at June 30, 2010. The book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 7 percent to $43.42, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI improved by $212 million from Dec. 31, 2009. The annualized operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
was 12.7 percent for the quarter. As of June 30, 2010, total assets were $26.1 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, increased slightly to 17.1 percent at June 30, 2010 versus 17.0 percent at Dec. 31, 2009.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 was 13.2% and 19.2%, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 was 13.0% and 13.6%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding AOCI as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $45.95 as of June 30, 2010, as shown in the reconciliation below.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
[  ]   Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [  ]   Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
Item 2.05.    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On August 19, 2010, Assurant Health, a segment of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company"), internally announced reductions in workforce at various locations, including the Milwaukee headquarters of Assurant Health. The reductions are expected to be completed by mid-January 2011.
These reductions are part of Assurant Health's efforts to reduce operating costs and to streamline its organizational structure in order to prepare for significant changes in the post-reform health insurance marketplace.
The Company estimates that severance and outplacement costs related to the reductions in force will result in after-tax charges to Assurant Health's net operating income of approximately $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2010 and approximately $1.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
The Company expects substantially all of these charges to result in future cash expenditures in the approximate amounts of the estimated charges, described above.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT -- Some of the statements included i n this Form 8-K, particularly projections as to the timing of the anticipated workforce reductions, severance and outplacement costs and the timing and amount of the charges are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's best estimates, assumptions and projections and are subject to significant uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, which include, without limitation, the Company's ability to implement the workforce reductions as currently planned, the impact of external conditions, and unanticipated charges not currently contemplated that may occur as a result of the reductions. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K as a result of new information or future events or developments. For a detailed discussion of the gener al risk factors that could affect Company results, please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's periodic reports, including but not limited to, its 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Second Quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2010 
"Assurant's disciplined actions to grow revenues, manage expenses and become more efficient are yielding improved results," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and CEO. "Our businesses are generating strong cash flows and our corporate capital position is continuing to grow. We are well-positioned to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders."
Third Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income
1
for the third quarter 2010 increased 9.1 percent to $137.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 net operating income of $126.2 million, or $1.07 per diluted share. All four businesses  Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits  delivered improved results.
Net income for the third quarter 2010 decreased 2.1 percent to $141.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 net income of $144.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $4.0 million in the quarter, compared to after-tax net realized gains of $12.9 million in third quarter 2009.
Net earned premiums in the third quarter 2010 decreased 2.2 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion in third quarter 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the third quarter 2010 increased 1.9 percent to $176.2 million, compared to $172.9 million in third quarter 2009, as an increase in invested assets offset the impact of lower investment yields.
 
Nine-Month Results
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2010 increased 22.3 percent to $444.3 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, compared to $363.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2009. Results in each business produced year-over-year improvement.
Net income for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10.7 percent to $463.6 million, or $4.11 per diluted share, versus $418.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share year-to-date 2009. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $19.3 million for the first nine months of 2010, compared to net realized losses of $27.3 million for the same period of 2009. Results for the first nine months of 2010 also include a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from a reserve decrease due to a legal settlement. Net income for the first nine months of 2009 included an $83.5 million benefit from a favorable legal settlement and an $8.1 million after-tax legal charge.
Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2010 were $5.6 billion, down slightly compared with nine-month 2009 results.
Net investment income for the first nine months of 2010 was $525.4 million, down slightly compared to the first nine months of 2009. Lower investment yields offset the impact of an increase in invested assets.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last seven quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
 
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income was up for the quarter and first nine months of 2010. The international combined ratio declined for the quarter and year to date, reflecting continued improved loss experience. Results also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Effective tax rates continue to run higher than in 2009, but decreased from second quarter 2010. The domestic combined ratio increased in the third quarter 2010 due to less favorable loss experience in extended service contracts.
Net earned premiums decreased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010, primarily due to the discontinuation of domestic service contract sales in 2009 from former clients that are no longer in business and continued run-off of domestic credit business. Partially offsetting the decline, international net earned premiums increased for the quarter and first nine months due to new and existing client growth as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Preneed fee income increased, reflecting increased sales primarily in Canada.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income increased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010 reflecting an improved combined ratio. Third quarter 2010 results include no reportable catastrophes. Results for the first nine months of 2010 include a $7.6 million after-tax favorable unearned premium reserve adjustment and $5.0 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses compared to no reportable catastrophes during 2009. Third quarter 2009 results included a $5.9 million favorable after-tax subrogation reimbursement.
Net earned premiums increased slightly for the quarter and first nine months of 2010. The growth in creditor-placed homeowners and other premiums, including creditor-placed flood and renters, was offset by increased ceded premiums and lower real estate-owned premiums. Year-to-date 2010 results include a $13.6 million favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
 
Assurant Health
 
NM = Not Meaningful
Net operating income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased due to improved loss ratios, reflecting pricing and plan design changes implemented to address higher medical utilization trends. Third quarter 2010 results include a $5.0 million after-tax restructuring charge. Third quarter 2009 results included an $8.1 million after-tax legal charge. Results for the first nine months of 2010 benefited from a $17.4 million after-tax reserve decrease due to a legal settlement.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 due to a decline in small group and short-term medical premiums. Individual medical premiums increased slightly for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased due to favorable loss experience. Results for the quarter and nine months benefited from very low disability incidence and favorable life mortality rates. Yearto-date results include a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge compared to a $1.5 million restructuring charge in 2009.
Net earned premiums increased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010, reflecting both the acquisition of a block of business and reinsurance clients added in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased primarily due to increases in tax, compensation and pension-related costs.
Capital Position
The Company repurchased 1.2 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $44.9 million in the third quarter 2010. Year to date, through Sept. 30, 2010, the company repurchased 10.7 million shares for $369.2 million, with $400.9 million remaining in the repurchase authorization. During the third quarter 2010, corporate capital increased to approximately $710 million from about $575 million at June 30, 2010.
 
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), increased to $4.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, from $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009. The book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 10.4 percent to $44.67, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI of $514.7 million improved by $449 million from Dec. 31, 2009. The annualized operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
was 11.5 percent for the quarter. As of Sept. 30, 2010, total assets were approximately $27 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 16.8 percent at Sept. 30, 2010, versus 17 percent at Dec. 31, 2009, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.6 to 1.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was 10.9% and 12.5%, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was 12.1% and 13.0%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding AOCI as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $49.41 as of September 30, 2010, as shown in the reconciliation below.

NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2010
"Elaine Rosen's 25-year insurance industry career and seasoned understanding of Assurant's specialty strategy combine to make her an outstanding choice to lead our board of directors," said Robert B.

Item 2.06.    Material Impairments
 
On December 2, 2010, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that it will take a charge of approximately $31.3 million after-tax in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the impairment of an intangible asset. This asset was established for a domestic service contract client of the Company's Assurant Solutions segment as part of a previously disclosed 2008 acquisition.
The impairment charge results from the Company's receipt, on November 30, 2010, of notice that the client would not renew its contract with the Company after June 1, 2011.

Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2010.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2, 2011 
"During 2010, we demonstrated our ability to adapt to changes affecting our business while delivering solid results to our shareholders," said Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO of Assurant. "We continued to improve operational efficiency and to demonstrate prudent management of our capital. At the same time, we were able to develop revenue opportunities that we can build upon in 2011."
Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income
1
for the fourth quarter 2010 increased 14 percent to $115.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2009 net operating income of $101.6 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, due to improvements at Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits. The quarter included a $30.9 million after-tax intangible asset impairment at Assurant Solutions.
Net loss for the fourth quarter 2010 was $184.4 million, or $(1.74) per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2009 net income of $11.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. The fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 include goodwill impairment charges of $306.4 million and $83.0 million, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges are not tax-deductible. Fourth quarter 2010 and 2009 include changes in the tax valuation allowance.
Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter 2010 decreased 6 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion in fourth quarter 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter 2010 increased 3 percent to $177.8 million, compared to $172.5 million in fourth quarter 2009, as total invested assets remained stable and yields improved slightly.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income for 2010 increased 20 percent to $560.1 million, or $5.02 per diluted share, compared to $464.9 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, in 2009. Results at Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits produced year-over-year improvement.
Net income for the year decreased 35 percent to $279.2 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, versus $430.6 million, or $3.63 per diluted share for the same period in 2009. The goodwill impairment charges significantly impacted net income in each year. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $31.5 million for full-year 2010, compared to net realized losses of $34.8 million in 2009. Net income for 2009 included an $83.5 million after-tax benefit from a favorable legal settlement.
Net earned premiums for 2010 were $7.4 billion, down from $7.6 billion in 2009, primarily due to reduced premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income for 2010 was $703.2 million, compared to $698.8 million for 2009. Invested assets increased but were offset by lower investment yields.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last eight quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income decreased for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 from a $30.9 million after-tax intangible asset impairment in the domestic service contract business. Absent this charge, net operating income for the quarter and year increased driven by improved international and preneed performance. The international combined ratio improved for the quarter and full-year 2010 mainly from improved loss experience, primarily in the UK. International results included $8.4 million after-tax of restructuring charges in 2009. In 2010 the domestic combined ratio increased in the fourth quarter and full year, reflecting the intangible asset impairment and less favorable results from former clients no longer in business.
Net earned premiums decreased for the quarter and full-year 2010, primarily due to reduced domestic service contract sales in 2009 from former clients that are no longer in business and the continued run-off of the domestic credit business. International net earned premiums increased in full-year 2010 as a result of new and existing client growth, primarily in Latin America. Preneed fee income increased for the quarter and the year primarily because of strong growth in Canada.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income in fourth quarter 2010 declined primarily due to $9.8 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses arising from Arizona wind and hailstorms. Reportable catastrophe losses were $14.8 million after-tax during 2010, compared to no reportable catastrophes in 2009. Full-year 2010 net operating income was up due to lower expenses. Results for 2010 include a $7.6 million after-tax favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the quarter and were flat for full-year 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in ceded premiums. Growth in lender-placed homeowners, flood and renters premiums in the quarter and for full-year 2010 partially offset the decline. Results for 2010 include a $13.6 million favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Assurant Health
 
NM = Not Meaningful
Net operating income was up for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 due to reduced expense ratios and improved loss ratios reflecting pricing and plan design changes. Restructuring charges totaled $3.8 million after-tax in the fourth quarter and $8.8 million for full-year 2010. Full-year 2010 net operating income includes a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from a reserve decrease related to a legal settlement, compared to $32.1 million of after-tax legal charges in 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 results included $29.4 million after-tax of legal, restructuring and H1N1-related medical charges.
Net earned premiums decreased in the quarter and for the year resulting from a decline in small group and short-term medical premiums. Individual medical premiums were flat for the fourth quarter and up for full-year 2010.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 increased due to favorable loss experience in all product lines. Favorable disability results and life mortality, as well as dental pricing actions, contributed to the improvement. Results for the year include a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge versus $2.5 million after-tax of restructuring charges for 2009.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the quarter. Net earned premiums increased for full-year 2010 as a result of the acquisition of a block of business and reinsurance clients added in fourth quarter 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the fourth quarter and year increased primarily due to compensation and pension-related costs.
Goodwill Impairment
As disclosed on Jan. 24, 2011, following the completion of its annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $306.4 million to net income, or $2.86 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2010. The goodwill impairment charge at Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits resulted from the effects of healthcare reform, the low interest rate environment, continuing high unemployment and the slow pace of the economic recovery. The charge does not impact cash flow from operations.
Capital Position
Assurant repurchased 4.5 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $163.8 million during the fourth quarter 2010. For full-year 2010, the Company repurchased 15.2 million shares totaling $533.0 million. In 2011, through Jan. 31, the Company repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $65.7 million, with $772.4 million remaining in the repurchase authorization.
During the fourth quarter 2010, corporate capital increased to approximately $880 million from $710 million at Sept. 30, 2010.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), decreased to $4.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, from $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009.
Book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 6.4 percent to $43.08, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI of $285.5 million improved by $219.6 million from Dec. 31, 2009 primarily due to additional net unrealized gains in invested assets.
The operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
was 12.1 percent for the full-year 2010, compared to 10.1 percent in 2009.
As of Dec. 31, 2010, total assets were approximately $26.4 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 17.9 percent at Dec. 31, 2010, compared to 17 percent at Dec. 31, 2009, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.8 to 1.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
NEW YORK, April 27, 2011 
Net operating income
1
for the first quarter 2011 decreased 10 percent to $139.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 net operating income of $154.3 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. Improved results at Assurant Solutions were offset by declines at the other businesses during the quarter.
"First quarter results were consistent with our plans to respond and adapt our operations to the changing markets we serve," said Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO of Assurant. "We increased book value per share by 3 percent, returned $190 million to our shareholders through disciplined capital deployment and are focused on growing revenue in our select specialty markets to ensure long-term success."
Net income for the first quarter 2011 decreased 10 percent to $141.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2010 net income of $157.2 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $2.4 million in the quarter, compared to $2.9 million in first quarter 2010.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income in the quarter were $1.9 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in the first quarter 2010, reflecting a decline in premiums in all of the businesses.
Net investment income in the first quarter 2011 decreased slightly to $171.9 million, compared to $174.0 million in first quarter 2010, as investment yields declined.
Following is a Reconciliation of Net Operating Income to Net Income for Assurant.
 
Note: A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last five quarters is available on page 20 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available in the Investor Relations section of Assurant's website at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income increased in first quarter 2011 due to improved underwriting experience in international operations and continued favorable preneed results. For the quarter, the international combined ratio decreased because of improved loss experience in the U.K. The domestic combined ratio declined slightly as a result of reduced expenses. First quarter 2010 results included an unfavorable $2.8 million tax expense related to European business restructuring.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income declined, reflecting the run-off of both service contract premiums from former clients and the domestic credit business. International net earned premiums increased primarily due to growth from both existing and new clients added last year in Latin America. Preneed fee income increased for the quarter, benefiting from sales growth in the U.S.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income in first quarter 2011 included $7.4 million of after-tax adverse loss development relating to Arizona wind and hailstorms that occurred in fourth quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 benefited from the addition of new clients in 2010, resulting in an increase in the number of loans tracked. First quarter 2010 income included a favorable $7.6 million after-tax adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income were lower for the quarter, reflecting additional ceding activity to clients and increased catastrophe reinsurance premiums. This was partially offset by rising premiums from new lender-placed homeowners' clients added last year and increased renters insurance premiums. First quarter 2010 premiums included a favorable $13.6 million adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Assurant Health
 
 
First quarter 2011 results reflect the impact of health care reform. Income was reduced by $14.6 million after-tax due to the establishment of a premium rebate liability to comply with the minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements. Tax rates increased due to reduced deductions allowed under health care reform. First quarter 2011 results also included a $4.8 million after-tax reimbursement from a pharmacy services provider.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income for the quarter were reduced by $22.4 million due to the new premium rebate liability. Declines in individual and small group premiums also reflect lower sales caused by the transition to new products and changes in commissions, both resulting from health care reform.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income in first quarter 2011 decreased, primarily reflecting slower recovery rates in disability and less favorable life insurance loss experience. Dental results improved during the quarter. First quarter 2011 results also were affected unfavorably by a previously disclosed decrease in the reserve discount rate for new long-term disability claims.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income decreased for the quarter, primarily due to pricing actions on a block of assumed disability reinsurance business and lower sales last year.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the first quarter improved versus 2010 primarily due to a change in certain tax liabilities.
Capital Position
Corporate capital stood at approximately $585 million as of March 31, 2011. Assurant returned $189.6 million to shareholders during first quarter 2011 through share repurchases and dividends. Assurant repurchased 4.4 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $173.4 million during the quarter. Through April 21, 2011, the Company repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $42.3 million, with $622.4 million remaining in the repurchase authorization.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was $4.5 billion at March 31, 2011, almost flat versus Dec. 31, 2010.
Book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 3.2 percent to $44.44, from $43.08 at Dec. 31, 2010. AOCI improved by $11.5 million from Dec. 31, 2010 to $297.0 million.
Annualized operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
, excluding AOCI, was 12.5 percent for the quarter, compared to full-year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, of 12.1 percent in 2010.
As of March 31, 2011, total assets were approximately $26.7 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was flat at 17.9 percent at March 31, 2011, versus Dec. 31, 2010, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.9 to 1.

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, if any, within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 2. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors.
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the time, place, if any, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be given not earlier than sixty, nor less than ten, days previous thereto, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting at such address as appears on the records of the corporation.
Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation; but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the stockholders present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 5. The Chairman of the Board, or in the Chairman's absence or at the Chairman's direction, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer's absence or

The Secretary of the corporation or, in such officer's absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the Chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the Chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting, whether any stockholder or stockholders' proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the Chairman, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no such inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Proxies shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate.
 
Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the corporation or its securities, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 8. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders (a) entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or (b) entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date (i) in the case of clause (a) above, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting and (ii) in the case of clause (b) above, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such action. If for any reason the Board of Directors shall not have fixed a record date for any such purpose, the record date for such purpose shall be determined as provided by law. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed or determined shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date so fixed or determined.
Section 9. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the corporation. The list shall also be produced at the time and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 10. The corporation, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the corporation or candidates for office. In the event that the corporation fails to so appoint inspectors or, in the event that one or more inspectors previously designated by the corporation fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them by statute. Inspectors shall, subject to the power of the Chairman of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.

Nominations of stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the stockholder's notice as required by paragraph (A)(2) of this By-Law shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.
Special Meetings of Stockholders.
(C)  (1) Subject to Article II hereof, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or
General.
 
that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(2) For purposes of this By-Law, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) For purposes of this By-Law, no adjournment or postponement nor notice of adjournment or postponement of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice of such meeting for purposes of this Section 11, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 11 to be timely, such notification must be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the originally scheduled meeting.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law. Nothing in this By-Law shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or the rights of the holders of any class or series of capital stock to elect directors pursuant to any provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 1. Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of the corporation shall consist of such number of directors as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Directors shall be elected annually for a term of one year or until their respective successors are elected and qualified, as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. Directors shall (except as hereinafter provided for the filling of vacancies and newly created directorships) be elected by the holders of a majority of votes cast; provided, however, that if the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the director nominees shall be elected by a plurality of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote. For purposes of this Section 1, a majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director's election. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the
 
Board of Directors has established guidelines pursuant to which any incumbent director who is not elected shall promptly offer to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Board of Directors. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as otherwise provided by law or by the corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 2. Unless otherwise required by law and except as provided in the next succeeding sentence or Section 4 of this Article II, newly created directorships in the Board of Directors that result from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and the directors so chosen shall hold office for a term as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
Section 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or the President, or written notice including, telegraph, telex or transmission of a telecopy, e-mail or other means of transmission, duly served on or sent or mailed to each director to such director's address or telecopy number as shown on the books of the corporation not less than 24 hours before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person (except when the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing.
Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by series or class, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Certificate of Designation or Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as the case may be, applicable thereto. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock, if any, shall be in addition to the number fixed by or pursuant to the By-Laws. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such series or class, the number of directors that may be so elected by the holders of any such series or class of stock shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and vacancies among directors so elected by the separate vote of the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by such series or class, or, if
 
there are no such remaining directors, by the holders of such series or class in the same manner in which such series or class initially elected a director.
Section 5. If at any meeting for the election of directors, the corporation has outstanding more than one class of stock, and one or more such classes or series thereof are entitled to vote separately as a class, and there shall be a quorum of only one such class or series of stock, that class or series of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding absence of a quorum of the other class or series of stock.
Section 6. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation.
Section 7. Unless otherwise restricted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law.
Section 8. The members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person at such a meeting.
Section 9. The Board of Directors may establish policies for the compensation of directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the corporation.
Section 1. The Board of Directors, after each annual meeting of the stockholders, shall elect officers of the corporation, including a President and a Secretary. The Board of Directors may also from time to time elect such other officers (including one or more Vice Presidents, a Treasurer, one or more Assistant Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power to appoint and remove any such other officers and to
 
prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior or Corporate, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations as the Board of Directors may determine. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person. The Board of Directors may also elect or appoint a Chairman of the Board who may or may not be an officer of the corporation.
Section 2. All officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors shall hold office for such term as may be determined by the Board of Directors or until their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors.
Section 3. Each of the officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors or appointed by an officer in accordance with these By-Laws shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-Laws or by the Board of Directors and, in the case of appointed officers, the powers and duties prescribed by the appointing officer, and, unless otherwise prescribed by the By-Laws or by the Board of Directors or such appointing officer, shall have such further powers and duties as ordinarily pertain to that office. The President, as determined by the Board of Directors, shall be the Chief Executive Officer and shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation.
Section 4. Unless otherwise provided in these By-Laws, in the absence or disability of any officer of the corporation, the Board of Directors may, during such period, delegate such officer's powers and duties to any other officer or to any director and the person to whom such powers and duties are delegated shall, for the time being, hold such office.
Section 1. The shares of stock of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, or as otherwise permitted by law, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.
Section 2. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the corporation by the holder of the shares in person or by such holder's attorney upon surrender and cancellation of
 
certificates for a like number of shares, or as otherwise provided by law with respect to uncertificated shares.

Except as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, these By-Laws may be amended, added to, rescinded or repealed at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, provided notice of the proposed change was given in the notice of the meeting of the stockholders or, in the case of a meeting of the Board of Directors, in a notice given not less than two days prior to the meeting; , , that, notwithstanding any other provisions of these By-Laws or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the stockholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding voting power of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal Section 2 and Section 11 of Article I, Sections 1, 6 and 7 of Article II, Article X or this proviso to this Article IX of these By-Laws or to adopt any provision inconsistent with any of such Sections or with this proviso.
provided
however
Section 1. The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a "Covered Person") who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or, while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article X, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation.
Section 2. The corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article X or otherwise.
Section 3. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article X is not paid in full
 
within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
Section 4. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article X shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 5. The corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.
Section 6. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article X shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 7. This Article X shall not limit the right of the corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.
Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XI.

Vesting during the Restriction Period
(c) . Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason other than Retirement (as defined below), death or Disability during the Restriction Period, all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to the Participant's Retirement, the restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock Units shall immediately lapse, and such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested; and (ii) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to death or Disability, the Participant shall vest in, and the Restricted Period shall terminate with respect to, a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the total number of Restricted Stock Units and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the Restriction Period from the Grant Date until the date of Termination of Employment ( that, for this purpose, the month in which the Grant Date occurs shall be considered a full month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Restriction Period over (B) the number of Restricted Stock Units that previously vested as of the Termination of Employment without respect to this provision.

Settlement of Units
3. . The Participant shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units that are outstanding under this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents represent the right to receive an amount equal to the aggregate regular cash dividends that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled, cancelled or forfeited of a number of Shares equal to the applicable number of Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, in cash, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 calendar days following, the applicable record date for each such cash dividend.

Any purported or attempted transfer of such Shares or such rights shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of the Restricted Stock Units
5. . During the Restriction Period, the Participant shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting rights).
Rights as a Stockholder
6. . In the event of certain transactions during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4 of the Plan or any applicable successor provision under the Plan. In the event of a Change of Control before the Restricted Stock Units vest, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested, consistent with Section 9.1 of the Plan, and shall be settled within 5 calendar days following the Change of Control; , that any Restricted Stock Units that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code shall not be settled upon such Change of Control unless the Change of Control constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and will instead be settled at such time as specified in Section 2.

The obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 8, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant, including deducting such amount from the delivery of shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that gives rise to the withholding requirement.

-- Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that it has purchased SureDeposit, the leading provider of security deposit alternatives to the multifamily renters industry, in an all-cash transaction from Converge Services Group, LLC.
NEW YORK, June 22, 2011
"Assurant targets acquisition opportunities which enhance our existing specialty businesses and provide long-term growth opportunities for our shareholders," said Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO of Assurant, Inc. "SureDeposit is an excellent strategic fit with our Specialty Property business and the purchase will be modestly accretive to earnings from the start. With a purchase price of less than $50 million, this acquisition reinforces our commitment to disciplined deployment of capital as we add complementary specialty products to our business portfolio in balance with share repurchases."
Assurant will discuss financial details of the transaction on its second quarter conference call scheduled for July 28, 2011.
"The dynamic renters market in the U.S. makes this new product offering for Assurant Specialty Property particularly attractive to multifamily property managers and consumers looking for alternatives to traditional security deposits," said Gene Mergelmeyer, president and CEO of Assurant Specialty Property. Kathy McDonald, the Property Solutions business unit president added, "SureDeposit fits well with our group, expands our risk management offerings, creates natural cross-selling opportunities and will provide new revenue streams in this growing market niche."
SureDeposit, a privately held company headquartered in Livingston, N.J., has longstanding relationships with multifamily property managers and owners in 43 states. SureDeposit offers renters a surety bond alternative to the traditional security deposit by allowing residents at participating apartment communities the option of avoiding more expensive security deposits with the payment of a one-time bond premium. This makes it easier for residents to move into their new rental units at a fraction of the cost of a traditional security deposit. In the event of damage at the end of the lease, SureDeposit reimburses the property manager or owner, and the renter in turn reimburses the surety bond company. SureDeposit has more than 1,500,000 apartment units under agreements in nearly 4,500 communities nationwide. The SureDeposit workforce of 35 employees is being offered employment with Assurant Specialty Property.
"We are proud to join the Assurant team to expand the reach of SureDeposit's unique risk management and marketing programs," said Stuart Litwin and Dan Rudd, founders of SureDeposit. "Our unique product offering continues to gain traction among multifamily property managers and owners nationwide, underscoring the strength of our company, the commitment and professionalism of our employees, and our great client relationships. With the added resources of the Assurant team behind us, we expect the momentum to accelerate."

Exhibit 99.1
 
Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
NEW YORK, July 27, 2011 
Net operating income
1
for the second quarter 2011 decreased 50 percent to $75.4 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 net operating income of $152.2 million, or $1.35 per diluted share. Catastrophe losses and increases in loss frequency due to other weather-related activity at Assurant Specialty Property and reduced earnings at Assurant Health drove the decline.
"Second quarter operating results reflect our continuing efforts to deliver on our customer commitments and achieve long-term value for our shareholders," said Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO of Assurant. "Improved results at Assurant Solutions, ongoing operating improvements at Assurant Health and increased sales at Assurant Employee Benefits were consistent with our priorities for the year. At the same time, results reflect the impact of storm-related claims as we quickly responded to help our customers recover and rebuild."
Net income for the second quarter 2011 increased to $165.9 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2010 net income of $164.7 million, or $1.46 per diluted share. Net income benefited from an $80.0 million reduction in a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $10.5 million in the quarter, compared to $12.5 million in second quarter 2010.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income in the quarter decreased slightly to $1.9 billion, primarily due to a decline in premiums at Assurant Health.
Net investment income in second quarter 2011 decreased slightly to $173.8 million, compared to $175.2 million in second quarter 2010, as investment yields declined.
Following is a Reconciliation of Net Operating Income to Net Income for Assurant.
 
Note: A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last six quarters is available on page 20 of the Company's Financial Supplement, located in the Investor Relations section of Assurant's website at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income increased in second quarter 2011 due to improved domestic and international underwriting experience. The international combined ratio declined, reflecting improved loss experience in the U.K. and growth in Latin America. The domestic combined ratio declined, benefiting from favorable loss experience in the service contract business and reduced expenses.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income declined slightly in second quarter 2011. Growth in both domestic and international premiums was offset by the continued run-off of the domestic credit business and service contract premiums from former clients. Revenues continued to grow in preneed insurance.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income declined in the quarter, reflecting $42.7 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses compared to $5.0 million in second quarter 2010. Second quarter 2011 results also were affected by additional increases in loss frequency primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related activity.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income declined in second quarter 2011 due to increases in premiums ceded to clients and higher catastrophe reinsurance premiums. Increased premiums from new lender-placed homeowners' clients added in 2010, loan growth by existing clients and growth in renters insurance premiums partially offset the decline.
Assurant Health
 
* Note: Beginning in first quarter 2011, results are not fully comparable to the prior year due to regulatory changes associated with health care reform.
Results for second quarter 2011 continued to reflect the impact of health care reform. Net operating income was reduced by $10.9 million after-tax due to an accrual for premium rebates associated with minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements. Expenses continued to decline as a result of organizational and operational changes.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income for second quarter 2011 declined due partially to a $16.7 million premium rebate accrual. During the quarter, premiums for Assurant Health's affordable choice and supplemental products increased.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income in second quarter 2011 decreased, reflecting slower disability recovery rates and less favorable life insurance loss experience compared to 2010. Improved dental business results partially offset these declines. Second quarter 2011 results also were unfavorably affected by a previously disclosed decrease in the reserve discount rate for new long-term disability claims. Second quarter 2010 results included a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income decreased for the quarter primarily due to pricing actions on a block of assumed disability business and lower sales in 2010. Premium growth in voluntary and supplemental products partially offset the decline.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss increased mainly from higher tax expense during second quarter 2011. Second quarter 2010 results included a $2.9 million after-tax restructuring charge.
Capital Position
Corporate capital was approximately $650 million as of June 30, 2011, up from $585 million at March 31, 2011. During second quarter 2011, Assurant acquired SureDeposit, a leading provider of security deposit alternatives, to broaden Specialty Property's product offerings.
Assurant repurchased 3.0 million of its common shares, or 3 percent of the common stock outstanding at the end of first quarter 2011, for $110.4 million. Through July 22, 2011, the Company repurchased an additional 512,000 shares for approximately $18.0 million, with $536.4 million remaining in the repurchase authorization. The Company also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 from $0.16 per common share during the second quarter.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), was $4.5 billion at June 30, 2011, flat versus Dec. 31, 2010.
Book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 7.1 percent to $46.16, from $43.08 at Dec. 31, 2010. AOCI improved by $95.7 million to $381.3 million as of June 30, 2011 from Dec. 31, 2010.
Annualized operating return on average equity (ROE)
3
, excluding AOCI, was 9.6 percent for the first six months of 2011, compared to full-year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, of 12.1 percent in 2010.
As of June 30, 2011, total assets were approximately $26.8 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, declined slightly to 17.8 percent at June 30, 2011, versus 17.9 percent at Dec. 31, 2010, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.8 to 1.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2011.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 2011 
Net operating income
1
for the third quarter 2011 decreased 45 percent to $75.6 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2010 net operating income of $137.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share. Catastrophe losses of $52.3 million after-tax at Assurant Specialty Property drove the decline.
"Losses caused by storms reduced earnings, but our response demonstrated the value our products provide to customers when catastrophes occur," said Robert B. Pollock, president and CEO of Assurant. "We continued to build value for our shareholders through new sales in all of our businesses and maintained our sharp focus on improving operations."
Net income for the third quarter 2011 decreased 46 percent to $76.0 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2010 net income of $141.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share. Results were affected by catastrophe losses at Assurant Specialty Property.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income in the quarter decreased slightly to $1.9 billion, reflecting a decline in premiums primarily at Assurant Health.
Net investment income in third quarter 2011 decreased 2 percent to $172.2 million, compared to $176.2 million in third quarter 2010, as investment yields declined.
Following is a Reconciliation of Net Operating Income to Net Income for Assurant.
 
Note: A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last seven quarters is available on page 20 of the Company's Financial Supplement, located in the Investor Relations section of Assurant's website at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income increased in the quarter, primarily reflecting improved international underwriting experience. The international combined ratio declined due to improved underwriting experience, primarily in Canada and in Latin America.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income were flat compared to third quarter 2010. Growth in both international and domestic premiums as well as preneed fee income were offset by the continued run-off of the domestic credit business and service contract premiums from former clients.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income declined in the quarter primarily due to $52.3 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses. Third quarter 2010 results included no reportable catastrophe losses. Third quarter 2011 results also were affected by increased frequency of non-catastrophe weather related losses.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income were slightly lower in the quarter primarily due to an increase in ceded lender-placed premiums. This was partially offset by growth in premiums from new lender-placed homeowners' clients added in 2010, client loan portfolio acquisitions and growth in premiums from renters products.
Assurant Health
 
 
Third quarter 2011 results continued to reflect the impact of health care reform. Organizational and operational changes reduced expenses and improved net operating income. Results were unfavorably affected by a $6.0 million after-tax accrual for premium rebates associated with the minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements and a high effective tax rate.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income for third quarter 2011 reflected a decline in traditional individual medical product sales and an increase in supplemental and affordable choice products sales. Results also decreased by $9.3 million due to the premium rebate accrual.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income in third quarter 2011 decreased due to less favorable disability experience. Improved life and dental business results partially offset the decline. Results also were unfavorably affected by a previously disclosed decrease in the reserve discount rate for new long-term disability claims.
Net earned premiums, fees and other income decreased for the quarter primarily due to pricing actions on a block of previously assumed disability business. Premium growth in voluntary and supplemental products partially offset the decline.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss decreased in the third quarter 2011 due to lower tax and compensation-related expenses.
Capital Position
Corporate capital was approximately $640 million as of Sept. 30, 2011, down from $650 million at June 30, 2011. Assurant returned $93.4 million to shareholders during third quarter 2011 through share repurchases and dividends. Assurant repurchased 2.2 million of its common shares, or 2 percent of the common stock outstanding at the end of second quarter 2011, for $76.2 million. Through Oct. 21, 2011, the Company repurchased an additional 652,000 shares for approximately $23.8 million, with $454 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), was $4.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2011, flat versus Dec. 31, 2010.
Book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 9 percent to $47.13, from $43.08 at Dec. 31, 2010. The 2011 book value includes a benefit from an $80.0 million reduction in a tax valuation allowance. AOCI improved by $239 million to $524 million as of Sept. 30, 2011 from Dec. 31, 2010.
Annualized operating return on average equity (ROE)
3
, excluding AOCI, was 8.6 percent for the first nine months of 2011, compared to full-year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, of 12.1 percent in 2010.
As of Sept. 30, 2011, total assets were approximately $26.8 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital
4
, excluding AOCI, declined slightly to 17.8 percent at Sept. 30, 2011, versus 17.9 percent at Dec. 31, 2010, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.8 to 1.

Assurant will host a conference call on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. ET with webcast access available via the Investor Relations section of Assurant's website, www.assurant.com.

NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2012
-- Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that certain of its subsidiaries have entered into reinsurance agreements providing for $130 million in three-year, fully collateralized reinsurance from Ibis Re II Ltd., a special purpose reinsurance company domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Bonds issued by Ibis Re Ltd. in 2009, for $150 million, will expire in May 2012.
Ibis Re II financed the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage by issuing $130 million in catastrophe bonds to qualified institutional buyers. The coverage complements Assurant's traditional catastrophe reinsurance, which provides broad protection from catastrophic storm activity to the company's clients and shareholders.
As a component of Assurant's comprehensive risk management program, the Ibis Re II reinsurance consists of two separate layers of coverage for protection against losses from individual hurricane events in Hawaii, Puerto Rico and along the Gulf and Eastern Coasts of the United States.
"We are pleased to have successfully placed this property catastrophe reinsurance coverage, which supplements Assurant's Catastrophe Reinsurance Program," said Gene Mergelmeyer, president and CEO of Assurant Specialty Property. "Guided by a long-term perspective and a strong risk management strategy, Assurant continually works to further protect our clients and shareholders from the risk created by catastrophic storm activity."
Additional details regarding Assurant's Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for 2012 will be announced after the placement of the program with reinsurers this summer.

Company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other AOCI items. The comparable GAAP measure would be book value per diluted share, defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $55.71 and $53.46 as of March 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, respectively, as shown in the reconciliation table below.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
American Security Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company"), reached agreement with the California Department of Insurance to reduce the premium rates for its lender-placed hazard insurance product by 30.5 percent.
Insurance rates can vary significantly between states based on actual loss experience, catastrophe exposure, state requirements and prospective views of product and market performance. This rate reduction reflects factors specific to California including continued favorable loss experience in the state and different assumptions about future experience.   
The new rates in California will be implemented in January 2013 and will apply to policies issued or renewed with effective dates after implementation.
For 2012, American Security Insurance Company estimates that it will record approximately $140 million of gross written premiums and $108 million of net earned premiums in California for the type of policies that are subject to the rate reduction. This is based on actual September year-to-date California results of $105 million in gross written premiums and $81 million in net earned premiums.
On the basis of 2012 placement rates and the current book of business, the Company estimates that annualized net earned premiums and net income would be reduced by approximately $33 million and $18 million, respectively. The actual effect of the California rate decrease on the Company's net earned premiums and net income over the course of 2013 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's mix of lender-placed insurance products, lapse rates, rate and timing of renewals, placement rates, changes in client contracts and actual expenses incurred.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT -- The statements in the preceding paragraph constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates we have given because of a variety of factors, including those listed above, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K as a result of new information or future events or developments.

Item 2.05.    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On November 14, 2012, Assurant Solutions, a segment of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company"), notified employees of workforce reductions as part of its overall efforts to reduce operating expenses and increase organizational efficiencies.
These workforce reductions are primarily in the segment's domestic credit insurance/debt deferment business and also include reductions in the U.K./European operations. This process is expected to be completed by year-end 2012 and the Company estimates that severance and outplacement costs will result in an after-tax charge of approximately $7.3 million to consolidated and segment fourth quarter net income. The Company expects substantially all of this charge to result in future cash expenditures in the approximate amount described above.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") has estimated the reportable catastrophe losses related to Superstorm Sandy to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. The principal cause of loss was flood, along with wind and water damage. The largest concentration of losses occurred in the coastal communities of New York and New Jersey. Based on the above estimate, the Company does not expect to exceed the retention limit of its 2012 property catastrophe reinsurance program.
The Company's reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Superstorm Sandy is the only reportable loss event in the fourth quarter of 2012 to date. Actual losses from the storm will be reported in the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release expected for February 6, 2013 after 4:00 p.m. ET.
The Company issued a related news release, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
[  ]   Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [  ]   Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
Item 2.06.    Material Impairments
 
On January 15, 2013, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that it will take a non-cash charge of approximately $27 million pre-tax ($20 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2012 for the impairment of certain other intangible assets in the Assurant Solutions segment. These assets were established primarily in connection with the 2007 acquisitions of two U.K. mortgage insurance brokers. These assets were being amortized based on the expected future persistency of the acquired business.
In mid-2012, persistency rates of the acquired business declined significantly following actions by an independent underwriter of the business, resulting in the impairment charge. Subsequently, the Company negotiated arrangements with new underwriters. The non-cash impairment charge is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Company's normal business operations, cash position or cash flows from operating activities, or to result in future cash expenditures.
The Company also has completed its annual goodwill impairment testing for the Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property reporting units in accordance with ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other." Based on the results of the testing, the Company has concluded that the estimated fair value of these reporting units was greater than their carrying value and as a result no goodwill impairment charge was necessary in fourth quarter 2012.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT - Some of the statements included in this Form 8-K, particularly projections as to future earnings, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's best estimates, assumptions and projections and are subject to significant uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K as a result of new information or future events or developments. In addition, the statements above regarding the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing are limited to the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing for 2012, and no assurance can be made with respect to any future testing of the Company's goodwill. For a detailed discussion of the general risk factors that could affect the Company's results, please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's annual and periodic reports, including but not limited to its 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Third Quarter 2012 Form 10-Q, each as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Dear                     :
We are writing to you pursuant to a settlement between the New York State Department of Financial Services and American Security Insurance Company ("ASIC") and American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida ("ABIC") concerning force-placed insurance policies issued in New York State by ASIC and ABIC. You are receiving this Notice and Claim Form because you were charged for force-placed insurance by ASIC or ABIC.
Force-placed insurance is insurance taken out by your bank, lender or mortgage servicer when you do not maintain the insurance required by the terms of your mortgage. This can occur if you allow your homeowners' insurance policy to lapse or if your bank or mortgage servicer determines that you do not have a sufficient amount of coverage. On some occasions, homeowners have been force-placed erroneously. In many instances, the premiums for the force-placed coverage are far in excess of the premiums you were charged for your voluntary homeowners' insurance. Force-placed insurance is also sometimes referred to as lender-placed insurance.
Under the terms of the settlement, you may be entitled to a refund for some of the charges you incurred in connection with your force-placed insurance. Please complete the below questionnaire and provide copies of supporting documents, where applicable, if you believe you may qualify for a refund.
DO NOT SEND ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS.
To qualify for a refund, you must have been force-placed by ASIC or ABIC on or after January 1, 2008 and meet the eligibility criteria for one of the following three categories of claimants:
 
 
 
 
Please note that you are not eligible if the force-placed insurance policies for which you were charged were cancelled and if the charge for the force-placed insurance premium was refunded or credited back to you or your escrow account with your lender.

Yes No
        
        
 
 
Yes No
        
        
 
If you satisfy the requirements for eligibility in this category, you will receive a refund equal to the difference between the force-placed premium amount and the premium that would have been assessed for the period in question under your last known voluntary policy had it remained in effect.
 
Yes No
        
        
 
Yes No
        
        
If you satisfy the requirements for eligibility in this category, you will receive a refund in the amount equal to the difference between ASIC's or ABIC's force-placed premium that you paid and the amount authorized under your mortgage.

Yes No
        
        
If yes, please enclosed a copy of the relevant real property records. Do not send originals.
If you satisfy the requirements for eligibility under this category you will receive a payment in the amount of either (1) the force-placed insurance premium actually paid by you and not subsequently refunded for periods when other acceptable coverage was in effect, or (2) the difference between the commercial force-placed insurance premiums actually paid by you and the ASIC or ABIC residential force-placed insurance premiums that should have been charged, as the case may be.
 
I state that the information provided above is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.
 
THIS NOTICE AND CLAIM FORM AND ALL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE MAILED TO [THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR] AT [ADDRESS] AND SHOULD BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN             , 2013 FOR YOUR REFUND CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED.
If you have a copy of your prior voluntary homeowner's insurance policy or declaration page, please provide a copy with your submission.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded, based upon the opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by Merrill Lynch and J.P.

S 10. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 10.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 10, each director, officer, employee and affiliate of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 5, 7, 9, 10 and 18 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.

Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
 
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record
 
Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any
 
Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
(1) either
(A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, or
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
 
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company (including all sums payable pursuant to Section 607 herein); and
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
 
"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
 
(2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; , that neither the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act or Section 704(1) of this Indenture nor the failure to file a report with the Commission as contemplated by Section 704(1) or otherwise shall constitute an event, which with the giving of notice and the passage of time pursuant to this clause (4), would constitute an Event of Default; or
provided
(5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any
 
substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or
(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
 
and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
The Company covenants that if
(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
 
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
provided, however,
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively.
 
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
 
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, that
provided
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and
(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or
(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.
provided
 
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
 
If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.
provided, however,
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 601:
(1) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
(2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;
(3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;
(4) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
(5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
(6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and
(7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.
 
Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
 
The Company agrees
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and
(3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim, action or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
 
If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series or a successor trustee under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of February 18, 2004 between the Company and SunTrust Bank, as trustee, wherein the Trustee acts as successor trustee under this referenced indenture.
 
There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such, has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and has its Corporate Trust Office in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
 
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
If at any time:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
 
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
 
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
 
merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee
(1) semi-annually, not later than December 31 and June 30 in each year, a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities of each series as of the preceding June 15 or December 16 as the case may be, and
(2) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished;
from any such list names and addresses received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar.
excluding
 
The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 701 and the names and addresses of Holders received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.
 
The Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto.
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which any Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on any stock exchange.
 
The Company shall:
(1) file with the Trustee, within 15 days after the Company has filed the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or
 
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of said Sections, then it shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations;
(2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and
(3) transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.
 
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, and the Company shall not permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into the Company or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to the Company, unless:
(1) in case the Company shall consolidate with or merge into another Person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety shall be a corporation, partnership or trust, shall be organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on all the Securities and the performance or observance of every covenant of this Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and treating any indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company or such Subsidiary
 
at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing;
(3) if, as a result of any such consolidation or merger or such conveyance, transfer or lease, properties or assets of the Company would become subject to a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance which would not be permitted by this Indenture, the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall take such steps as shall be necessary effectively to secure the Securities equally and ratably with (or prior to) all indebtedness secured thereby; and
(4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
 
Upon any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 801, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.
 
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
(1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities; or
(2) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; or
 
(3) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such additional Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such additional Events of Default are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series); or
(4) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form; or
(5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities, that any such addition, change or elimination (A) shall neither (i) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (ii) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or (B) shall become effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding; or
provided
(6) to secure the Securities pursuant to the requirements of Section 1006 or otherwise; or
(7) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 201 and 301; or
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 611; or
(9) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, that such action pursuant to this Clause (9) shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect.
provided
 
With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby,
provided, however,
(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or
 
(2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or
(3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1007, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 1007, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 611 and 901(8).
provided, however,
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
 
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.
 
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided,
 
that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
however,
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee
 
thereof, shall thereupon cease; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
provided, however,
 
The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
 
Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence.
 
(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any debt for money borrowed (hereafter in this Section referred to as "Debt") secured by a mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or other encumbrance upon any shares of stock of any Restricted Subsidiary (whether such shares of stock are now owned or hereafter acquired) without in any such case effectively providing concurrently with the issuance, assumption or guarantee of any such Debt that the Securities (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of or guarantee by the Company ranking equally with the Securities and then existing or thereafter created) shall be secured equally and ratably with such Debt.
(b) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Capital Stock (other than nonvoting preferred stock) of any Restricted Subsidiary (except to the Company or to one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or for the purpose of qualifying directors); that this covenant shall not apply if:
provided, however,
(1) all or any part of such Capital Stock is sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction for consideration which is at least equal to the fair value of such Capital Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors (acting in good faith); or
(2) the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is required to comply with the order of a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction, other than an order issued at the request of the Company or of one of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series or in any of Sections 1005 and 1006 if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article.
 
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
 
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such
 
redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
provided
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register.
All notices of redemption shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date,
(2) the Redemption Price,
(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed,
 
(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price,
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and
(7) if applicable, the CUSIP numbers of the Securities of that series.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.
 
Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, instalments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
provided, however,
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same
 
series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
 
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
 
The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
provided
 
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
 
 
The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 1302 or Section 1303 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 301 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 1302 or 1303, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any such election shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 1303 applied to such Securities.
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 801(3), Section 1005 and Section 1006, and any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(4) (with respect to Section 801(3), Section 1005 and Section 1006, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7)) and 501(7) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such
 
Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1302 or Section 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "U.S. Government Obligation" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation which is specified in Clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt.
provided
(2) In the event of an election to have Section 1302 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to
 
the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.
(3) In the event of an election to have Section 1303 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.
(4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit.
(5) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(5) and (6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act).
(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.
(8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.
(9) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with (in each case, subject to the satisfaction of the condition in clause (5)).
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

HEREOF
Dated: March 28, 2013
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 28, 2013 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' or more than 60 days' notice by mail, at any time, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the Redemption Date; and (ii) the sum, as calculated by the Independent Investment Banker, of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate, as defined below, plus 30 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the Redemption Date.
For the purposes of the foregoing, the following definitions shall apply:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means either of (1) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and (2) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and their respective successors, as selected by the Company, or, if any such firm or the successors, if any, to such firm, as the case may be, are unwilling or unable to serve as such, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and (2) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and ask prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to:
(1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or
(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" above, the term "Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or required by law to remain closed.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee

ITNESS
HEREOF
Dated: March 28, 2013
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 28, 2013 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' or more than 60 days' notice by mail, at any time, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the Redemption Date; and (ii) the sum, as calculated by the Independent Investment Banker, of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate, as defined below, plus 35 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the Redemption Date.
For the purposes of the foregoing, the following definitions shall apply:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means either of (1) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and (2) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and their respective successors, as selected by the Company, or, if any such firm or the successors, if any, to such firm, as the case may be, are unwilling or unable to serve as such, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and (2) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and ask prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to:
(1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or
(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" above, the term "Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or required by law to remain closed.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver
 
or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 

Exhibit 5.1
Assurant, Inc.
One Chase Manhattan Plaza
New York, New York 10005
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Vice President, Chief Corporate Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Assurant, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and as such, have served as counsel for the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Senior Notes due 2018 and $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (together, the "Securities") pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177777) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), on November 7, 2011. The Securities are being issued under an indenture, dated as of March 28, 2013 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, I advise you that, in my opinion, the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the States of Delaware and New York, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
I have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed, without independent verification, that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimens thereof examined by me, that the Securities have been duly authenticated by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, that the Securities have been delivered against payment as contemplated in the Registration Statement and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine.
 
 
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the references to me under the heading "Validity of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement dated March 25, 2013. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.

Exhibit 99.1

New York, March 28, 2013

Assurant intends to use the net proceeds of the Senior Notes offering for general corporate purposes, including to repay $500 million of debt due in 2014.
The offering of the Senior Notes was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the offering.
