Contact: Dean Ridlon Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Continues Momentum with Strong First Quarter Results TEWKSBURY, Mass. (April 16, 2003) - Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today reported strong results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Revenues for the quarter were $112.2 million versus $92 million in the corresponding quarter in 2002. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.4% compared to 48.1% in the first quarter of 2002 reflecting an improved product mix, reduced materials costs and favorable currency exchange rates. The first quarter 2003 gross margin was Avid's highest since the second quarter of 1999. Net income for the quarter was $5.5 million or $.18 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $3.7 million or $.14 per share for the first quarter of 2002. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2003 were charges of $1.2 million for restructuring activities and $600,000 related to vacating certain real estate. Avid's cash and marketable securities increased during the quarter by over $17 million to $106.2 million at March 31, 2003, nearly double the cash balance from the corresponding quarter in 2002. "We're extremely pleased with our results this quarter and the continuation of the momentum we generated throughout 2002," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "In what is typically Avid's slowest quarter, we increased our gross margins, net income and cash balance. This puts Avid in a solid position to further grow our business and improve our profitability as we begin preparations to ship the brand new, revolutionary product line we announced last week at NAB - the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas." While exhibiting at NAB from April 7-10, 2003, Avid unveiled the largest array of new products in the history of its core video business. The company introduced an entirely new nonlinear architecture that combines host-based software editing applications with hardware-based digital nonlinear accelerators (called Avid DNA(TM)) specifically engineered for accelerating media processing. These next-generation solutions offer dramatically increased performance for Avid customers at the high-, mid-, and low-end of its product range, and include: o The Avid(R) DS Nitris(TM) family - Avid's most powerful nonlinear systems to date, capable of delivering real-time effects for up to two streams of 10-bit high-definition media and eight streams of 10-bit uncompressed standard-definition media. o Media Composer(R) Adrenaline(TM) - the fastest, most powerful, compatible and highest-quality Media Composer system ever, designed for time-sensitive production environments and offering unparalleled features, performance and connectivity and the ability to expand to support HD media. o Avid Xpress(R) Pro with Avid Mojo(TM) - a powerful combination of new nonlinear editing software and portable Avid DNA hardware for film and video professionals seeking an affordable, mobile solution that offers true real-time editing for DV media and expandability to support uncompressed standard-definition video. Product introductions at NAB were not solely focused on Avid's core postproduction market. Avid also announced Avid NewsCutter(R) Adrenaline FX and Avid NewsCutter XP with Avid Mojo, two new cutting-edge nonlinear systems for news editing; the Avid Nearchive(TM) system, a first-of-its-kind common media repository that simplifies the process of finding and accessing infrequently
used media that would otherwise be stored on analog tapes in library archives; and the MEDIArray(TM) ZX solution, a high-performance, cost-effective 2.88 TB disk storage subsystem representing the newest building block in the Avid Unity(TM) MediaNetwork family of shared-storage and media management solutions.

(NASDAQ: AVID) today reported record earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter was $15.8 million, or $.47 per diluted share, on revenues of $127.3 million. This compares to net income of $4.3 million, or $.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $112.8 million for the corresponding quarter in 2002.

This compares to net income of $3.0 million, or $.11 per diluted share, on revenues of $418.7 million reported for 2002.

Gross margins for the fourth quarter of 2003 were 57.8%, more than two percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2003 and more than five points higher than the fourth quarter of 2002. Included in the fourth quarter of 2003's operating expenses is a $1.3 million non-cash charge related to vacating real estate subject to long-term leases in the San Francisco area. "Our strong fourth quarter results cap off an extremely successful year for Avid," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Our net income for both the fourth quarter and the full year was our highest ever. We achieved double-digit percentage growth, year-over-year, in our quarterly revenue for both our video and audio segments, resulting in our highest annual revenue growth since 1995. At the same time, we more than doubled our cash balance during the year to nearly $200 million at year-end. Since then, we have used some of these cash reserves to acquire NXN Software AG, which we closed on January 26, 2004. We also increased our stockholders' equity from $123.6 million as of December 31, 2002, to $227.1 million as of December 31, 2003." Krall continued, "These results come at the end of a year in which we delivered some of the most ground-breaking products in our 16-year history, including the new Avid DNA(TM) family.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Avid to Acquire M-Audio
Deal will unite two leaders in the audio industry
Tewksbury, MA
 August 13, 2004  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Midiman, Inc., doing business as M-Audio  a leading provider of digital audio and MIDI solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals.  At closing, Avid will pay approximately $80 million in cash, issue approximately 2 million shares of Avid common stock, and assume all outstanding M-Audio stock options.  The deal also includes earn-out provisions, which would be payable to M-Audio's equity holders based on the successful achievement of certain financial milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, M-Audio will become a business unit of Avid's Digidesign audio division and market its line of computer audio peripherals, PCI sound cards, keyboard controllers and control surfaces, microphones, speakers, and distributed software and proprietary sound libraries alongside Digidesign's award-winning digital audio workstations for the professional and home/hobbyist markets.
 
"Over the past several years, Digidesign has established itself as the clear leader in digital audio solutions for the professional studio and home recording markets," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "With this acquisition, we're bolstering our investment in the home studio market segment, the fastest growing portion of our audio business, where we achieved roughly 40% year-over-year growth in Q2 of 2004.  We believe the addition of M-Audio to the Avid family will put us in a position to provide a complete set of creative tools to the market, from entry-level music hobbyists with home studios to facility owners, recording artists, audio engineers, and film sound professionals."
 
Digidesign general manager and Avid vice president Dave Lebolt commented, "The entry-level audio market offers attractive growth opportunities, and both Digidesign and M-Audio have demonstrated solid successes in this area.  As a combined entity, Digidesign and M-Audio can tap into subsegments of this market that we would not otherwise reach as strongly on our own.  At the same time, Digidesign will continue to focus in the professional audio space, including the expansion we've targeted in the mixing and live sound markets, while M-Audio will further extend its reach to an even wider consumer base.  As
a
result, Avid will have a range of new capabilities to address the audio business, and customers will have a broader set of audio options to meet their increasingly diverse needs."
 
Founded in 1988 and ranked by as one of the fastest-growing companies in the music industry for the last four years, Irwindale, CA-based M-Audio
The Music Trades
has approximately 200 employees in the U.S. and Europe
who develop products for the professional and consumer audio markets.  In recent years, the privately held company has capitalized on the trend toward computer-based audio production by marketing and selling a wide range of the basic tools required for high-quality home recording. These products include USB and FireWire audio interfaces, USB MIDI keyboards and controllers, PCI sound cards, studio reference monitors, microphones, microphone preamps, and sound production libraries.  The company also distributes third-party music production software and audio plug-ins.
 
"Both Digidesign and M-Audio, in our respective markets, have pioneered computer-based audio solutions that deliver professional quality at affordable prices," said M-Audio founder and CEO Tim Ryan, who will continue to oversee M-Audio's operations as the general manager of Digidesign's M-Audio business unit.  "As we move forward, we plan to blend Digidesign's expertise in the professional arena with our proven track record for engineering advanced technology into low-cost, high-quality products. Customers can look forward to continued innovation from M-Audio as we pursue the opportunities that will result from this combination."
 
Terms of the Acquisition Agreement
At closing, Avid will pay approximately $80 million in cash, issue approximately 2 million shares of Avid common stock, and assume all outstanding M-Audio stock options, which will cover approximately 325,000 additional shares of Avid common stock. 
Earn-outs of $20 million and $25 million may be payable to M-Audio's equity holders, for the periods ending January 31, 2005, and December 31, 2005, respectively, based on the successful achievement of certain financial milestones relating to the sale of M-Audio products.  The earn-out payments will be paid in stock based on Avid's stock price at the time the earn-outs are paid.  All shares issued in the acquisition will be registered for resale following the closing.
 
Financial Outlook
M-Audio's
revenues in its fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, were approximately $51.5 million, up more than 30% from its prior fiscal year.  Based on its results for the first half of this year, M-Audio's revenues are expected to grow more than 30% again in fiscal 2004.
Assuming a closing later this month, Avid's revenues for Q3 2004 are expected to be in the area of $143.5 million and for Q4 to be in the area of $162.5 million making the full year 2004 approximately $573 million.  Avid's GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be $.47 in Q3, $.51 in Q4 and $1.88 for the full year 2004.  M-Audio is expected to add more than $20 million to Avid's revenues in 2004 and to increase Avid's pro forma net income, but the acquisition is not expected to be accretive in Q3 and Q4 during the integration process because of the reduction in interest income and the increase in shares outstanding associated with the transaction. 
Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to capitalize approximately $38 million of intangibles and approximately $7 million of deferred compensation. 
Excluding full year acquisition-related amortization of $3.9 million, deferred compensation of $1.9 million, restructuring charges of $1.1 million and an extraordinary tax credit of $1.2 million, pro forma earnings per diluted share are expected to be approximately $.52 in Q3, $.60 in Q4 and $2.04 for the full year.  Average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be 35 million in Q3, 36.5 million in Q4 and 34.8 million for the full year.
 
In light of the size of this acquisition, Avid is providing the following preliminary guidance for 2005 incorporating the expected results of the M-Audio acquisition.  This outlook is likely to change as the integration of M-Audio proceeds and the acquisition accounting is finalized.  The acquisition of M-Audio is expected to significantly add to Avid's top-line in 2005, taking the company's revenues to over $700 million.  Avid's operating profits are expected to be approximately $90 million including acquisition-related amortization and deferred compensation charges totaling $10.5 million.  Pro forma operating income, excluding the acquisition-related amortization and deferred compensation, is expected to be approximately $100 million, or over 14% of revenues.
 
Including acquisition-related amortization of $7.4 million and deferred compensation of $3.1 million, Avid's 2005 net income is expected to be approximately $2.32 per diluted share.  The acquisition is expected to be accretive in 2005 on a pro forma basis.  Excluding the acquisition-related amortization and deferred compensation charges, net income is expected to be in the area of $2.60 per diluted share on approximately 37.5 million diluted shares outstanding.
 
The pro forma operating results listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules.  We have included this information because we believe it is a meaningful measure of our normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis.  This pro forma information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of
performance
in accordance with, disclosures required by GAAP. 
We use this information internally to help our management more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our operations and measure our performance
on a comparative basis
.
 
The company expects to have cash of approximately $125 million at the end of Q3 and approximately $150 million at the end of 2004.
 
The boards of directors of both
Avid and M-Audio
have unanimously approved the definitive agreement. The
acquisition has received Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance and is expected to close before the end of August after the satisfaction of certain closing conditions
. The acquisition is expected to be recorded in Avid's third quarter,
subject to the completion of fair valuation analyses and the allocation of the purchase price.

A conference call to discuss the M-Audio acquisition will be held on Friday, August 13, at 8:00 a.m. EDT. The call will be open to the public. The conference call can be accessed from any U.S. or international location by dialing (719) 457-2649

ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. On August 12, 2004, Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Avid"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Avid, Maui Paradise Corporation, a California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avid (the "Merger Sub"), Maui LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avid (the "Merger LLC"), and Midiman, Inc., a California corporation doing business as M-Audio ("M-Audio"). The acquisition contemplated by the Merger Agreement was closed on August 20, 2004. As of the closing of the acquisition: - M-Audio became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avid; - Each share of M-Audio capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the transaction was cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Avid common stock in the amounts set forth in the Merger Agreement; - Each outstanding option to purchase shares of M-Audio capital stock was assumed by Avid and converted into an option to purchase shares of Avid common stock, plus a pro rata portion of the contingent earnout consideration, if any, described below; and - Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of M-Audio capital stock was cancelled. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing Avid paid approximately $80,000,000 in cash, issued approximately 2,000,000 shares of Avid common stock and assumed M-Audio's outstanding options, which became options to purchase approximately 345,000 shares of Avid common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $9.20 per share. Approximately 290,00 shares of the 2,000,000 shares issued at closing were placed in escrow until September 30, 2005 (subject to extension for pending claims) to secure the indemnification obligations of M-Audio's shareholders. Avid used its existing cash resources to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid at closing. As additional consideration, Avid is required to issue to M-Audio's former equity holders additional shares of Avid common stock valued at up to $20,000,000 and $25,000,000, respectively, contingent upon the M-Audio business achieving specified gross profit targets for the twelve months ending January 31, 2005 and for the fifteen months ending December 31, 2005. The value of shares of Avid common stock, if any, issued pursuant to these earnout provisions will be determined based on the average closing price of Avid's common stock during the 10 trading days ending two days prior to the date of issuance of such shares. All Avid shares issued in the acquisition will be registered for resale following the closing. Timothy Ryan, M-Audio's founder, Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder, received approximately 1,500,000 shares (including shares placed in escrow) of Avid common
stock at closing, representing approximately 4.4% of Avid's outstanding shares, and has agreed not to sell these shares any faster than one-half within the first 90 days after the closing, one-sixth beginning 91 days after the closing and the remainder beginning one year after the closing. Mr. Ryan will also be eligible to receive up to approximately 650,000 shares of Avid common stock (based on the current market price) under the earnout provisions. At the closing, Mr. Ryan became general manager of M-Audio, reporting to the general manager of Avid's Digidesign division. M-Audio is a leading provider of digital audio and MIDI solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals. Avid currently intends to continue to use the tangible assets of M-Audio in the same manner in which they were used by M-Audio immediately prior to the acquisition. The terms of the Merger Agreement were determined on the basis of arms-length negotiations. Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, none of Avid, any of its affiliates, any director or officer of Avid or any associate of any such director or officer, had any material relationship with M-Audio or Mr. Ryan. For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the acquisition shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The terms of the transaction are more fully described in the Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by this reference. ITEM 7.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "AGREEMENT") is entered into as of August 12, 2004 by and among Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "BUYER"), Maui Paradise Corporation, a California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY"), Maui LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "BUYER LLC"), and Midiman, Inc., a California corporation doing business as M-Audio (the "COMPANY"). This Agreement contemplates a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "MERGER"), pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company will receive cash and common stock of the Buyer in exchange for their shares of capital stock of the Company. The Merger then shall be followed, as soon as reasonably practicable, by a merger of the Surviving Corporation with and into the Buyer LLC (the "FINAL MERGER"). It is the intention of the Parties that the Merger be mutually interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Final Merger and that the Final Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by Section 4.11, be effected, as soon as reasonably practicable, following the Effective Time and without the further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the Parties or the Buyer LLC. It is the further intention of the Parties that, upon consummation of the Merger and the Final Merger, there will be achieved a single end result and the shareholders of the Company at the Effective Time will receive the same economic benefit and/or ownership interest in the Buyer as such shareholders of the Company would have received had the Company been merged directly with and into the Buyer LLC. The Parties intend that the Merger and the Final Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Certain defined terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article IX hereof. Now, therefore, in consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows. ARTICLE I THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1107 of the California General Corporation Law.
1.2 THE CLOSING. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in Boston, Massachusetts, commencing at 1:00 p.m., Boston time, on the Closing Date. 1.3 ACTIONS AT THE CLOSING. At the Closing: (a) the Company shall deliver to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 5.2; (b) the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 5.3; (c) the Surviving Corporation shall file the Merger Filings with the Secretary of State of the State of California; (d) the Buyer shall deliver the cash component of the Initial Per Share Consideration and certificates for the shares of Buyer Common Stock included in the Initial Per Share Consideration to the Company Shareholders that deliver Certificates at the Closing in accordance with Section 1.7 (provided that Buyer shall retain in trust for the benefit of holders of Certificates any Initial Per Share Consideration payable with respect to Certificates that are not properly surrendered at the Closing and shall not be obligated to pay any cash or shares of Buyer Common Stock deliverable with respect to such Certificates until such Certificates are properly surrendered pursuant to Section 1.7); (e) the Buyer, the Indemnification Representatives and the Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreements and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Merger Consideration being placed in escrow on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.11; and (f) the Company shall deliver to the Buyer true and correct schedules of all Transaction Expenses and the amounts of any filing fees paid under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. 1.4 ADDITIONAL ACTION. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the Transitory Subsidiary, necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any of the following securities: (a) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive (subject to the provisions of Section 1.5(e) and Section 1.11) the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Common Share as described in Section 1.10. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the cash portion of the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration shall be reduced and (ii) the 2
Buyer Common Stock portion of the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration shall be increased, in each case by the same amount, with the additional Buyer Common Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock Value, to the extent necessary to satisfy the Stock Consideration Requirement (which measurement of Stock Consideration Requirement shall be made in accordance with the definition thereof). (b) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive (subject to the provisions of Section 1.5(e) and Section 1.11) the Per Share Preferred Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Preferred Share as described in Section 1.10. (c) Subject to Section 1.15, each holder of Common Shares shall receive the Initial Per Share Upfront Common Consideration deliverable with respect to such Common Shares by the Buyer's delivery of (i) such holder's pro rata share of the Upfront Common Cash Consideration based on the number of Common Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time as a percentage of the total Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the balance of the Initial Per Share Upfront Common Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock Value. (d) Subject to Section 1.15, each holder of Preferred Shares shall receive the Initial Per Share Preferred Consideration deliverable with respect to such Preferred Shares by the Buyer's delivery of (i) such holder's pro rata share of the Upfront Preferred Cash Consideration based on the number of Preferred Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time as a percentage of the total Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the balance of the Initial Per Share Preferred Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock Value. (e) The "UPFRONT MERGER CONSIDERATION" shall consist of the Upfront Common Consideration payable to the Common Shareholders upon conversion of the Common Shares and the Total Preferred Consideration payable to the Preferred Shareholders upon conversion of the Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and Section 1.5(b) above. The "ESCROW MERGER CONSIDERATION" shall consist of (i) shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of $11,250,000 (the "GENERAL ESCROW MERGER CONSIDERATION"), of which shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of $3,136,500 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger Consideration payable to holders of Preferred Shares (the "PREFERRED GENERAL ESCROW CONTRIBUTION") and shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of $8,113,500 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the Common Shares (the "COMMON GENERAL ESCROW CONTRIBUTION"); and (ii) additional shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of $2,650,000 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the Common Shares (the "TAX ESCROW MERGER CONSIDERATION"). The Common General Escrow Consideration shall be withheld from the Common Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount of the Upfront Common Consideration to be received by each such Common Shareholder as a percentage of the total 4
Upfront Common Consideration to be received by all Common Shareholders. The Preferred General Escrow Contribution shall be withheld from the Preferred Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount of the Total Preferred Consideration to be received by each such holder of Preferred Shares as a percentage of the Total Preferred Consideration. The Tax Escrow Merger Consideration shall be withheld from the Upfront Common Consideration to be received by the Common Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount of Upfront Common Consideration to be received by each such holder as a percentage of the total Upfront Common Consideration to be received by all such Common Shareholders. The Escrow Merger Consideration shall be deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 1.11 and each Escrow Agreement shall provide for the establishment of sub escrow accounts for each Company Shareholder participating in such Escrow Agreement, which sub escrow account shall be based upon the pro rata percentage of each participant's initial interest in the applicable Escrow Merger Consideration (the "SUB ESCROW ACCOUNTS"). The Escrow Merger Consideration shall be held and disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements. In the event some or all of the Escrow Merger Consideration is sold pursuant to the Escrow Agreements, all references herein to Escrow Merger Consideration shall mean and include the replacement cash proceeds from sales of such Escrow Merger Consideration. Subject to the preceding sentence, each Indemnifying Shareholder shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to sell shares of Buyer Common Stock held pursuant to the Escrow Agreements in the manner and amounts as described in the Escrow Agreements. The holders of the Common Shares shall be entitled to receive the remaining Per Share Upfront Common Consideration into which each Common Share was converted pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "INITIAL PER SHARE UPFRONT COMMON CONSIDERATION") and the holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive the remaining Per Share Preferred Consideration into which such Preferred Share was converted pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "INITIAL PER SHARE PREFERRED CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Initial Per Share Upfront Common Consideration, shall be referred to as the "INITIAL PER SHARE CONSIDERATION"). (f) Each share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 4
1.6 DISSENTING SHARES. (a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive, in the case of Common Shares, the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Common Share and, in the case of Preferred Shares, the Per Share Preferred Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Preferred Share, unless such Company Shareholder's right to appraisal shall have ceased in accordance with Section 1309 of the California General Corporation Law. If such Company Shareholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, in the case of Common Shares, the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Common Share and, in the case of Preferred Shares, the Per Share Preferred Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Preferred Share, and (ii) following the occurrence of such event, upon proper surrender of the Certificate in accordance with Section 1.7 the Buyer shall deliver to such Company Shareholder the Initial Per Share Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5. (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the California General Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 1.7 EXCHANGE OF SHARES. (a) If any Certificates are not delivered at the Closing, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and not later than five business days following the Closing the Buyer shall send a notice and a transmittal form to each holder of any Certificate that was not delivered at the Closing, advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering such Certificate in exchange for the Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5. Each holder of a Certificate, upon proper surrender thereof to the Buyer at the Closing or in accordance with the instructions in such notice, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to any Taxes required to be withheld) the applicable Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5 for each Company Share evidenced thereby. Until properly surrendered, each such Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the applicable Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5 for each Company Share evidenced thereby. Holders of Certificates shall not be entitled to receive the Initial Per Share Consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled until such Certificates are properly surrendered. (b) If any Initial Per Share Consideration is to be delivered to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it 5
shall be a condition to the delivery of the Initial Per Share Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person requesting such transfer shall pay to the Buyer any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5 that are delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Buyer shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable in exchange therefor pursuant to Section 1.5. The Buyer may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the Buyer a bond in such sum as it may direct (not to exceed the amount of the Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Buyer with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. (d) No dividends or other distributions that are payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as of a date on or after the Closing Date shall be paid to former Company Shareholders entitled by reason of the Merger to receive Initial Per Share Consideration until such holders surrender their Certificates for the Initial Per Share Consideration. Upon such surrender, the Buyer shall pay or deliver to the persons in whose name the certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock are issued any dividends or other distributions that are payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as of a date on or after the Closing Date and which were paid or delivered between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender; provided that no such person shall be entitled to receive any interest on such dividends or other distributions. 1.8 FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued to former Company Shareholders upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such persons shall not be entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to such persons. In lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued, each person that would have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock shall, upon proper surrender of such person's Certificates, receive a cash payment equal to the Buyer Common Stock Value of such fractional share of Buyer Common Stock. 1.9 OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. (a) As of the Effective Time, the Buyer will assume the Option Plan and all then outstanding Options and agreements pursuant to the Option Plan. 6
(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number). In addition, the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to each such Option shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(iii), and if such Option is exercised prior to the Earnout Distribution Date the holder of such Option shall receive the right to receive distributions, if any, pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(ii). The exercise price per share of each such assumed Option shall be equal to the exercise price of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). All other terms and conditions of the Options (including the term, exercisability and vesting schedule of the Options) shall remain unchanged. (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders" rights pursuant to such Options, as amended by this Section 1.9, and the agreements evidencing such Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the amendments provided for in this Section 1.9 and such notice). (d) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of any Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.9. The Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act with the SEC with respect to all shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Options that may be registered on a Form S-8 within the later of (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing and (ii) 15 calendar days after the delivery of all required information from the Company (including without limitation all required financial statements). The Buyer shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such Options remain outstanding. (e) The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent from each holder of an Option to the amendment of such Option pursuant to this Section 1.9 (unless such consent is not required under the terms of the applicable agreement, instrument or plan). (f) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver amendments to each outstanding Warrant, in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A, providing that (i) such Warrants shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, (ii) the holders of such Warrants shall have no further rights thereto after the Effective Time and (iii) such Warrants shall not be exercised prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. (g) As of the Effective Time, all repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to Common Shares that constitute unvested shares of restricted stock shall be assigned to the Buyer and shall continue in full force and effect. 7
1.10 EARNOUT CONSIDERATION. (a) The Common Shareholders and holders of Options (to the extent such Options are outstanding as of the applicable Earnout Distribution Date or have been exercised prior to the applicable Earnout Distribution Date) (collectively, the "COMMON EARNOUT HOLDERS") shall be entitled to additional consideration and the Preferred Shareholders shall be entitled to additional consideration (the "EARNOUT CONSIDERATION") as follows: (i) FIRST EARNOUT. 1.

(iii) The Earnout Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 1.10(e), or (y) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties. (iv) The fees and expenses of the Earnout Arbitrator in connection with the resolutions of disputes pursuant to this Section 1.10(e) shall be shared equally by the Earnout Holders on the one hand and the Buyer on the other hand, provided that, if the Earnout Arbitrator determines that one party has adopted a position(s) that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Earnout Arbitrator may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of such fees and expenses to such party. (v) Within 15 days of the resolution of any dispute, the Buyer shall make any additional payment of Earnout Consideration determined by the Earnout Arbitrator. (f) The Buyer shall deliver the Earnout Consideration to the Earnout Holders as follows: 10
(i) The holder of each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares) shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date as is obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Earnout Consideration distributable to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio by (y) the Earnout Equivalents on such Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section 1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v), Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(i) shall be paid by the Buyer by delivery to the Common Shareholders of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the name of each Common Shareholder having an Earnout Value equal to the Earnout Consideration payable to each such Common Shareholder on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date. (ii) For each share of Buyer Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an Option during the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date (not including with respect to the Second Earnout Distribution Date (A) any shares of Buyer Common Stock delivered pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(ii) on the First Earnout Distribution Date or (B) any shares of Buyer Common Stock issued as a result of an increase pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(iii) on the First Earnout Distribution Date in the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option), the Earnout Holder that initially acquired such share of Common Stock shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date as is obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date by (y) the Earnout Equivalents as of such Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section 1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v), Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(ii) shall be paid by the Buyer by delivery to Common Earnout Holders of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the name of each Common Earnout Holder having an Earnout Value equal to the Earnout Consideration payable to each such Common Earnout Holder on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date. (iii) For each share of Buyer Common Stock subject to an Option that is outstanding as of an Earnout Distribution Date (not including with respect to the Second Earnout Distribution Date any shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable as a result of an increase pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(iii) on the First Earnout Distribution Date in the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option), the Common Earnout Holder, upon exercise of such Option, shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date as is obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date by (y) the Earnout Equivalents as of such Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section 1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v), Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(iii) shall be paid by increasing the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such outstanding Option by a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the portion of the Earnout Consideration payable to the Common Earnout Holders on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date with respect to all shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option divided by the Earnout Value as of the applicable Earnout Distribution Date. 11
(iv) The Preferred Shareholders shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Preferred Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.10(a), if any, on a pro rata basis based on the number Preferred Shares held by each such Preferred Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time. Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(iv) shall be paid by the Buyer by delivery to the Preferred Shareholders of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the name of each Preferred Shareholder having an Earnout Value equal to the Earnout Consideration payable to each such Preferred Shareholder on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date. (v) The right to receive a portion of the Earnout Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall be nontransferable, except by operation of law. For avoidance of doubt, the right to receive the Earnout Consideration hereunder shall remain with the Earnout Holders and shall not be affected by the sale or transfer of any Buyer Common Stock by the Earnout Holders following the Effective Time. (vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the distribution of Earnout Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.10(f) would cause the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement (including for this purpose all shares of Buyer Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to Options outstanding at the time of such distribution) to exceed 6,200,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Buyer may substitute cash for those shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issuable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f), but only to the extent that such shares, when combined with the other shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable under this Agreement, exceed 6,200,000 shares; provided, however, any such substituted cash shall not be paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall have no further obligation with respect to the cash the Buyer would have substituted pursuant to this Section 1.5(f)(vi), to the extent such substitution would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to fail to satisfy the Stock Consideration Requirement or in the alternative, any such lower stock consideration requirement that Dorsey & Whitney LLP opines to the Earnout Representatives will not adversely impact the tax opinion issued by Dorsey & Whitney LLP under Section 5.3(h). (g) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued to Earnout Holders, and such Earnout Holders shall not be entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to such Earnout Holders. In lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued, each Earnout Holder that would have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive a cash payment equal to the Earnout Value of the fractional share of Buyer Common Stock that such Earnout Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. (h) In the event of a Change in Control of the Buyer prior to the expiration of the Second Earnout Period, then immediately prior to such Change in Control (but subject to the consummation of such Change in Control) the Earnout Holders shall be entitled to receive, in accordance with Section 1.10(f), Earnout Consideration of $45,000,000 less any amounts previously paid pursuant to this Section 1.10 regardless of the Gross Profits of the Business Unit, 12
as if each Earnout Distribution Date occurred on the date of the consummation of the Change in Control. (i) The Company agrees and acknowledges that the Buyer may make from time to time such business decisions as it deems appropriate in the conduct of the Business Unit's business, including actions that may have an impact on the Gross Profits of the Business Unit, and the Earnout Holders will have no right to claim any lost Earnout Consideration or other damages as a result of such decisions so long as the actions were taken in good faith by the Buyer and were not taken by the Buyer for the purpose of avoiding or frustrating the provisions of this Section 1.10. (j) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer may elect to retain up to the Set-Off Amount from the amounts payable, if any, to Common Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.10 to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders (other than the former holders of the Preferred Shares) as provided in Section 6.1 below. (k) All issuances of Earnout Consideration to a particular Earnout Holder shall be subject to the expiration or termination of all waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act applicable to such Earnout Holder's acquisition of the Earnout Consideration. (l) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the earnout arrangements specified in this Section 1.10, including the right of the Buyer to retain up to the Set-Off Amount to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders as provided herein and the appointment and authority of the Earnout Representatives. 1.11 ESCROW. (a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the General Escrow Merger Consideration and the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5, for the purpose of securing the applicable indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders set forth in this Agreement. The General Escrow Merger Consideration and the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the General Escrow Agreement and the Tax Escrow Agreement, respectively, pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Merger Consideration shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements. (b) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreements and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Escrow Merger Consideration in escrow and the appointment and authority of the Indemnification Representatives. 13
(c) Notwithstanding the initial allocation in accordance with Section 1.5(e), the Indemnification Representatives shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to reallocate the amounts held under the General Escrow Agreement and the Tax Escrow Agreement in accordance with that certain letter agreement dated August 12, 2004 between Timothy D. Ryan, Thomas A. Turner, Summit Partners, L.P. and the other parties named therein, and the Preferred Shareholders and Common Shareholders shall be bound by any determination by the Indemnification Representatives in this regard; provided that such agreement shall not in any manner reduce, delay or impair any distributions to the Buyer from the General Escrow Agreement or the Tax Escrow Agreement pursuant to Article VI hereof. The determination of the Indemnification Representatives regarding any such reallocation shall be binding and non-appealable with respect to the Common Shareholders and the Preferred Shareholders. 1.12 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer LLC shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be made under the Escrow Agreements) if such withholding is required by law and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Company Shareholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Company Shareholder or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 14

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company supplemental information concerning events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof which would render any representation or warranty in this Agreement inaccurate or incomplete at any time after the date of this Agreement until the Closing.

Unless the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof by reason of such supplemental information (when taken together with any other such supplemental information provided from the date hereof through and including such date), and exercises that right within the period of three business days after notice is given pursuant to the paragraph above, the supplemental information delivered pursuant hereto will be deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedule and to have qualified the representations and warranties contained in Article III above for the purposes of satisfying the conditions to Closing in Article V. 4.7 EXCLUSIVITY.

As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but at least one business day after the business day of the Effective Time and in no event later than the close of business on the fifteenth business day immediately following the business day of the Effective Time (unless additional time is reasonably required to effect an orderly transition of the payroll and benefit plans of the Company to the Buyer, in which event no later than the close of business on the thirtieth calendar day immediately following the calendar day of the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into the Buyer LLC. From and after the effectiveness of the Final Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease and the Buyer LLC shall continue as the surviving entity in the Final Merger. The Buyer and the Buyer LLC shall take all such steps and actions as shall be required to cause the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer LLC to consummate the Final Merger as set forth in this Section 4.11. 4.12 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. All Company employees retained by the Buyer after the Closing Date (the "RETAINED EMPLOYEES") shall be entitled to receive compensation and benefits that initially are comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits offered to other similarly situated employees of the Buyer, provided that the Buyer retains the right to adjust such compensation and benefits following the Closing in its business judgment and the right to terminate any Retained Employee. The Buyer shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their Reasonable Best Efforts to permit the Retained Employees to receive credit under their employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements for service performed for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (or a predecessor to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or assets to the extent credited by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) so that such service shall be treated as service with the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit levels where length of services is relevant to benefit levels (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, benefit accrual under any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and any accrual that would result in any duplication of 43
benefits), subject to the application of any break-in-service rules under such plans, programs, arrangements and applicable law. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any payments made by a Retained Employee under a Company Plan that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits during the plan year of such Company Plan in which the Effective Time occurs to be taken into account under a corresponding plan maintained by the Buyer for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee for the applicable plan year as if such payments had been paid in accordance with such corresponding Buyer plan. 4.13 SECTION 280G COVENANT. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any and all payments from the Company contingent on the Merger (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(i) of the Code) that could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b) of the Code, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements for the small business exemption of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Such vote shall determine the "disqualified individual's" right to all such payments or other compensation from the Company. In addition, before the vote is submitted to stockholders, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Company Shareholders of all material facts concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder. 4.14 TAX MATTERS. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

No Party shall take any action, fail to take any action, cause any action to be taken or cause any action to fail to be taken that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger and the Final Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. 4.15 FIRPTA CERTIFICATION. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer either (i) a notice from the Company, also delivered to the Internal Revenue Service, that the Company Shares are not a "U.S. real property interest" in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 897 and 1445 of the Code, or (ii) certifications from all of the Company Shareholders that they are not "foreign persons" in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the Code. If the Buyer does not receive either the notice or certifications described above on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be permitted to 44
withhold from the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Per Share Preferred Consideration, as applicable, any required withholding tax under Section 1445 of the Code. 4.16 TERMINATION OF 401(k) PLAN. At least two days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt a resolution or obtain a written consent terminating its 401(k) plan effective as of the day preceding the Closing Date.

Rollover amounts contributed to the Buyer's 401(k) plan in accordance with this Section 4.16 shall at all times be 100% vested and shall be invested in accordance with the provisions of the Buyer's 401(k) plan. In the case of any employee of the Company, the Buyer's 401(k) plan will take into account, for eligibility and vesting purposes, such employee's service prior to the Closing Date that is creditable to such employee under the Company's 401(k) plan. The Buyer acknowledges and agree that the provisions of Section 6.1 shall not extend to any breach or alleged breach by the Company or the Subsidiaries of a representation or warranty or covenant to the extent that such breach arises out of the actions to be taken by the Company with respect to its 401(k) plan as required by this Section 4.16; and the Buyer and the Buyer LLC further agree to indemnify the Indemnifying Shareholders and the directors of the Company in respect of, and hold them harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnifying Shareholders or directors of the Company resulting from or relating to the actions to be taken by the Company with respect to its 401(k) plan as required by this Section 4.16. 4.17 TAX DELIVERABLES.

The Indemnification Representatives shall have the right to review and comment on any such Tax Return prepared by the Buyer (a draft of which shall be provided to the Indemnification Representatives not less than five business days prior to filing such Tax Return) to the extent the Indemnifying Shareholders would incur an indemnification liability thereunder.

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Third Party Action.

Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VI and (B) the AD DAMNUM is less than or equal to the amount of Damages for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article VI and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of Third Party Action involving criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party.

The Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.3(a) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Action; PROVIDED that, with respect to each of (i) and (ii) in the foregoing sentence, the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Party Action. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 51

(c) Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to an Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer such portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration as has an aggregate cash and Buyer Common Stock Value equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to an Escrow Agreements, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer such portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration as has an aggregate cash and Buyer Common Stock Value equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. All distributions of the Escrow Merger Consideration to the Buyer under this Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.3(d) shall consist of pro rata portions of each Sub Escrow Account in the applicable Escrow Agreement on deposit with the Escrow Agent based on the ratio that the number of Escrow Shares initially deposited in such Sub Escrow Account bore to the number of Escrow Shares initially deposited in all Sub Escrow Accounts under the applicable Escrow Agreement. (d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall submit the Dispute to binding arbitration. If the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is seeking to enforce the claim that is the subject of the Dispute pursuant to an Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration shall be distributed to the Buyer and/or the Indemnifying Shareholders (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute). (e) If, as set forth in Section 6.3(d), a Dispute is submitted to binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator (the "ARBITRATOR") in accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time to time and the following provisions: 52

Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to Section 10.11), provided that the Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to grant injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief. (v) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 6.3(e), or (y) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties. (vi) In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, except that the fees and costs of the AAA and the Arbitrator, the costs and expenses of obtaining the facility where the arbitration hearing is held, and such other costs and expenses as the Arbitrator may determine to be directly related to the conduct of the arbitration and appropriately borne jointly by the parties (which shall not include any party's attorneys' fees or costs, witness fees (if any), costs of investigation and similar expenses) shall be shared equally by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.3, if a third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified Party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may constitute or result in Damages for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, and such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation with the consent from the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (but with it being understood that the giving of such consent shall not prejudice the ability of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification with respect to such matter or in any manner operate as a presumption that the Indemnifying Party concurred that the amount at issue or paid was reasonable or appropriate), (ii) such Indemnified Party may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in 53
accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, for any such Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VI).

The Indemnification Representatives may only take action by unanimous consent and shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Indemnifying Shareholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the Indemnifying Shareholders under this Article VI. The Indemnification Representatives shall have no liability to any Indemnifying Shareholder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Indemnifying Shareholders pursuant to this Article VI. (h) With respect to each Tax Matter for which there is a Final Determination, within three days following such Final Determination, the Buyer and the Indemnification Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties (A) if a notice is not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or Section 6.3(d), instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer such portion of the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration as has an aggregate value equal to the Damages, if any, relating to such Tax Matter and (B) instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Indemnifying Shareholders, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration remaining in escrow after the distribution to the Buyer of the Damages related to such Tax Matter exceeds (ii) $500,000 plus the aggregate Tax Escrow Merger Consideration reserved, as set forth on Schedule 6.1(f), with respect to the Tax Matters for which there has not been a Final Determination as of such date. For the purpose of this Section 6.3(h), "Final Determination" shall mean the first to occur of: 1. any written notice from or agreement with the appropriate Governmental Entity resolving the particular Tax Matter; 2. a decision, judgment, decree, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to further judicial review (by appeal or otherwise) and has become final; 3. the execution of a closing agreement under Section 7121 of the Code or the acceptance by the IRS or its counsel of an offer in compromise under Section 7122 of the Code, or comparable agreements under the laws of other jurisdictions; 4. any other final disposition of the Tax liability for such period by reason of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; or 54
5. any other event that the Buyer and the Indemnification Representative agree in writing is a final and irrevocable determination of the liability at issue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no Final Determination has been made with respect to the Tax Matter set forth in Schedule 6.1(f)(2), on April 30, 2006, the amount reserved for such Tax Matter shall be reduced to $175,000 and the Indemnification Representatives shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Indemnifying Shareholders, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration remaining in escrow (as such reserves may have been adjusted) exceeds (ii) $500,000 plus the aggregate Tax Escrow Merger Consideration reserved, as set forth on Schedule 6.1(f) (as such reserves may have been adjusted), with respect to the Tax Matters for which there has not been a Final Determination as of such date. 6.4 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties that are covered by the indemnification obligations in Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.2(a) shall (a) survive the Closing and (b) shall expire on September 30, 2005 (it being understood that the Buyer may recover from the Set-Off Amount on or before March 31, 2006, but only in the event a Claim Notice is given on or before September 30, 2005), except that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3.2 and 3.3 shall survive the Closing without limitation, and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.9 shall survive until 90 days following expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (as such periods may be extended by regulatory or other enforcement action). If, and only if, an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty, or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty, then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party; and if the Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent and Escrow Merger Consideration has been retained in escrow after the applicable Termination Date (as defined in the applicable Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Expected Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such retained Escrow Merger Consideration to the Indemnifying Shareholders in accordance with the terms of such Escrow Agreement. The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VI shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by an Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date (including through supplements to the Disclosure Schedule permitted by Section 4.6), with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of indemnification hereunder or (ii) any waiver by an Indemnified Party of any closing condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants. 6.5 LIMITATIONS. 55

However, the rights of the Buyer under Section 6.1(a) relating to a breach of the representations set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.9, and under Sections 6.1(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall not be limited to the Escrow Merger Consideration and the Set-Off Amount nor shall the Escrow Agreements and the Set-Off Amount be the exclusive means for the Buyer to enforce such rights and instead the aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Shareholders for Damages with respect to such matters shall not exceed an amount equal to 100% of the Total Merger Consideration received by such Indemnifying Shareholder; provided that (i) the Buyer shall not attempt to collect any Damages directly from the Indemnifying Shareholders except to the extent that the General Escrow Merger Consideration held in escrow pursuant to the General Escrow Agreement is less than such Damages and (ii) the Buyer shall not 57
attempt to collect any Damages pursuant to Section 6.1(f) from the Escrow Merger Consideration held in escrow pursuant to the General Escrow Agreement or the Set-Off Amount except to the extent that the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration held in escrow pursuant to the Tax Escrow Agreement is less than such Damages.

Any notice shall contain any material factual information (to the extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability and shall be accompanied by any written notice or other document received from the applicable taxing authority with respect to such matter. No failure 58
or delay in informing the other party shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Indemnifying Shareholders or Buyer hereunder, except to the extent such failure or delay shall have adversely affected the indemnifying party's ability to defend against any liability or claim with respect to Taxes for which such party may be liable hereunder. The Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax Audit, initiate any other claim for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against any other assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to Taxes with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries; provided that, with respect to any item the adjustment of which may cause the Indemnifying Shareholders to become obligated to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement, the Buyer shall consult with the Indemnification Representatives with respect to the Tax Audit and the proposed adjustment and shall provide the Indemnification Representatives with copies of all correspondence sent or received by the Buyer with respect thereto, and the Buyer shall not unreasonably to the disadvantage of Indemnifying Shareholders settle or resolve any such item. 6.7 TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2002, 2003 AND 2004
 
1.         THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
Midiman, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") designs, markets and distributes professional quality audio products for the music industry. Products are primarily sourced from contract manufacturers in Taiwan and are sold through retail dealers in the United States ("U.S.") and foreign countries from locations in Southern California, England, Germany, Canada and Japan.
Description of Business
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis of Presentation
 
The financial position and results of operations of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in operations as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Use of Estimates
 
In January 2003, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to authorize 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 4,106,824 shares of preferred stock and effected a 2,000-for-1 stock split. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Stock Split
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current period presentation.
Reclassifications
 
2.         SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company maintains cash balances at individual institutions in excess of $100,000, which is the federally insured limit, should the bank become insolvent. Amounts in excess of insured limits were $2,495,200 at January 31, 2004. In addition, the Company had $1,687,182 in accounts with foreign banks at January 31, 2003.
 
The fair values of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate carrying values due to their short maturities. The fair value of the Company's debt instruments approximates their carrying values based on rates currently available to the Company.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company invests primarily in money market funds and high-quality commercial paper instruments. Cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality institutions, the composition and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. The Company's trade accounts receivable are primarily derived from sales to large retailers. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally requires no collateral. The Company believes that the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is moderated by the Company's credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the high level of creditworthiness of its customers.
Concentrations
 
The Company has a concentration of sales and accounts receivable with one customer. For the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the sales to this customer amounted to 20%, 21% and 21%, respectively, of the Company's net sales. As of January 31, 2003 and 2004, accounts receivable from this customer amounted to 17% and 15%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. A significant reduction in sales to, or the inability to collect receivables from, this customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
The Company also has a concentration of purchases of inventory with one vendor. For the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, purchases from this vendor, as a percentage of total purchases, were 26%, 19% and 18%, respectively. While the Company believes alternative vendors could be utilized, any inability to obtain components or products in the amounts needed on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices could result in delays in product introductions, interruption in product shipments or increases in product costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company maintains allowances for estimated obsolete and excess inventories based upon projected sales levels.
Inventories
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term.
Property and Equipment
 
The Company evaluates long-lived assets held and used by the Company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.
 
Goodwill and intangible assets consist primarily of assets resulting from the purchase of Evolution Electronics, Ltd. in July 2003 (see Note 3). Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, , acquired intangible assets must be separately identified. Acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their individual useful lives and are evaluated for impairment pursuant to the same methodology as other long-lived assets, described above. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the entire Company to the carrying value of the underlying net assets. If the fair value of the Company is determined to be less than the fair value of the net assets, goodwill may be impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the Company and the fair value of all other assets and liabilities.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
The Company recognizes revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, these conditions are typically met upon shipment and transfer of title for customers with FOB shipping point terms and upon receipt for customers with FOB destination terms.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,
 
The Company also distributes music-related software products in the United States for two foreign-based developers. Such software products are "off-the-shelf" products that do not require modification or customization, and the Company has no obligations subsequent to shipment of the software to resellers. Software revenue is recognized in accordance with the Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, , as amended, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to seller is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. The Company recognizes revenues from sales of its software as product is shipped and title passes, assuming the other criteria of SOP 97-2 are met.
Software Revenue Recognition
 
Customers have no legal right of return, except in the event of shipping errors or defective goods. However, in some instances, the Company has allowed returns or exchanges for other products. Estimated returns are provided for at the time of sale based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. While such returns have historically been within management's expectations, a significant change in return rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
The Company's products are offered for sale with warranties generally ranging from one to three years. As the Company has outsourced production to third-party manufacturers, warranty costs have historically been covered by such third parties. Thus, the Company has not incurred significant warranty-related costs for any years presented.
Warranties
 
Freight charges incurred by the Company in shipping its products to customers amounted to $347,871, $560,493 and $812,331 for the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and are included in selling and marketing expenses.
Freight Charges
 
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects, calculated at currently effective tax rates, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the consolidated financial statements. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Income Taxes
Accounting for Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of SFAS No. 123, The Company accounts for equity issuance to non-employees in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18,

The stock-based compensation expense of $345,000 can be allocated to operating expenses as follows: research and development, $52,000; general and administrative, $272,000; and selling and marketing, $21,000.
 
The following table illustrates the effect on net income as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The estimated fair value of each Company stock option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the years ended January 31. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the estimated weighted-average fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ending January 31, 2003 and 2004 were $0.20 per share and $2.78 per share, respectively. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based awards to employees been determined based on the estimated fair value at the grant dates consistent with the fair value method of SFAS No. 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the Company's net income for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2003 and 2004 would have approximated the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands):

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 45, . FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 45 as of January 31, 2003 and has included the required disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The recognition provisions of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the estimated fair value of guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 was insignificant.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
 
FIN 46R, , was originally issued in January 2003 and subsequently revised in December 2003. FIN 46, as revised requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities in which a company has a significant interest, regardless of whether consolidation is required. Application of FIN 46 is required for potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application of the provisions will be required for all other variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company currently has no variable interest entities; therefore, the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
an interpretation of ARB No. 51
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope, which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. Also, mandatorily redeemable financial instruments are subject to the provisions of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after December 31, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3.         BUSINESS ACQUISITION
 
On July 31, 2003, the Company completed a stock purchase acquisition of Evolution Electronics, Ltd. ("Evolution"), a U.K.-based producer of electronic keyboards. This strategic acquisition provides the Company with a class compliant line of high-quality, affordable keyboards and MIDI controllers with strong brand recognition in the United Kingdom and Europe. The purchase price for Evolution was $4,341,053, consisting of cash of $3,116,964, 261,200 common shares with an estimated fair value of $1,095,578 and direct acquisition costs of $128,511. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the excess being ascribed to goodwill.
Business Combinations,

6.         LINE OF CREDIT
 
Effective May 29, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for a line of credit facility. As of January 31, 2004, maximum borrowings were $6,000,000, limited to the lesser of (a) $6,000,000, or (b) the sum of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 40% of eligible inventory (to a maximum of $2,000,000), plus advances to foreign affiliates (to a maximum of $500,000). Any borrowings are collateralized by a general first priority lien against all Company assets, both tangible and intangible, and the personal guarantee of the Company's majority stockholder. The personal guarantee was released in May 2004. Interest is payable monthly at the London InterBank Offered Rate, plus 1.75%. All outstanding amounts on the line of credit were repaid in February 2003. This line of credit expires in November 2004.
 
The facility contains certain restrictions and covenants that require the Company to maintain certain levels of effective tangible net worth, meet certain minimum financial ratios (debt to net worth and quick ratio) and achieve minimum annual profitability. As a result of the loss on derivative related to the preferred stock (Note 11), the Company violated certain covenants. The Company received waivers for such requirements as of January 31, 2004 and is in the process of renegotiating the covenants on a go forward basis. As a result, no amounts are currently available for borrowing under the credit facility.

Litigation
 
During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sales and/or license of Company products; (ii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company; (iii) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts; (iv) indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of California; and (v) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company's use of the applicable premises. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Other Contingent Obligations

PREFERRED STOCK
 
On February 6, 2003, the Company issued and sold 4,106,824 shares of convertible preferred stock to an investor group (the "Investors") for gross proceeds of $13,125,000, of which $3,500,000 was paid directly to the Company's existing stockholders and $9,550,000 represented proceeds to the Company, after direct offering costs of $75,000. In exchange for the $3,500,000 payment, the existing shareholders returned 1,095,000 shares of common stock to the Company which were converted into an equal number of Series A preferred shares and issued to the Investors as part of the total preferred share issuance. This transaction was accounted for similar to a repurchase and retirement of treasury stock. The Company also issued to the Investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 312,901 shares of common stock at an exercise price of approximately $3.20 per share, which warrants expire five years from the date of grant. The fair value of the warrants was estimated at $312,000 using the Black-Scholes model.
Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Stock")
 
The Series A stockholders are entitled to noncumulative dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends on common stock. Each share of Series A Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time after issuance, into one share of common stock. The conversion rate will be automatically adjusted for stock splits such that all of the Series A Stock will automatically convert into common stock at the closing of a public offering of the Company's common stock, with gross proceeds of at least $40,000,000 and a per share public offering price of at least $9.60 per share, or at the election of the holders of a majority of the Series A Stock. Holders of Series A Stock are entitled to a liquidation preference of $3.20 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, prior to any distribution of assets to holders of common stock. Holders of Series A Stock have full voting rights on an as-converted basis and are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors. In the event of a change in ownership, the holders of Series A Stock may require the Company to redeem all of the Series A shares then outstanding at the liquidation value.
 
In conjunction with the sale of Series A Stock, the Company entered into a Shareholders Agreement with the new Investors. The Shareholders Agreement provides for certain rights of first refusal for existing stockholders if other stockholders elect to sell or transfer their shares. The Shareholders Agreement also provides the Series A stockholders with a put arrangement that gives such holders the right to require the Company to repurchase, on a net cash basis, any outstanding preferred shares at a price equal to the greater of liquidation value or the fair market value of the shares on an as-converted basis. The put may only be exercised beginning in February 2010. The put right expires if the preferred shares are converted to common shares. As a result of the put option, the conversion right and put obligation have been accounted for as a derivative. Accordingly, its fair value was recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the initial value, estimated at $5,460,000 using a Trinomial model, recorded as an allocation of proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock. The carrying value of the derivative is adjusted to fair value at each reporting date, and changes in the fair value from the date of issuance have been included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement operations.
 
12.       STOCK OPTION PLAN
 
The Company has a 2002 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the "Plan") under which common stock or options to acquire common stock of the Company may be granted to employees and directors of and consultants to the Company. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and permits the issuance of up to 1,515,600 shares of the Company's common stock. Options granted under the Plan generally vest over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of January 31, 2004, 142,800 common shares were available for future option issuance or direct grants under the Plan.
 
A summary of activity in the Company's stock option plan is as follows:
 
 
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 31, 2004 (shares in thousands):
 
 
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 accounting to its employee stock-based compensation plans.
 
During fiscal 2003, the Company issued 1,179,600 options to employees. All options granted during this year had exercise prices that were equal to the fair value of the common stock as determined by the Board of Directors at the date of grant.
 
During fiscal 2004, the Company issued 373,200 options to employees. Due to the difference between the exercise price and estimated fair value of common stock,
$1,013,000 of deferred compensation expense was recorded that will be amortized to expense over the vesting period. During 2004, the Company recognized compensation expense of $115,000 related to these grants.
 
The following table summarizes information for options granted with exercise prices that differ from the estimated market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended January 31:

These statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not include all the information and note disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements but reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods and dates presented.
 
The Company's preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The most significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include accounts receivable and sales allowances and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
 
These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and notes thereto.

The Company also issued to the Investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 312,901 shares of common stock at an exercise price of approximately $3.20 per share, which warrants expire five years from the date of grant.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
FIN 46R, an interpretation of ARB No. 51, was originally issued in January 2003 and subsequently revised in December 2003. FIN 46, as revised requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities in which a company has a significant interest, regardless of whether consolidation is required. Application of FIN 46 is required for potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application of the provisions will be required for all other variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company currently has no variable interest entities, therefore, the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope, which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. Also, mandatory redeemable financial instruments are subject to the provisions of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after December 31, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The statements contained in this section may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based largely on management's expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Neither Avid nor Midiman undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements.
 
On August 20, 2004, Avid completed the acquisition of Midiman, Inc. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to this acquisition.  For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2003. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Midiman's is January 31.  Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 with Midiman's statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 with Midiman's statement of operations for the six-month period ended April 30, 2004.  For purposes of the balance sheet, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of June 30, 2004.  The pro forma balance sheet included herein combines Avid's balance sheet as of June 30, 2004 with Midiman's balance sheet as of April 30, 2004.
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of an acquired entity based on their fair values as of the consummation of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values includes Avid management's consideration of a valuation of Midiman's intangible assets prepared by an independent valuation specialist. The allocation included in this pro forma financial information was based on the balance sheet of Midiman as of April 30, 2004.  The actual purchase accounting allocation will be revised to reflect the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired entity that exist as of the date of the acquisition
.
 
As consideration for the acquisition, Avid paid $79.7 million in cash and issued 1,974,234 shares of common stock valued at approximately $84.3 million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Midiman.  Additionally, Avid granted to Midiman employees stock options to purchase up to approximately 345,000 shares of Avid common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.21, in exchange for outstanding Midiman options.  The market price used to value the Avid shares issued as partial consideration for Midiman and the Avid options issued in exchange for outstanding Midiman options was based on the 5 day average closing price of the stock during the period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced publicly.  The following represents a preliminary estimate of the purchase price for accounting purposes for the acquisition of Midiman (dollar amounts are in thousands, except for per share amounts):
 
 
The fair value of Avid stock options exchanged for outstanding Midiman options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions and results:
 
 
The estimated purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of April 30, 2004.  Independent valuation specialists assisted management of Avid in determining the fair values of the intangible assets. Recording the identifiable intangible assets results in the establishment of a deferred tax liability of approximately $13.0 million, which is offset by the release in like amount of Avid's valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.  This allocation will be updated to reflect the fair value of the acquired net tangible assets as of the acquisition date (in thousands):
 
As part of the purchase agreement, Avid may be required to make additional payments to the former shareholders and option holders of Midiman of up to $45 million, contingent upon the operating results of the business acquired.  These payments, if required, will be made through issuance of additional Avid shares, and will be recorded as additional purchase price allocated to goodwill.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill resulting from the transaction is not amortized, but will be subject to an impairment test at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).  In the event that the goodwill becomes impaired, Avid will incur an impairment charge for the amount of impairment during the period in which the determination is made.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Midiman included in this document, and of Avid included in Avid's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and Avid's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid that would have been reported had the acquisition of Midiman been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid.  For example, going forward, Avid may incur integration related expenses not reflected in the pro forma financial information.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
 
On August 20, 2004, Avid completed the acquisition of Midiman.  For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2003. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Midiman's is January 31.  Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 with Midiman's statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 with Midiman's statement of operations for the six-month period ended April 30, 2004.  For purposes of the balance sheet, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of June 30, 2004.  The pro forma balance sheet included herein combines Avid's balance sheet as of June 30, 2004 with Midiman's balance sheet as of April 30, 2004.
 
(1)           Represents reclassifications to conform Midiman's accounting and reporting policies to Avid's accounting and reporting policies.
 
(2)           Represents the reversal of intangible amortization expense resulting from acquisitions consummated previously by Midiman.
 
(3)           Represents the reversal of stock compensation expense relating to stock options issued by Midiman.
 
(4)           Represents the amortization of intangible assets established as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of Midiman.  Intangible assets are being amortized based on management's current best approximation of the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the following number of years. Management will periodically review the determination.
 
 
 
(5)           Represents the reduction in investment income resulting from the reduced cash balance after payments to effect the acquisition of Midiman.
 
(6)           Represents the reversal of a loss associated with a put arrangement on preferred shares of Midiman, since the equity structure of Midiman has been replaced by the acquisition.
 
(7)           Adjusts the effective tax rate to that expected for the combined company.
 
(8)           The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the issuance of Avid stock, based upon an exchange ratio of 0.22202 of a share of Avid stock for each share of Midiman common stock, including Midiman's preferred stock on an as-if converted basis and a common stock warrant on an as-if exercised basis.  The average market price per share of Avid common stock of $42.72 was based on the 5 day average closing price of the stock during the period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced.
(9)           Represents the cash portion of consideration paid by Avid to acquire Midiman, including transaction costs estimated at $3.5 million.
 
(10)         Represents the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and the goodwill resulting from the purchase accounting.
 
(11)         Represent the reversal of Midiman's goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with previous acquisitions, which are inherently comprehended in the current fair values of intangible assets recorded in connection with Avid's acquisition of Midiman.
 
(12)         Represents the elimination of a conversion right and put option associated with Midiman's preferred stock prior to the acquisition, since the equity structure of Midiman has been replaced by the acquisition.
 
(13)         Represents the elimination of Midiman's historical redeemable preferred stock and equity accounts.
 
(14)         Represents the issuance of Avid common stock as consideration in the acquisition.
 
(15)         Represents deferred stock compensation associated with the intrinsic value of unvested stock options exchanged in the transaction.  The amount of deferred compensation was based on the portion of the intrinsic value of the Avid stock options issued that relates to the future vesting period.
 
(16)         Represents the amortization of deferred stock compensation expense for unvested stock options exchanged in the acquisition of Midiman by Avid.  The deferred compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the assumed options.  The amortization expense has been recorded in the expense category associated with the departmental classification of the grantee.
 
(17)         Represents the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities of Midiman based upon the offsetting effects of Avid's deferred tax assets.

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Reports Highest Ever Quarterly Revenue and Operating Profit Tewksbury, MA - October 26, 2004 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported the highest quarterly GAAP revenue and operating profit in the company's history. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004, were $147.4 million, a 24% increase over the $119.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2003. GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2004 was $18.3 million compared to $11.6 million for the same quarter in 2003. GAAP net income for the quarter was $19.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $11.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the corresponding quarter in 2003. Excluding a non-recurring tax benefit, acquisition-related stock-based compensation and amortization, and restructuring charges, pro forma non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $20.4 million, or $.58 per diluted share, compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $12.3 million, or $.37 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, were $414.6 million compared to revenues of $344.6 million for the same period in 2003. GAAP operating profit for the first nine months of 2004 was $48.6 million compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2003. GAAP net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, was $49.2 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $25.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003.

"This quarter, we posted a 24% year-over-year increase in revenue and a better-than 50% year-over-year increase in earnings per share, reflecting solid performance across the entire business," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "In video postproduction, we more than doubled our year-over-year sales of the Avid DS Nitris family of products, which underscores the strong demand for best-in-class HD tools for television and feature film production. In broadcast, we had our most successful quarter in terms of the total number of deals signed - bringing the total number of Avid digital broadcast conversions either under way or completed to more than 200 and keeping us on track to hit the high end of our target of 80-100 deals for 2004. Lastly, a strong performance in all areas of Digidesign's business, combined with the acquisition of M-Audio - the results of which are included in the last six weeks of the quarter - helped push our year-over-year revenue growth in audio to 60%."

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 2005 Bonus Plan --------------- On December 8, 2004, based upon a recommendation from the Compensation Committee of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Avid Technology, Inc. 2005 Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). All employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2005 and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must remain employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive their awards, if any. The Company may modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time at its sole discretion. The purpose of the Plan is to reward employees for achieving Company and "business unit" (as defined below) operating profit goals for 2005, as well as for individual performance and contributions. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company must achieve an operating profit above a specified level in order for any bonuses to be paid under the Plan. An individual participant's bonus payout under the Plan ("Bonus Payout") is based on three factors: the participant's "Target Award" (as defined below), the results of the participant's business unit ("Business Unit Performance"), and the participant's individual performance ("Individual Performance"). Algebraically, this can be represented as: Bonus Payout = Target Award X Business Unit Performance X Individual Performance Target Awards range from 5% to 140% of a participant's base salary, based on the organizational structure of the Company. For purposes of the Plan, all participants are grouped into three business units: corporate, audio and video. For each of the business units, Business Unit Performance is measured by revenue and operating profit. As a threshold matter, for all business units, 2005 revenues must be greater than 2004 revenues (adjusted for any acquisition made by the Company in 2004 as if such acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2004) for any Bonus Payouts to be made to participants in that business unit. Business Unit Performance is also measured by operating profit. Once a business unit meets an established minimum operating profit threshold ("Threshold Operating Profit"), participants in that business unit become eligible to receive a percentage of their Target Awards up to 100% if the target operating profit ("Target Operating Profit") is achieved, subject to their position within that business unit and further subject to their Individual Performance, each as described below. Specific Threshold and Target Operating Profits are set for each of the video and audio business units. The Threshold Operating Profit for the corporate business unit is the sum of the Threshold Operating Profits for the audio and video business units. Similarly, the Target Operating Profit for the corporate business unit is the sum of the Target Operating Profits of the Company's audio and video business units. If the corporate business unit exceeds its Target Operating Profit, for every $1.00 of incremental profit in excess of the corporate business unit's Target Operating Profit, an additional $0.15 is distributed among all participants whose business units exceeded their Target Operating Profits. 2
Business units are of further importance under the Plan for determining a given participant's Bonus Payout (subject to further adjustment for Individual Performance, as described below), as follows: (1) for executive officers and other corporate vice presidents, 100% of their Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of the corporate business unit; (2) for audio and video business unit vice presidents, 75% of their Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their business unit and the remaining 25% is based on corporate business unit results; and (3) for participants below the vice president level, 100% of their Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their business unit. Finally, there is an Individual Performance component to the Bonus Payout. Management (or in the case of the Company's executive officers, the Compensation Committee) may increase a participant's Bonus Payout by as much as 20% of such participant's bonus target amount or reduce it to zero, based upon its subjective evaluation of such participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company. Bonus Payouts under the Plan will be determined after financial results for 2005 are publicly released, which is currently anticipated to be in February 2006. Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be paid in February 2006. Board of Director Compensation ------------------------------ On December 8, 2004, based upon a recommendation from the Company's Compensation Committee, the Company's Board of Directors approved modifications to the annual cash compensation for non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Effective January 1, 2005, the annual cash compensation is as follows: o a $25,000 annual retainer for each non-employee director, o a $15,000 annual retainer for the Chair of the Board of Directors, o a $5,000 annual retainer for the Chair of each of the Audit, Nominating and Governance, and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors, o a payment of $1,500 to each member of the Board of Directors for each meeting attended, and o a payment of $1,500 to each member of the Audit, Nominating and Governance, and Compensation Committees for each meeting attended. The equity compensation that each non-employee member of the Board of Directors receives has not changed. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, on the date of the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors receives a non-qualified stock option grant to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, provided such Board member has served a minimum of six months on the Board of Directors. In addition, upon initial election to the Board of Directors, non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive a non-qualified stock option grant to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. 3

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Finishes 2004 with Record Quarter and Year Tewksbury, MA - February 3, 2005 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported record revenues of $175.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004 - a 37% increase over the $127.3 million generated in the corresponding quarter in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Avid reported record revenues of $589.6 million, up 25% from $471.9 million in 2003. This annual revenue growth rate is Avid's highest since 1995, the year it acquired Digidesign. "It's been a fantastic year across all of our major markets, with strong results in our video postproduction, broadcast, and audio businesses contributing to Avid's highest annual revenue growth rate in nine years," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "The postproduction industry, where our tools are already used by the lion's share of industry professionals, is undergoing a significant transition to HD. We experienced healthy demand for our new Media Composer(R) Adrenaline(TM) HD and Avid Xpress(R) Pro HD systems, which began shipping in December, and now offer HD capabilities across our entire Avid DNA(TM) product line. We also had a solid quarter in broadcast, finishing the year with over 100 deals signed, bringing the total number of Avid(R) digital broadcast conversions either under way or completed to more than 250. Lastly, our fourth quarter audio revenues grew by 70% year over year, with Digidesign successfully expanding its professional audio mixing business and entering the live sound market, and M-Audio delivering its first full quarter of results as a part of Avid in Q4." GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $20.1 million compared to $14.9 million for the same quarter in 2003. GAAP net income for the quarter was $22.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $15.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the corresponding quarter in 2003. Excluding non-recurring tax benefits, acquisition-related stock-based compensation and amortization, restructuring charges and a non-cash charge related to the impairment of intangible assets, pro forma non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $23.5 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $16.9 million, or $.50 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003.
GAAP operating profit for 2004 was $68.8 million, compared to $39.6 million in 2003. GAAP net income for 2004 was $71.7 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $40.9 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for 2003. Excluding non-recurring tax benefits, acquisition-related stock-based compensation and amortization, restructuring charges, expenses related to the settlement of a lawsuit and a non-cash charge related to the impairment of intangible assets, pro forma non-GAAP net income for 2004 was $74.9 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to $44.9 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2003. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The pro forma operating results listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We have included this information because we believe it is a meaningful measure of our normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis. This pro forma information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. We use this information internally to help our management more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our operations and measure our performance on a comparative basis.

No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock
 
.

If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Payment and any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Payment or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

The consolidated, unaudited balance sheet of the Buyer as of December 31, 2004 is referred to herein as the "Buyer Balance Sheet."
 
The information in the Registration Statement or in any Regulation M-A Filing (except, in each case, for information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or Regulation M-A Filing, as to which the Buyer makes no representation and which shall not constitute part of the Buyer SEC Reports for purposes of this Agreement), shall not at the time the Registration Statement or any Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, at any time the Registration Statement is amended or supplemented, or at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.

The Buyer maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information the Buyer is required to disclose in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Buyer's management as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Buyer has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the Buyer's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Buyer's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Buyer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
(d)
                                
 
that involves management or other employees of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the Buyer's internal control over financial reporting.  Since January 1, 2002, neither the Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Buyer, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Buyer or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Buyer's Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Buyer.
 
The Buyer is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the applicable listing and other rules and regulations of The Nasdaq National Market and has not since January 1, 2002 received any notice from The Nasdaq National Market asserting any non-compliance with such rules and regulations.  Each required form, report and document containing financial statements that the Buyer has filed with or submitted to the SEC since August 29, 2002 was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted by the Buyer's principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Buyer nor any of its affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) personal loans to any executive officer or director of the Buyer.

Absence of Certain Changes or Events
 
.  To the Buyer's knowledge, after consulting with its independent auditors and tax advisors, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code; provided that the Buyer shall not be in breach of this representation if the Merger fails to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code by reason of the Buyer's failing to acquire "control" of the Company for its voting stock as required by Section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Code.
4.6

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Avid Technology, Inc. to Acquire Pinnacle Systems, Inc.
 
Combination to provide Avid with immediate presence in consumer video and expand professional broadcast offerings
 
Tewksbury, MA, and Mountain View, CA
 March 21, 2005  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) and Pinnacle Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCLE) today announced that Avid has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pinnacle in a cash and stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive .0869 shares of Avid stock and $1.00 in cash for each Pinnacle share. At closing, it is expected that Avid will issue approximately 6.2 million shares and pay $71.3 million in cash, for a total estimated value of $462 million based on Avid's stock price of $62.95 at market close on Friday, March 18, 2005.  Upon completion of the transaction, the 6.2 million shares to be issued to Pinnacle's former shareholders will represent approximately 15% of Avid's outstanding common stock. The acquisition is subject to satisfying a number of closing conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2005.
 
The purchase price represents a 30% premium over Pinnacle's closing stock price of $4.97 on March 18, 2005. Assuming a closing date of July 1, 2005, Avid expects the transaction, excluding acquisition-related charges, to be dilutive to its pro-forma earnings per share in the third quarter and accretive in the fourth quarter, resulting in full-year 2005 pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.70 per diluted share. In 2006, Avid expects the transaction to be approximately 10 cents accretive, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.20 per diluted share. After payment of the cash portion of the purchase price, Avid expects its cash position to be $280-$300 million at the end of 2005.
 
Following the closing, the parties expect that Pinnacle's award-winning professional products  such as the MediaStream broadcast playout server and the Deko on-air graphics system  will enhance Avid's end-to-end broadcast production pipeline, which has helped Avid become a global leader in that industry. In addition, Pinnacle's consumer video business  which to date has shipped more than 10 million units 
 
will form the basis for a new consumer video division at Avid, providing the company with an immediate avenue into that segment.
 
Avid president and CEO David Krall said, "We see this acquisition as the next logical step in our long-term strategy.  Just as our acquisition of M-Audio in 2004 brought us into the consumer audio business, by acquiring Pinnacle's consumer video business, Avid will be able to tap into the next generation of video editors while they are still learning their craft. This creates a very large potential customer base for Avid's future. At the same time, we believe that Pinnacle's professional broadcast offerings will fit seamlessly with Avid's business, extending our end-to-end broadcast solutions with servers and on-air graphics products. We think it would be hard to find a more complementary match for these two businesses than what this combination provides."
 
Krall added: "As a result of this transaction, we expect to derive savings from a number of sources, including reducing public company expenses, combining infrastructure functions where appropriate, and providing our global sales teams with a broader portfolio of product offerings. Over the past five years, Avid has increased its profitability and shareholder value by growing our top line, expanding our gross margins, and leveraging our talent and technology across the entire company. By working with the dedicated team at Pinnacle, we're confident that, together, we can succeed with this same strategy following the completion of the transaction."
 
Pinnacle chairman and CEO Patti Hart said, "We
believe that this transaction creates significant value for our shareholders and provides excellent opportunities for continued growth for the combined company.  Avid has built a strong, well-deserved reputation for efficient business m
anagement while continuing to live up to its tradition of technological innovation in the video and audio industries. By bringing our own award-winning products to the table  including Pinnacle Studio, Pinnacle Liquid Edition, and our broad array of broadcast systems  we're confident that Pinnacle will strengthen and diversify Avid's business. Our customers can also anticipate a richer set of offerings within an organization that will be even better positioned moving ahead. We see this as the right move for Pinnacle, and we look forward to joining the Avid family."
 
The Boards of Directors of both Avid and Pinnacle have approved the definitive agreement.  Avid will seek stockholder approval of the transaction at its annual meeting, and Pinnacle will hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider approval of the transaction.  The dates of the shareholder meetings will be announced following completion of initial regulatory filings.
Conference Call
Avid and Pinnacle will hold a joint conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the transaction, including the estimated impact on Avid's future results. The joint conference call will take place on March 21 at 8:30 a.m., EST, and will be open to the public. The conference call can be accessed from any U.S. or international location by dialing (913) 981-5558 and referencing confirmation code 7229543. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on the Avid and Pinnacle Web sites.

Paul Milbury, Avid's chief financial officer, commented, "We are taking this unusual step of pre-announcing an estimate of our first quarter results in light of Pinnacle Systems, Inc.'s announcement on Wednesday of a lower-than-expected sales outlook for its quarter ended March 31, 2005."
 
Avid previously announced its agreement to acquire Pinnacle Systems on March 21, 2005.  The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2005, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
 
Avid will hold a conference call to review its first quarter results on Thursday, April 28, 2005, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, following the dissemination of its press release on those results
.
 
 
The call will also be available via live audio Webcast and subsequent replay on the company's Web site.  To listen via this alternative, go to the Investors page under the Company menu at www.avid.com.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The expected pro forma earnings per share listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  We have included this information because we believe it is a meaningful measure of our normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis.  This pro forma information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.  We use this information internally to help our management more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our operations and measure our performance on a comparative basis.
 
The above release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Avid's financial outlook for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.  There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results of operations to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as final GAAP closing entries for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the possibility that the acquisition will not close or that the closing will be delayed due to antitrust regulatory review or other factors, and the other factors set forth under the caption "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Avid's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and other filings with the SEC.  In addition, any forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date.  While Avid may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

MIDIMAN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2004 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of Midiman, Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of January 31, 2004 and July 31, 2004 the results of its operations and its cash flows for the six-month periods ended July 31, 2003 and 2004. These statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not include all the information and note disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements but reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods and dates presented. The Company's preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The most significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include accounts receivable and sales allowances, inventory valuation and income tax asset valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and notes thereto. 2. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company accounts for equity issuance to non-employees in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods and Services. The following table illustrates the effect on net income as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based awards to employees been determined based on the estimated fair value at the grant dates consistent with the fair value method of
SFAS No. 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the Company's net income would have approximated the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands): Six months ended July 31, 2003 2004 Net loss as reported ($6,618) ($18,799) Plus stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss-net of tax 8 266 Less stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method-net of tax (20) (285) ---------- ---------- Pro forma net loss ($6,630) ($18,818) 3. INVENTORIES Inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company maintains allowances for estimated obsolete and excess inventories based upon projected sales levels. 4. LINE OF CREDIT Effective May 29, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for a line of credit facility. As of July 31, 2004, maximum borrowings were $6,000,000, limited to the lesser of (a) $6,000,000, or (b) the sum of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 40% of eligible inventory (to a maximum of $2,000,000), plus advances to foreign affiliates (to a maximum of $500,000). Any borrowings are collateralized by a general first priority lien against all Company assets, both tangible and intangible, and the personal guarantee of the Company's majority stockholder. The personal guarantee was released in May 2004. Interest is payable monthly at LIBOR, plus 1.75%. All outstanding amounts on the line of credit were repaid in February 2003 and there have been no borrowings since that date. This line of credit expired in November 2004. The facility contains certain restrictions and covenants that require the Company to maintain certain levels of effective tangible net worth, meet certain minimum financial ratios (debt to net worth and quick ratio) and achieve minimum annual profitability. As a result of the loss on derivative related to the preferred stock (Note 7), the Company violated certain covenants. As a result, no amounts are currently available for borrowing under the credit facility. 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation--The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome of such matters is not determinable at the current time, the Company believes that none of its pending litigation matters, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Other Contingent Obligations--During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sales and/or license of Company products; (ii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company; (iii) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts; (iv) indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of California; and (v) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company's use of the applicable premises. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 6. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Total comprehensive income net of taxes consists of net income and net changes in foreign currency translation adjustment. The following is a summary of the Company's comprehensive income (loss), (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 31, ----------------------- 2003 2004 --------- --------- Net (loss) ($6,618) ($18,799) Net changes in: Foreign currency translation adjustment 29 (89) --------- --------- Total comprehensive (loss) ($6,589) ($18,888) ========= ========= 7. PREFERRED STOCK Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Stock")--On February 6, 2003, the Company issued and sold 4,106,824 shares of convertible preferred stock to an investor group (the "Investors") for gross proceeds of $13,125,000, of which $3,500,000 was paid directly to the Company's existing stockholders and $9,550,000 represented proceeds to the Company, after direct offering costs of $75,000. In exchange for the $3,500,000 payment, the existing shareholders returned 1,095,000 shares of common stock to the Company which were converted into an equal number of Series A preferred shares and issued to the Investors as part of the total preferred share issuance. This transaction was accounted for similar to a repurchase and retirement of treasury stock. The Company also issued to the
Investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 312,901 shares of common stock at an exercise price of approximately $3.20 per share, which warrants expire five years from the date of grant. The fair value of the warrants was estimated at $312,000 using the Black-Scholes model. The Series A stockholders are entitled to non-cumulative dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividends on common stock. Each share of Series A Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time after issuance, into one share of common stock. The conversion rate will be automatically adjusted for stock splits such that all of the Series A Stock will automatically convert into common stock at the closing of a public offering of the Company's common stock, with gross proceeds of at least $40,000,000 and a per share public offering price of at least $9.60 per share, or at the election of the holders of a majority of the Series A Stock. Holders of Series A Stock are entitled to a liquidation preference of $3.20 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, prior to any distribution of assets to holders of common stock. Holders of Series A Stock have full voting rights on an as-converted basis and are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors. In the event of a change in ownership, the holders of Series A Stock may require the Company to redeem all of the Series A shares then outstanding at the liquidation value. In conjunction with the sale of Series A Stock, the Company entered into a Shareholders Agreement with the new Investors. The Shareholders Agreement provides for certain rights of first refusal for existing stockholders if other stockholders elect to sell or transfer their shares. The Shareholders Agreement also provides the Series A stockholders with a put arrangement that gives such holders the right to require the Company to repurchase any outstanding preferred shares at a price equal to the greater of liquidation value or the fair market value of the shares on an as-converted basis. The put may only be exercised beginning in February 2010. The put right expires if the preferred shares are converted to common shares. As a result of the put option, the conversion right and put obligation have been accounted for as a derivative. Accordingly, its fair value was recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the initial value, estimated at $5,460,000 using a Trinomial model, recorded as an allocation of proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock. The carrying value of the derivative is adjusted to fair value at each reporting date, and changes in the fair value from the date of issuance have been included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement operations. 8. ISSUANCE OF RESTRICTED STOCK The Company issued 336,000 shares of common stock to a member of the senior management team on March 1, 2004. This issuance was made due to the exercise of previously granted stock options under their original terms and included 224,000 unvested shares issued as restricted stock. These shares of restricted stock vest in equal monthly installments through December 31, 2006.
9. BUSINESS ACQUISITION Acquisitions--On July 31, 2003, the Company completed a stock purchase acquisition of Evolution Electronics Limited ("Evolution"), a U.K. based producer of electronic keyboards. This strategic acquisition provides the Company with a class compliant line of high quality, affordable keyboards and MIDI controllers with strong brand recognition in the U.K. and Europe. The purchase price for Evolution was $4,341,053, consisting of cash of $3,116,964, 261,200 common shares with an estimated fair value of $1,095,578, and direct acquisition costs of $128,511. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the excess being ascribed to goodwill. The operations of Evolution are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The pro forma results of operations data for the six months ended July 31, 2003 and 2004 are not presented, as they would not have differed significantly from the amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 10. New Accounting Pronouncements FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities--an interpretation of ARB No. 51, was originally issued in January 2003 and subsequently revised in December 2003. FIN 46, as revised requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities in which a company has a significant interest, regardless of whether consolidation is required. Application of FIN 46 is required for potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application of the provisions will be required for all other variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company currently has no variable interest entities, therefore, the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope, which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. Also, mandatory redeemable financial instruments are subject to the provisions of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after December 31, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which supersedes SAB No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB No. 104's primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB No. 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF No. 00-21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The issuance of SAB No. 104 reflects the concepts contained in EITF No. 00-21; the other revenue recognition concepts contained in SAB No. 101 remain largely unchanged. The application of SAB No. 104 did not have any impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Exhibit 99.4 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The statements contained in this section may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based largely on management's expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Neither Avid nor Midiman undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. On August 20, 2004, Avid completed the acquisition of Midiman, Inc. ("Midiman") The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2003. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Midiman's is January 31. Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 with Midiman's statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 with Midiman's statement of operations for the six-month period ended July 31, 2004. A pro forma balance sheet is not presented because the acquisition has been reflected in our most recent balance sheet filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of an acquired entity based on their fair values as of the consummation of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values includes Avid management's consideration of a valuation of Midiman's intangible assets prepared by an independent valuation specialist. The allocation included in this pro forma financial information was based on the balance sheet of Midiman as of the acquisition date, August 20, 2004. As consideration for the acquisition, Avid paid $79.7 million in cash and issued 1,974,234 shares of common stock valued at approximately $84.3 million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Midiman. Additionally, Avid granted to Midiman employees stock options to purchase up to approximately 345,000 shares of Avid common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.21, in exchange for outstanding Midiman options. The market price used to value the Avid shares issued as partial consideration for Midiman and the Avid options issued in exchange for outstanding Midiman options was based on the 5 day average closing price of the stock during the period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced publicly. The following represents the purchase price for accounting purposes for the acquisition of Midiman (dollar amounts are in thousands, except for per share amounts):
Avid average market price per share $42.724 --------------- Avid common shares issued in exchange for equivalent shares of oustanding common stock of Midiman 1,974,234 --------------- In thousands: Portion of offer price for equivalent common shares settled in Avid common shares $84,347 Cash consideration paid 79,693 Fair value of Avid stock options exchanged for outstanding Midiman stock options 12,131 Estimated transaction costs of Avid 3,300 --------------- Total base purchase price $179,471 =============== The fair value of Avid stock options exchanged for outstanding Midiman options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions and results: Expected dividend yield 0.0 % Risk-free interest rate 3.0 % Expected volatility 59.0 % Expected life (in years) 2.2 Weighted average fair value of option $35.14 The purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of August 20, 2004. Independent valuation specialists assisted management of Avid in determining the fair values of the intangible assets (in thousand): Cash and cash equivalents $110 Accounts receivable 7,288 Inventories 13,420 Other current assets 903 Property and equipment 1,520 Intangible assets: Customer relationships 28,000 Trade name 4,700 Non-compete covenant 1,200 Developed technology 4,500 Goodwill 122,022 Current liabilities (9,692) Deferred compensation 5,500 -------------- $179,471 ==============
As part of the purchase agreement, Avid may be required to make additional payments to the former stockholders and option holders of Midiman of up to $45 million, contingent upon the operating results of the business acquired. These payments, if required, will be made through issuance of additional Avid shares and options, and will be recorded as additional purchase price allocated to goodwill, with a small portion (that related to options) recorded as compensation expense. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis which is management's best approximation of the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill resulting from the transaction is not amortized, but will be subject to an impairment test at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that the goodwill becomes impaired, Avid will incur an impairment charge for the amount of impairment during the period in which the determination is made. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Midiman included in this document, and of Avid included in Avid's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and Avid's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid that would have been reported had the acquisition of Midiman been completed as of the date presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid. For example, going forward, Avid may incur integration related expenses not reflected in the pro forma financial information.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements On August 20, 2004, Avid completed the acquisition of Midiman. For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2003. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Midiman's is January 31. Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 with Midiman's statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 with Midiman's statement of operations for the six-month period ended July 31, 2004. A pro forma balance sheet is not presented because the acquisition has been reflected in our most recent balance sheet filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (1) Represents reclassifications to conform Midiman's accounting and reporting policies to Avid's accounting and reporting policies. (2) Represents the reversal of intangible amortization expense resulting from acquisitions consummated previously by Midiman. (3) Represents the reversal of stock compensation expense relating to stock options issued by Midiman. (4) Represents the amortization of intangible assets established as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of Midiman. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis which is management's best approximation of the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the following number of years: Customer relationships 12 years Trade name 6 years Non-competition agreements 2 years Technology-based assets 4 years (5) Represents the reduction in investment income resulting from the reduced cash balance after payments to effect the acquisition of Midiman. (6) Represents the reversal of a loss associated with a put arrangement on preferred shares of Midiman, since the equity structure of Midiman has been replaced by the acquisition. (7) Adjusts the effective tax rate to that expected for the combined company. (8) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the issuance of Avid stock, based upon an exchange ratio of 0.22202 of a share of Avid stock for each share of Midiman common stock, including Midiman's preferred stock on an as-if converted basis and a common stock warrant on an as-if exercised basis. The average market price per share of Avid common stock of $42.72 was based on the 5 day average closing price of the stock during the period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced.
(9) Represents the amortization of deferred stock compensation expense for unvested stock options exchanged in the acquisition of Midiman by Avid. The deferred compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the assumed options. The amortization expense has been recorded in the expense category associated with the departmental classification of the grantee.

For Immediate Release
 
Avid Founder William J. Warner to Retire from Company's Board of Directors
 
Tewksbury, MA
 April 26, 2005  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that William J. Warner, the founder of the company and developer of its first digital nonlinear editing system, the Avid/1 Media Composer, will not seek re-election to Avid's Board of Directors at its next annual meeting, expected to take place in summer 2005.  Warner served as Avid's president from the company's incorporation in 1987 until 1991, when he left to start Wildfire Communications, Inc., a developer of voice-recognition telephony systems.  Warner has served continuously on Avid's Board of Directors since 1987.
 
Warner said, "Having helped Avid grow from a germ of an idea to a global leader in professional media creation tools, I have completed a long and fulfilling journey with the company.  Now I want to focus more fully on my new passion, which is helping entrepreneurs realize their intentions and unlock their potential for success.  Although I'm retiring as a board member of Avid, I have the highest level of confidence in its Board of Directors and management team, and I remain as excited as ever about the company's ability to develop ground-breaking technologies and pursue strategic opportunities  such as the planned acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, Inc. Avid has achieved a great deal over the past 18 years, and the company is in an excellent position to continue its trajectory of growth and innovation."
 
Avid's president and chief executive officer, David Krall, said, "As the founder of Avid and the guiding force behind the Media Composer digital nonlinear editing system, Bill Warner is one of the true pioneers of our industry  a visionary leader who almost single-handedly revolutionized the way films, TV shows, and broadcasts are made.  Over the years, Avid has benefited greatly from Bill's technical and business expertise, and from his unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation.  We wish Bill great success in all his future endeavors as we continue to execute on the plans that he helped put in place throughout his distinguished tenure at Avid."
 
Avid chairman of the board Nancy Hawthorne commented, "In the seven years that I have served on Avid's Board of Directors, I have seen first-hand how Bill's vast industry experience has shaped the
company's approach to innovation and influenced its business decisions.  Although I will miss working with Bill, I share his enthusiasm for our mission, and I'm confident that the principles on which he founded Avid will continue to guide the company well into the future."
 
In addition to his role on Avid's Board of Directors, Warner is the founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc. and of FutureBoston, Inc., an educational non-profit that builds tools and technology for urban planning.  Warner is also the founder and president of Warner Research, LLC, a software development firm focused on advanced online mapping, 3D, and archiving systems.  Warner serves on the boards of directors of Outdoor Explorations and the Massachusetts Software and Internet Council.  He has previously served on the boards of directors of The Creative Coalition, World Team Sports, and the Boston Children's Museum.
 
Following Warner's departure, the Avid Board of Directors will consist of the following members: Nancy Hawthorne, George Billings, Elizabeth Daley, John Guttag, David Krall and Pamela Lenehan.

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Reports Best-Ever First Quarter Revenues and Net Income Tewksbury, MA - April 28, 2005 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $166.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 - a 30% increase over the $127.4 million generated in the corresponding quarter in 2004. GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2005 was $20.3 million, compared to $14.8 million for the same quarter in 2004. GAAP net income for the quarter was $19.7 million, or $.53 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $14.7 million, or $.44 per diluted share, for the corresponding quarter in 2004. Excluding acquisition-related amortization and related tax benefits, acquisition-related stock-based compensation, non-recurring tax benefits, and expenses in the first quarter of 2004 related to the settlement of a lawsuit, pro forma non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2005 was $22.2 million, or $.60 per diluted share, compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $15.0 million, or $.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2004. "We've started 2005 with strong results from both our video and audio businesses," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Video revenues grew by 14%, on the strength of our broadcast and postproduction offerings - particularly the Avid DNA(TM) product family, which we recently upgraded to support a wide range of HD formats and resolutions. Our audio revenues were also up significantly, with a 74% increase over the first quarter of 2004 reflecting solid performance from Digidesign and from M-Audio following its addition to our audio business in the third quarter of 2004. Krall added, "We just returned from the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, where we had a great week. We made major announcements across our postproduction, broadcast, shared storage, and audio businesses, including the highly anticipated Avid(R) Symphony(TM) Nitris(R) finishing system and the new Avid iNEWS(R) Instinct(TM) journalist editor, both of which were recognized with awards at the show. All told, Avid won eleven industry awards, making it our most-decorated show in recent years." Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The pro forma operating results listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have included this information because we believe it is a meaningful measure of our normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of
operations on a comparative basis. This pro forma information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We use this information internally to help our management more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our operations and measure our performance on a comparative basis.

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Provides Preliminary Second Quarter 2005 Results Tewksbury, MA - July 13, 2005 - Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today provided its preliminary second quarter financial results. Total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, are projected to be in the area of $160 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2005, the sequential decline in revenue is a result of lower video revenues, primarily due to less broadcast revenue being recognized and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. "Uncertainty surrounding the timing of customer installation and acceptance of large deals is an inherent risk factor in our broadcast business," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Even though our broadcast revenues were down sequentially, our broadcast bookings were actually up over 10%. We expect revenues to increase sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter, but we anticipate that the combination of continuing unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts and a delay in shipping Avid(R) Symphony(TM) Nitris(R) will result in lower than previously expected revenues for the third quarter." The lower revenues in the second quarter are expected to result in a gross margin slightly lower than expected. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately in line with previous expectations. Taking into account the lower-than-expected revenue and gross profit, Avid's second quarter GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $12.0 to $13.0 million, or $.34 to $.36 per diluted share. Excluding approximately $2.3 million, or $.06 per diluted share, of acquisition-related amortization and related tax benefits, acquisition-related stock-based compensation and non-recurring tax benefits, second quarter non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $14.5 to $15.5 million, or $.40 to $.42 per diluted share. These projected results are subject to the normal quarter-end accounting review.
Avid expects to announce its second quarter results on Thursday, July 21, 2005, after the close of the market. Avid intends to hold a conference call that day at 5:00 p.m. EDT to discuss the results and provide information about the company's outlook for the balance of 2005. The dial-in number is: 312.461.9457 The replay number is: 719.457.0820 The confirmation code and replay passcode are: 4241723 The call will also be available via live audio Webcast and subsequent replay on the company's Web site. To listen via this alternative, go to the Investors page under the Company menu at www.avid.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The expected pro forma earnings per share listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We have included this information because we believe it is a meaningful measure of our normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis. This pro forma information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. We use this information internally to help our management more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our operations and measure our performance on a comparative basis. The above release includes a forward-looking statement, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's expected financial results. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from that indicated by such forward-looking statement, such as the competitive market in which Avid operates, market acceptance of Avid's existing and new products, Avid's ability to anticipate customers' needs and the other factors set forth under the caption "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Avid's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the
forward-looking statement contained herein represents Avid's estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update this forward-looking statement at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimate changes.

(NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $160.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 compared to $139.9 million for the same period in 2004. GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.6 million, or $.37 per diluted share compared to $15.5 million, or $.45 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding acquisition-related amortization and related tax benefits and acquisition-related stock-based compensation, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2005 was $15.9 million, or $.43 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $16.0 million, or $.47 per diluted share in the corresponding quarter of 2004. "This quarter's results were negatively impacted by new product delays in our core broadcast markets as well as the negative effects of foreign currency movements," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "These product delays have shifted out revenues in our broadcast business, but we are encouraged that the market demand for our broadcast products remains robust, as indicated by our sequential increase in broadcast orders and backlog, and that the fundamental growth indicators in each of the markets we serve are still pointing in the right direction." Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2005, were $326.1 million compared to revenues of $267.3 million for the same period in 2004. GAAP net income for the first six months of 2005 was $33.3 million, or $.90 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $30.2 million, or $.89 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Excluding acquisition-related amortization and related tax benefits, acquisition-related stock-based compensation, non-recurring tax benefits, and non-recurring expenses in the first quarter of 2004 related to the settlement of a lawsuit, non-GAAP net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $38.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $31.1 million, or $.92 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2004.

(NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCLE). Avid will issue approximately 6.2 million shares of stock and pay approximately $71.3 million in cash to Pinnacle shareholders and option holders. As of today's market close, Pinnacle Systems shares have ceased trading and Pinnacle has been delisted from the NASDAQ market. "The completion of this acquisition immediately strengthens Avid's ability to serve the industries that Make, Manage and Move Media," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Broadcasters who are transitioning from analog to all-digital production will now have immediate access to a wider selection of capabilities from Avid, and in the months ahead, they'll experience tighter interoperability between Pinnacle's broadcast products and Avid's end-to-end all-digital production environments. At the same time, we have formed a new Consumer division that will continue to leverage Pinnacle Systems' market-leading brand in the rapidly growing consumer video market. All told, with Pinnacle among the Avid family of companies, we've further cemented our position as a leading supplier of products and services to the world's digital media creators." With the integration process underway, Pinnacle's broadcast offerings - including the Deko(R) on-air graphics system and the MediaStream(TM) playout server - will be integrated into the Avid Video division, which will remain headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. Avid will also continue to develop the Pinnacle Liquid(TM) family, leveraging it across products and markets served by both the Avid Video and Consumer divisions. The new Consumer division, which will retain the Pinnacle Systems name and be headquartered in Mountain View, California, will house Pinnacle's consumer products, including Pinnacle Studio(TM) and other TV viewing products. Jeff Hastings, former chief operating officer of M-Audio, which Avid acquired in August of 2004, will assume the position of vice president and general manager of the new Pinnacle Systems division. Prior to his time at M-Audio, Hastings held a range of executive positions at consumer technology companies, including Rio Audio, where he served as president, as well as Sonic Blue and ReplayTV.

It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee," as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code. 2. Vesting Schedule. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the tenth anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the date of grant as indicated in the Notice (the "Grant Date"), subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan. 3. Exercise of Option. (a) Form of Exercise. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4 below. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share or for fewer than ten whole shares. (b) Continuous Relationship with the Company Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee or officer of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company (an "Eligible Optionee"). (c) Termination of Relationship with the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation. (d) Exercise Period Upon Retirement, Death or Disability. If the Optionee retires, dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "cause" as specified in paragraph (e) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of retirement, death or disability of the Optionee, by the Optionee (or in the case of death by an authorized transferee), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his or her retirement, death or disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.

Avid Technology, Inc. Nonstatutory Stock Option Grant Terms and Conditions 1. Grant of Option. Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Optionee identified in the attached Notice of Stock Option Grant (the "Notice") an option pursuant to the Company's Stock Plan identified in the Notice (the "Plan") to purchase a total number of shares as identified in the Notice (the "Shares") of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") at the price per share and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Notice and the Plan. It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee," as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code. 2. Vesting Schedule. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the tenth anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the date of grant as indicated in the Notice (the "Grant Date"), subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan. 3. Exercise of Option. (a) Form of Exercise. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4 below. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share or for fewer than ten whole shares. (b) Continuous Relationship with the Company Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company (an "Eligible Optionee"). (c) Termination of Relationship with the Company. If the Optionee ceases to be an Eligible Optionee for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. 1
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation. (d) Exercise Period Upon Retirement, Death or Disability. If the Optionee retires, dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "cause" as specified in paragraph (e) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of retirement, death or disability of the Optionee, by the Optionee (or in the case of death by an authorized transferee), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his or her retirement, death or disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date. For purposes of this Section 3, "retirement" shall mean the cessation of employment with the Company for any reason other than "cause" as specified in paragraph (e) below, by an Optionee who is a least 55 years of age and who has worked full-time for the Company for the five years immediately preceding the date of cessation of employment. (e) Discharge for Cause. If the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for "cause" (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. "Cause" shall mean willful misconduct by the Optionee or willful failure by the Optionee to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Optionee of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. The Optionee shall be considered to have been discharged for "Cause" if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Optionee's resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted. 4. Payment of Purchase Price. Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of this option shall be paid for as follows: (a) in cash or by check, payable to the order of the Company; (b) with the prior consent of the Company (which may be withheld in its sole discretion), by (i) delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding or (ii) delivery by the Optionee to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding; (c) if the Common Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee valued at their fair market value ("Fair Market Value") as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), provided (i) such method of payment is then permitted under applicable law, (ii) such Common Stock, if acquired directly from the Company, was owned by the 2
Optionnee for six months or such other minimum period of time, if any, as may be established by the Board in its discretion and (iii) such Common Stock is not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements; (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law and by the Board, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine; or (e) by any combination of the above permitted forms of payment. 5. Tax Matters. No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of this option unless and until the Optionee pays to the Company, or makes provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of this option. In the Board's discretion, and subject to such conditions as the Board may establish, such tax obligations may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including Shares retained from the option creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value. The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 6. Nontransferability of Option. This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the lifetime of the Optionee, this option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee. 7. Provisions of the Plan. This option is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Optionee with this option. 8. Miscellaneous. (a) Governing Law. This option shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to applicable conflicts of laws. (b) Severability.

Exhibit 99.2
 
The statements contained in this section may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based largely on management's expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Neither Avid nor Pinnacle undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements.
 
On August 9, 2005, Avid completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, Inc. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to this acquisition.   For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2004. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Pinnacle's is June 30.   Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 with Pinnacle's statement of operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 with Pinnacle's statement of operations for the six-month period ended March 31, 2005.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004 also gives effect to the acquisition by Avid of M-Audio completed in August 2004 as though Avid had acquired M-Audio on January 1, 2004.  For purposes of the balance sheet, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition of Pinnacle occurred as of June 30, 2005.  The pro forma balance sheet included herein combines Avid's balance sheet as of June 30, 2005 with Pinnacle's balance sheet as of March 31, 2005.
 
As consideration for the acquisition, Avid paid $72.1 million in cash and issued 6.2 million shares of common stock valued at approximately $362.9 million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Pinnacle.  Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle common shareholders received 0.0869 of a share of Avid common stock plus $1.00 in cash for each share of Pinnacle common stock outstanding at the closing of the transaction.  The market price used to value the Avid shares issued as partial consideration for Pinnacle was based upon a price of $58.09 per share of Avid common stock, which represents the 5 day average closing price of the stock during the period beginning two days before and ending two days after the merger announcement date of March 21, 2005.
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of an acquired entity based on their fair values as of the consummation of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values includes Avid management's consideration of a valuation of Pinnacle's intangible assets prepared by an independent valuation specialist. The allocation included in this pro forma financial information was based on the balance sheet of Pinnacle as of March 31, 2005.  The actual purchase accounting allocation will be revised to reflect the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired entity that exist as of the date of the acquisition A summary of the purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):
.
 
 
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, , goodwill resulting from the transaction is not amortized, but will be subject to an impairment test at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).  In the event that the goodwill becomes impaired, Avid will incur an impairment charge for the amount of impairment during the period in which the determination is made.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Pinnacle incorporated by reference into this document, and of Avid included in Avid's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and Avid's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid that would have been reported had the acquisition of Pinnacle been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Avid.  No effect has been given in these pro forma financial statements for synergistic benefits that may be realized through the combination of the two companies or costs that may be incurred in integrating their operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
 
On August 9, 2005, Avid completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, Inc. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to this acquisition.   For purposes of the statements of operations, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2004. Avid's fiscal year end is December 31 and Pinnacle's is June 30.   Therefore, the pro forma statements of operations herein combine Avid's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 with Pinnacle's statement of operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004, and Avid's statement of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 with Pinnacle's statement of operations for the six-month period ended March 31, 2005.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004 also gives effect to the acquisition by Avid of M-Audio completed in August 2004 as though Avid had acquired M-Audio on January 1, 2004.  For purposes of the balance sheet, the pro forma financial information is presented assuming the acquisition occurred as of June 30, 2005.  The pro forma balance sheet included herein combines Avid's balance sheet as of June 30, 2005 with Pinnacle's balance sheet as of March 31, 2005.
 
Footnotes to Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations
 
(1)    To include the results of operations of M-Audio from January 1, 2004 through August 20, 2004, the date M-Audio was acquired by Avid. Avid has included the results of operations of M-Audio in Avid's historical consolidated financial statements from August 20, 2004.
 
(2)    To eliminate the effects of transactions between Avid and Pinnacle.
 
(3)    To allocate pinnacle information technology costs to conform to Avid's financial statement presentation.
 
(4)    To record the amortization expense for the estimated identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of Pinnacle by Avid. The estimated identifiable intangible assets and their related estimated useful lives are as follows:
 
 
(5)    To reverse amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill resulting from acquisitions previously consummated by Pinnacle.
 
(6)    To record the reduction in interest income resulting from the reduced cash balance after payments to effect the acquisition of Pinnacle.
 
 
(7)    To record the amortization expense for the estimated identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of M-Audio by Avid. The estimated identifiable intangible assets and their related estimated useful lives are as follows:
 
 
(8)    Certain M-Audio amounts have been reclassified to conform to Avid's financial statement presentation.
 
(9)    To reverse amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions previously consummated by M-Audio.
 
(10)    To adjust the total tax provision to reflect the estimated effective tax rate of the combined company.
 
(11)    To record the additional amortization of deferred stock compensation expense for unvested stock options exchanged in the acquisition of M-Audio by Avid, assuming the acquisition of M-Audio by Avid occurred on January 1, 2004. The deferred compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the assumed options. The amortization expense has been recorded in the expense category associated with the departmental classification of the grantee.
 
(12)    To reverse stock compensation expense relating to stock options issued by M-Audio.
 
(13)    To reverse the loss associated with a put-arrangement on the preferred shares of M-Audio, since the equity structure of M-Audio has been replaced by the acquisition of M-Audio by Avid.
 
(14)    The pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding are calculated as follows:
 
 
 
Note that Pinnacle's historical weighted average common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 of 69,730,000 and 68,840,000, respectively, were cancelled upon consummation of the merger.

(8)    To reverse Pinnacle historical equity balances.
 
(9)    To record Avid's equity consideration for the acquisition of Pinnacle.
 
(10)    To reflect the estimated fair value of in-process research and development. Because this expense is directly attributable to the acquisition of Pinnacle and will not have a continuing impact, it is not reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. However, this item will be recorded as an expense in the third fiscal quarter.
 
(11)    To adjust inventory, property and equipment and other assets to fair market value.
 
(12)    To adjust income taxes payable to fair market value, record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effect of book and tax basis differences attributable to the fair value adjustments and record a deferred tax liability of $7.2 million associated with non-deductible identifiable intangible assets.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Description 99.1 Press release issued by the Registrant dated October 27, 2005. 4

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Reports Strong Third Quarter Results Tewksbury, MA - October 27, 2005 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $204.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $147.4 million for the same period in 2004. Reflecting various non-cash charges primarily associated with the closing of the acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, Inc. on August 9, 2005, GAAP net loss for the quarter was $17.8 million, or $.46 per share compared to GAAP net income of $19.0 million, or $.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $24.2 million, or $.60 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $20.4 million, or $.58 per diluted share in the corresponding quarter of 2004. In order to calculate non-GAAP net income, which the company believes is a more meaningful measure of normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding results of operations on a comparative basis, the following items have been excluded from third quarter 2005 GAAP net loss: o A non-recurring in-process research and development charge of $32.4 million related to the Pinnacle acquisition. o Non-cash acquisition-related amortization charges of $6.4 million. o Restructuring costs of $2 million reflecting a revised estimate of a loss on a facility vacated by Avid in 1999. o A Pinnacle acquisition-related tax charge of $1.2 million, offset by $468,000 of tax benefits related to acquisition-related amortization and restructuring. o Stock-based compensation charges of $458,000 related to the acquisition of M-Audio in August 2004. "We had a strong third quarter with all segments performing well," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "We are especially pleased with the performance of our broadcast and storage solutions in our video division. The integration of the Deko and MediaStream products from Pinnacle into our broadcast offering is off to a great start, and we're looking forward to offering our broadcast customers an even more complete solution than we have in the past. Audio also had a strong quarter, with Digidesign benefiting from the release of the Mbox(R) 2 portable micro-studio and continuing demand for its digital mixing consoles. Finally, our new Pinnacle consumer segment delivered a solid quarter, driven by the release of Pinnacle Studio(TM) version 10."
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, were $530.5 million compared to revenues of $414.6 million for the same period in 2004. GAAP net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $15.6 million, or $.41 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $49.2 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Excluding the in-process research and development charge, acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation, the Pinnacle acquisition-related tax charge, the tax benefit related to amortization, restructuring costs, and non-recurring expenses in the first quarter of 2004 related to the settlement of a lawsuit, non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, was $62.3 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $51.4 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2004. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP operating results listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These results have been included because management believes they are a meaningful measure of normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding the company's results of operations on a comparative basis. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management uses this information internally to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of operations and to measure performance on a comparative basis. Conference Call A conference call to discuss Avid's third quarter 2005 financial results and the company's outlook for the fourth quarter of 2005 and the full year 2006 will be held today, October 27, at 5:00 p.m. EDT. The call will be open to the public, and can be accessed by dialing (913) 981-5509 and referencing confirmation code 6447118. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avid's web site. To listen via this alternative, go to the Investor Relations page under the About Us menu at www.avid.com for complete details 10-15 minutes prior to the start of the conference call. The above release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's future performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from that indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as the competitive market in which Avid operates, market acceptance of Avid's existing and new products, Avid's ability to anticipate customer needs and the other factors set forth under the caption "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Avid's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimate changes.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On January 1, 2006, Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") will be required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) - Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which requires the Company to recognize the compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions, including the issuance of stock options, in the Company's financial statements. Currently, the Company accounts for its share-based payment transactions using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25 and is not required to recognize compensation cost in the Company's financial statements. In anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), on October 26, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a partial acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding options to purchase the Company's common stock that were granted on February 17, 2005 so that all of such stock options became exercisable as to an additional number of shares equal to the number that would have been exercisable as of December 31, 2007. As a result, vesting was accelerated for options to purchase 371,587 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share, with an exercise price of $65.81 per share, including options to purchase 157,624 shares of the Company's common stock held by the Company's executive officers. No options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock held by the Company's non-employee directors were included in this acceleration. The decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to avoid recognizing compensation cost in the Company's future statements of operations upon the effectiveness of SFAS 123(R). It is estimated that the maximum future compensation expense that would have been recorded in the Company's statements of operations had the vesting of these options not been accelerated is approximately $4.9 million. The Company will disclose the impact of the acceleration in its December 31, 2005 financial statements within its pro forma footnote disclosures, as permitted under the transition guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 2

Avid Announces Delay in Filing Form 10-Q for Third Quarter of 2005 Tewksbury, MA - November 10, 2005 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that it is delaying the filing of its financial results on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 to allow the company additional time to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for a portion of the revenue attributable to its new consumer video division, which was recently acquired in a merger with Pinnacle Systems, Inc. This revenue substantially relates to partial shipments to European resellers of available consumer video products to fulfill orders placed during the third quarter. Revenue reported by the company in its third quarter earnings release included the value of these consumer products actually shipped to the resellers. The company is evaluating whether revenue recognized on partial shipments must be deferred until the orders are completely delivered. As the company gathers data to support its previously released third quarter revenue, it expects that revenue determined to be not recordable in the third quarter, if any, will be fully recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005. Avid will be filing a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today in connection with the delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The above release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's future performance. Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "will" and other similar expressions help identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements including, Avid's ability to complete the assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition for the revenue attributable to its new consumer video division described above on a timely basis, the results of such assessment, Avid's ability to recognize the revenue during the fourth quarter of 2005, any amendments to previous filings required as a result of that assessment, and the other factors set forth under the caption "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Avid's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing Avid's estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimate changes.

(NASDAQ: AVID) today filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005. The company delayed the Form 10-Q filing to allow additional time to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for a portion of the revenue attributable to its new consumer video division, which was recently acquired in a merger with Pinnacle Systems, Inc.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 2006 Bonus Plan On December 7, 2005, the independent members of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Avid Technology, Inc. 2006 Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). All employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2006, certain employees hired as a result of acquisitions and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must remain employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive their awards, if any. The Company may modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time at its sole discretion. The purpose of the Plan is to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2006, as well as for individual performance and contributions. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company must achieve revenue and operating profit above a specified level in order for any bonuses to be paid under the Plan. An individual participant's bonus payout under the Plan ("Bonus Payout") is based on three factors: the participant's "Target Award" (as defined below), the results of the participant's business unit ("Business Unit Performance"), and the participant's individual performance ("Individual Performance"). Mathematically, this can be represented as: Bonus Payout = Target Award X Business Unit Performance X Individual Performance Target Awards range from 5% to 140% of a participant's base salary, based on the organizational structure of the Company. For purposes of the Plan, all participants are grouped into one of four business units: corporate, audio, consumer and video. For each of the business units, Business Unit Performance is measured by revenue and operating profit. As a threshold matter, for all business units, 2006 revenues must be greater than 2005 revenues (as may be adjusted by the Board for any acquisitions made by the Company) for any Bonus Payouts to be made to participants in that business unit. Business Unit Performance is also measured by operating profit. Once a business unit meets an established minimum operating profit threshold ("Threshold Operating Profit"), participants in that business unit become eligible to receive a percentage of their Target Awards up to 100% if the target operating profit ("Target Operating Profit") is achieved, subject to their position within that business unit and further subject to their Individual Performance, each as described below. Specific Threshold and Target Operating Profits are set for each of the corporate, video, consumer and audio business units The Target Operating Profit for the corporate business unit is the sum of the Target Operating Profits of the Company's audio, consumer and video business units. If the corporate business unit exceeds its Target Operating Profit, for every $1.00 of incremental profit in excess of the corporate business unit's Target Operating Profit, an additional $0.15 is distributed among all participants whose business units exceeded their Target Operating Profits. 2
The Business Unit Performance component of a participant's Bonus Payout is determined as follows: (1) for executive officers and other corporate vice presidents, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of the corporate business unit; (2) for vice presidents in the audio, consumer and video business units, 75% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their respective business unit and the remaining 25% is based on corporate business unit results; and (3) for participants below the vice president level, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their business unit. Finally, there is an Individual Performance component to the Bonus Payout. Based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other participants) of the participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company, a multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to the participant's Target Award in order to determine the participant's Bonus Payout. Accordingly, this Individual Performance component may increase a participant's Bonus Payout by as much as 20% of such participant's Target Award or, in other circumstances, reduce the award to zero. Bonus Payouts under the Plan will be determined after financial results for 2006 are publicly released, which is currently anticipated to be in February 2007. Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be paid in February 2007. The full text of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Board of Director Compensation On December 7, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved modifications to the annual cash compensation for non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Effective January 1, 2006, the annual cash compensation is as follows: o a $25,000 annual retainer for each non-employee director; o a $30,000 annual retainer for the Chair of the Board of Directors (in addition to the $25,000 annual retainer paid to all non-employee directors); o a $10,000 annual retainer for the Chair of each of the Audit, Nominating and Governance, Strategy and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors (provided that the Chair of such committee is a non-employee director); o a payment of $1,500 to each non-employee member of the Board of Directors for each meeting attended; and o a payment of $1,500 to each non-employee member of the Audit, Nominating and Governance, Strategy and Compensation Committees for each meeting attended. 3
The equity compensation that each non-employee member of the Board of Directors receives has not changed. On the date of the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors receives a non-qualified stock option grant to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, provided such Board member has served a minimum of six months on the Board of Directors. In addition, upon initial election to the Board of Directors, non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive a non-qualified stock option grant to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. The stock options described above will be issued pursuant to the Company's 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on April 13, 2005 and by the Company's stockholders on July 27, 2005.

AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC. Avid Technology Park One Park West Tewksbury, MA 01876 2006 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN On December 7, 2005, the independent members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") adopted this 2006 Employee Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). PURPOSE OF THE PLAN The purpose of this Plan is: (1) to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and (2) to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2006, as well as for individual performance and contributions. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" includes any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board. ADMINISTRATION The Plan is administered by the Board. The Board has the exclusive right to administer, interpret and decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan including, without limitation, the right to modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time in its sole discretion. All decisions by the Board are made in the Board's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan. No director or person acting pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board will be liable for any action or determination relating to or under the Plan made in good faith. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more executive officers of the Company such powers under the Plan as the Board may determine in its discretion, provided that the Board shall determine the Bonus Payout (as defined below) for each executive officer of the Company. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (each, a "Committee"). All references in the Plan to the "Board" means the Board or a Committee of the Board or the executive officer referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the extent that the Board's powers or authority under the Plan have been delegated to such Committee or executive officer. 1
ELIGIBILITY All Company employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2006 and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must be employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive their award, if any. Each such eligible employee is deemed a "Participant" in the Plan. BONUS PAYOUTS A Participant's bonus payout under the 2006 Bonus Plan ("Bonus Payout") is based on three factors, each as defined below: (1) the Participant's Target Award; (2) the financial performance of the Participant's Business Unit ("Business Unit Performance"); and (3) the Participant's individual performance ("Individual Performance"). Target Award. A "Participant's Target Award" is an amount between 5% and 140% of a Participant's base salary, based on various factors (as determined by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants), including the Participant's role and position within the organizational structure of the Company. The "Company Target Award" or a "Business Unit Target Award" is the sum of the Target Awards for all Participants in the Company or such business unit, as the case may be. Business Unit Performance. The Business Unit Performance component of a Participant's Bonus Payout is an objective measurement of a business unit's financial results based on both revenue and operating profit, as further discussed below. Individual Performance. Based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants) of the Participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company, a multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to the Participant's Target Award in order to determine the Participant's Bonus Payout. Accordingly, this Individual Performance component may increase a Participant's Bonus Payout by as much as 20% of such Participant's Target Award or, in other circumstances, reduce the award to zero. PLAN GOALS AND MEASUREMENT For purposes of the Plan, all Participants are grouped into one of four business units: Corporate, Audio, Consumer or Video. For each of the business units, Business Unit Performance is measured by both revenue and operating profit. In order for a Participant to receive a bonus, revenue and operating profit for the Company and the Participant's business unit must exceed minimum amounts established by the Board, as further described below. 2
As a threshold matter, for all business units, the Company's (1) 2006 revenues must exceed the Company's 2005 revenues (as may be adjusted by the Board for any acquisitions made by the Company) and (2) 2006 operating profit must exceed a minimum amount established by the Board for any Bonus Payout to be made to any Participant. Business Unit Performance is measured by revenue and operating profit. Once a business unit meets a minimum revenue threshold and a minimum operating profit threshold ("Threshold Operating Profit"), each as established by the Board, Participants in that business unit become eligible to receive a percentage of their Target Awards (up to 100%) if the target operating profit ("Target Operating Profit") is achieved, subject to their Individual Performance. The Target Operating Profit is an amount set by the Board which exceeds the Threshold Operating Profit and is based on the Company's operating plan for 2006. The Threshold Operating Profit and Target Operating Profit levels are set by the Board for the Video, Consumer, Audio and Corporate business units. The Target Operating Profit for the Corporate business unit is the sum of the Target Operating Profits for the Audio, Consumer and Video business units. If the Corporate business unit exceeds its Target Operating Profit, 15% of such excess amount (the "Over-Achievement Pool") will be added to the total bonus pool available for all Participants whose business unit exceeds its Target Operating Profit (each, a "Qualifying Business Unit"). The Over-Achievement Pool will first be divided between the Corporate business unit and the other Qualifying Business Unit(s) in proportion to each unit's Target Award. The portion of the Over-Achievement Pool that is allocated to the non-Corporate Qualifying Business Unit(s) will then be divided proportionally based on each non-Corporate Qualifying Business Unit's contribution to operating profit in excess of the Target Operating Profit. The Business Unit Performance component of a Participant's Bonus Payout is determined as follows: (1) for executive officers of the Company and vice presidents in the Corporate business unit, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of the Corporate business unit; (2) for vice presidents in the Audio, Consumer and Video business units, 75% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their respective business unit and the remaining 25% is based on the Corporate business unit results; and (3) for all Participants below the vice president level, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their respective business unit. PRO-RATED BONUS PAYOUTS Bonus Payouts may be pro-rated under the following circumstances: 1. Any salary change occurring in the year will be automatically pro-rated, as Bonus Payouts are calculated on the actual base salary paid during 2006. For purposes of the Plan, actual base salary includes regular wages, vacation, sick time and holiday time, but not leave of absence pay, overtime, shift differential or other premium pay. 3
2. If a Participant is hired after January 1, 2006, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be pro-rated to include only that portion of the year for which the Participant was employed by the Company. For example, if the Participant is hired on July 1, 2006, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be based on a half year's base salary. 3. If a Participant transfers between business units during the year, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be pro-rated for the time spent in each business unit. 4. If an individual in a temporary position becomes an employee, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be calculated on the actual base salary paid after becoming an employee. 5. If a Participant is promoted after January 1, 2006 to a position with a higher Target Award, the Bonus Payout will be adjusted to account for the portion of the year spent at each position. 6. If a Participant is on an approved leave of absence for part of the year, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be calculated based on the actual base salary paid during the year. Employees who are on an approved leave of absence on the Bonus Payout date will be considered to be employed for purposes of this Plan. 7. If a Participant becomes disabled and qualifies for benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan, the Participant's Bonus Payout will be calculated on the actual base salary paid while on the Company payroll as an employee. 8. For employees that are hired during the year as a result of an acquisition, initial eligibility for participation in the Plan will be determined on a deal-by-deal basis. TIMING OF PLAN PAYOUT Bonus Payouts under the Plan will be determined after the Company's financial results for 2006 are publicly released, which is currently anticipated to be in February 2007. Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be paid in February 2007. MISCELLANEOUS Nothing in this Plan will be construed as creating an employment relationship between a Participant and the Company, nor is the Plan intended to be a guarantee of any kind of compensation or any other binding commitment of the Company. The Company may modify Bonus Payouts or establish separate procedures for Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed outside the United States in order to comply with laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, currency, employee benefits or other matters. The provisions of this Plan and all awards made hereunder shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the rules governing conflicts of law. 4

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Finishes 2005 with Solid Fourth Quarter Results Tewksbury, MA - January 26, 2006 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $245.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $175.0 million for the same period in 2004. GAAP net income for the quarter was $18.4 million, or $.43 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $22.5 million, or $.61 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $30.1 million, or $.69 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $23.4 million, or $.64 per diluted share in the corresponding quarter of 2004. In order to calculate non-GAAP net income, which the company believes is a more meaningful measure of normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding results of operations on a comparative basis, the following items have been excluded from fourth quarter 2005 GAAP net income: o Non-cash acquisition-related amortization totaling $10.1 million. o Restructuring charges of $1.2 million related to vacating a facility and reducing headcount in Montreal. o Acquisition-related stock-based compensation charges and net tax provisions, and other non-recurring tax benefits of $394,000. "We finished 2005 with a solid fourth quarter," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Our professional video segment posted good results in the quarter led by strong sales of Avid(R) Symphony(TM) Nitris(R) into the postproduction market and Avid Unity ISIS(TM) to our broadcast customers. Audio had a strong quarter, with record sales of Digidesign's Mbox(R) portable micro-studio, continuing demand for digital mixing consoles for both the studio and live sound markets and new product launches by M-Audio for the home studio. Finally, our consumer segment delivered a profitable quarter, as Pinnacle Studio(TM) version 10 was available during the important holiday buying season."
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, were $775.4 million compared to revenues of $589.6 million for 2004. GAAP net income for 2005 was $34.0 million, or $.86 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $71.7 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, for 2004. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $92.4 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to $74.9 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, for 2004.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP operating results listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These results have been included because management believes they are a meaningful measure of normalized operating performance and will assist investors in understanding the company's results of operations on a comparative basis. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management uses this information internally to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of operations and to measure performance on a comparative basis.

Previous independent registered public accounting firm
         
 
On March 16, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as its independent registered public accounting firm.
 
The reports of PWC on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.  During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and through March 16, 2006, there were no disagreements with PWC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PWC, would have caused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the Company's financial statements for such years.  During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and through March 16, 2006, there were no "reportable events" as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v).
 
The Company has requested PWC to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements.  A copy of that letter is filed as Exhibit 16.01 to this Form 8-K.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and through March 16, 2006, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with E&Y with respect to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Provides Preliminary First Quarter 2006 Results Tewksbury, MA - April 11, 2006 - Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today provided its preliminary first quarter financial results. Total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, are estimated to be between $216 and $218 million. First quarter revenues were negatively impacted by lower-than expected sales of playout servers and on-air graphics, add-on and local storage, and European consumer products. At this revenue range, Avid's first quarter GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $700,000 to $2.0 million, or $.02 to $.05 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related charges, related tax benefits, stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, first quarter non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $15.2 to $16.5 million, or $.35 to $.38 per diluted share. These projected results are subject to the normal quarter-end accounting review. While the company is still in the process of closing its books and reviewing its first quarter results of operations, preliminary analysis indicates that full year 2006 revenues are expected to be between $940 million and $970 million, reflecting lower expectations for the professional video and consumer segments. The company's audio segment revenue expectations for the balance of 2006 are unchanged. The primary drivers for the lower full-year revenue estimate include lower storage revenues in part due to a delay in add-on storage sales as customers transition to the new Avid Unity ISIS solution. In addition, lower broadcast revenue is anticipated due to lower demand for playout servers and on-air graphics products. The company also now anticipates a higher proportion of larger broadcast bookings in 2006 that will not be fully recognized until 2007, as the installation and acceptance of these transactions occurs. For consumer video, the company anticipates a continuing shortfall for the remainder of the year resulting from initial quality issues surrounding the introduction of Pinnacle Studio(TM) version 10.
"While we are clearly disappointed with our preliminary results for Q1, and we have made what we believe are appropriate adjustments to our 2006 outlook and expense plan, we remain positive about the longer-term prospects for our company and our markets, " said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "We are anticipating a strong showing at this year's National Association of Broadcasters convention, and will discuss the results from this trade show as well as from Q1 on our next scheduled earnings conference call on May 4th." Full-year 2006 GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $0.95 and $1.20 and non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $2.15 and $2.40. Avid expects to announce its first quarter results and provide a detailed update to its 2006 outlook on Thursday, May 4, 2006, after the close of the market. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP operating results and expected non-GAAP earnings per share listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We believe it is useful for ourselves and investors to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to assess our performance and our planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures are a meaningful measure of our operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis. Specifically, in addition to the reasons stated above, we exclude stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP measures based on our desire to offer consistent information that is comparable to previous information that we have publicly disclosed. The above release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's expected financial results. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from that indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as competitive factors, including pricing pressures, fluctuating currency exchange rates, delays in product shipments, market acceptance of Avid's
existing and new products, Avid's ability to anticipate customer needs and the other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimate changes.

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com --------------------------- Avid Reports First Quarter 2006 Results Tewksbury, MA - May 4, 2006 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $218.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 compared to $166.0 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the quarter was $3.3 million, or $.08 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $19.7 million, or $.53 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $16.1 million, or $.37 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $22.2 million, or $.60 per diluted share in the corresponding quarter of 2005. In order to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share, which the company believes is a meaningful measure of our operating performance and will assist investors in understanding results of operations on a comparative basis, the following adjustments were made to first quarter 2006 and 2005 GAAP earnings per share: 2006 2005 ---- ---- Non-cash acquisition-related amortization $ .20 .05 Non-cash stock-based compensation charges .10 $ .02 Non-recurring and other tax adjustments (.04) -- Restructuring charges .02 -- In-process research and development .01 -- --- ---- TOTAL $ .29 $ .07 "Our results for the quarter were in line with the preliminary results announced on April 11. These results reflect lower-than-expected sales of broadcast products including playout servers and on-air graphics, add-on and local storage, and European consumer products," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we're pleased with the momentum we created at last week's National Association of Broadcasters convention, where Avid just completed one of its strongest showings in years. In particular, Avid's new Open Storage Initiative was received well by partners and customers alike, and TV Technology Magazine recognized Avid as a Superior Technology Award Recipient (STAR) for our new Interplay(TM) nonlinear workflow engine. We also received Pick Hits awards for our new software-only Media Composer(R) and Avid
Mojo(R) SDI, from Broadcast Engineering Magazine, as well as a VIDY award from Videography Magazine for Avid Unity ISIS(TM). These products are all expected to be strong contributors to Avid's results this year." Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP operating results and non-GAAP earnings per share listed above are "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures are a meaningful measure of our operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this release exclude the accounting treatment of stock-based compensation, and these non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon independently, as they ignore the contribution to our operating results that is generated by the incentive and compensation effects of the underlying stock-based compensation programs. In addition to the reasons stated above, we have excluded stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP measures based on our desire to offer consistent information that is comparable to previous information that we have publicly disclosed.

Avid Technology, Inc. --------------------- Nonstatutory Stock Option Grant Terms and Conditions -------------------- (Form for Non-Employee Directors) --------------------------------- 1. Grant of Option. Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Optionee identified in the attached Notice of Stock Option Grant (the "Notice") an option pursuant to the Company's Stock Plan identified in the Notice (the "Plan") to purchase a total number of shares as identified in the Notice (the "Shares") of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") at the price per share and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Notice and the Plan. It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee," as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code. 2. Vesting Schedule. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the tenth anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the date of grant as indicated in the Notice (the "Grant Date"), subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan. 3. Exercise of Option. (a) Form of Exercise. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4 below. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share or for fewer than ten whole shares. (b) Continuous Relationship with the Company Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, a member of the Company's Board of Directors (an "Eligible Optionee"). (c) Termination of Relationship with the Company. If the Optionee ceases to be an Eligible Optionee for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraph (e) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate three 1
months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation. (d) Acceleration. This option shall become exercisable in full if, while the Optionee is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "cause" as specified in paragraph (e) below, the Optionee dies, becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), retires following at least 10 years of service as a member of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") or reaches mandatory retirement age, provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date. For purposes of this Section 3(d), "mandatory retirement age" shall mean the age of the Optionee at the time the Optionee is no longer eligible to stand for re-election to the Board as set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. (e) Discharge for Cause. If the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for "cause" (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. "Cause" shall mean willful misconduct by the Optionee or willful failure by the Optionee to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Optionee of any provision of any nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. The Optionee shall be considered to have been discharged for "Cause" if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Optionee's resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted. 4. Payment of Purchase Price. Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of this option shall be paid for as follows: (a) in cash or by check, payable to the order of the Company; (b) with the prior consent of the Company (which may be withheld in its sole discretion), by (i) delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding or (ii) delivery by the Optionee to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding; (c) if the Common Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee valued at their fair market value ("Fair Market Value") as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board , provided (i) such method of payment is then permitted under applicable law, (ii) such Common Stock, if acquired directly from the Company, was owned by the Optionee for six months or such other minimum period of time, if any, as may be established by the Board in its discretion and (iii) 2
such Common Stock is not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements; (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law and by the Board, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine; or (e) by any combination of the above permitted forms of payment. 5. Tax Matters. The Optionee shall be solely responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be paid in connection with this option. 6. Nontransferability of Option. This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the lifetime of the Optionee, this option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee. 7. Provisions of the Plan. This option is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Optionee with this option. 8. Miscellaneous. (a) Governing Law. This option shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to applicable conflicts of laws. (b) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and each such other provision shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. (c) Binding Effect. These terms and conditions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Optionee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns. (d) Entire Agreement. These terms and conditions, the attached Notice and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof. (e) Amendment. These terms and conditions may only be amended or modified in accordance with the Plan. 3

Contact: Dean Ridlon, Investor Relations Director Phone: 978.640.5309 Email: Investor_Relations@avid.com Avid Reports Solid Second Quarter 2006 Results Announces Authorization to Repurchase Up To $50 Million of Stock Tewksbury, MA - July 20, 2006 - Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $222.2 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2006 compared to $160.1 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the quarter was $2.7 million, or $.06 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $13.6 million, or $.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005. GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2006 includes $11.8 million of non-cash acquisition related charges, non-cash stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments. This compares to $2.3 million of acquisition related charges, stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2005. "Our June quarter results were solid," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "Contributing substantially to these results was the on-schedule delivery of all of the new products announced at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in April that were scheduled to ship during the second quarter. We continue to emphasize the importance of delivering new products to our customers on time, and our Interplay(TM) nonlinear workflow engine is still expected to ship in the third quarter. In broadcast, we had a strong bookings quarter and increased our backlog substantially. We continue to rebuild our consumer business, and the improvements that have been made to Pinnacle Studio(TM) 10 are being reflected by significant increases in user satisfaction ratings. Finally, our audio business had another good quarter, highlighted by strong performances in both our home recording and live sound markets." Revenues for the six month period ended June 30, 2006, were $440.3 million compared to revenues of $326.1 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the first six months of 2006 was $6.0 million, or $.14 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $33.3 million, or $.90 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2006 includes $24.6 million of non-cash acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation charges, restructuring charges, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments. This compares to $4.8 million of acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2005.
Stock Repurchase Program Avid also announced that its Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $50 million of stock through transactions on the open market, in block trades or otherwise. The stock repurchase program will be funded using the company's working capital. As of June 30, 2006, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $238.1 million. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release may contain "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to extend the time period within which any option may be exercised beyond the period specified in the applicable stock plan or under the terms of any
 
4
Exec.Employ.Agt12.07.05
 
grant, award agreement or form for exercising any right under any such plan.

If any of the payments to be made to Executive under this Article 4 constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), then if Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments will be delayed to the date that is 6 months after Executive's Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"). Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date.
Article 5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
5.1.
        
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
. Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of one (1) year after the Date of Termination of Executive's employment hereunder:
5.1.1.
     
Executive will not engage in any activity which is competitive with any business which is now, or is at any time during Executive's employment with the Company, conducted by the Company, including without limitation becoming an employee, investor (except for passive investments of not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of, or any other equity interest in, a company or entity listed or traded on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter securities market), officer, agent, partner or director of, or other participant in, any firm, person or other entity in any geographic area that competes or plans to compete with the Company in the business of the development, manufacture, promotion, distribution or sale of digital film, video or audio editing, special effects, 3D or newsroom automation systems or products or other business in which the Company is engaged or plans to engage at the time of Executive's termination.
5.1.2.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly assist others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is prohibited to engage by Section 5.1.1 above.

5
Exec.Employ.Agt12.07.05
 
any current or future customer or supplier of the Company to cease doing business in whole or in part with the Company or otherwise adversely modify his, her or its business relationship with the Company.
5.2.
        
Reasonableness of Restrictions
. It is expressly understood and agreed that (a) although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Article 5 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Article 5 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (b) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
5.3.
        
Remedies for Breach
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 5 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions or any other equitable remedy which may then be available. Executive hereby irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit, or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence of any breach of Section 5.1, if Executive is employed by the Company, the Company may immediately terminate the employment of Executive for Cause in accordance with Section 4.1.3, and, whether or not Executive is employed by the Company, the Company shall immediately cease to have any obligations to make payments to Executive under this Agreement.
5.4.
        
Survival
. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or Executive's services hereunder for any reason, this Article 5 shall survive any such termination.

Change-in-Control Agreement
Date: October 13, 2006
Graham Sharp
Avid Technology, Inc.
Avid Technology Park
One Park West
Tewksbury, MA 01876
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. ("Avid" or the "Company") recognizes that your contributions to the future growth and success of the Company will be substantial and the Board desires to assure the Company of your continued services for the benefit of the Company, particularly in the face of a change-in-control of the Company.
This letter agreement ("Agreement") therefore sets forth those benefits that the Company will provide to you in the event your employment within the Company is terminated after a "Change in Control of the Company" (as defined in Paragraph 2(i)) under the circumstances described below.
If a Change in Control of the Company should occur while you are still an employee of the Company, then this Agreement shall continue in effect from the date of such Change in Control of the Company for so long as you remain an employee of the Company, but in no event for more than two full calendar years following such Change in Control of the Company; provided, however, that the expiration of the term of this Agreement shall not adversely affect your rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. If no Change in Control of the Company occurs before your status as an employee of the Company is terminated, this Agreement shall expire on such date. Prior to a Change in Control of the Company, (a) your employment may be terminated by the Company or by you, in each case only in accordance with the provisions of your Executive Employment Agreement dated October 13, 2006, and (b) this Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon written notice to you, and in either such event (termination of your employment, or termination of this Agreement, prior to a Change in Control), you shall not be entitled to any of the benefits provided hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement following the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control of the Company (as defined in Paragraph 2(ii)) unless (a) at least one year has expired since the most recent event or transaction constituting a Potential Change in Control of the
 
 
Graham Sharp

Company and (b) in respect of a Potential Change in Control of the Company which previously occurred, no facts or circumstances continue to exist which, if initially occurring at the time any termination of this Agreement is to occur, would constitute a Potential Change in Control of the Company.
 
(i)
           
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred only if any of the following events occur:
(a)
          
The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))(a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which satisfies the criteria set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 2(i); or
(b)
          
Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequently to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c)
          
Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners,
 
CICAgt.11.23.05

respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 40% of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (which as used in this Paragraph 2(i)(c) shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be and (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination, or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation.
(ii)
          
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Potential Change in Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company shall enter into a merger, acquisition or similar agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, or (B) any person shall publicly announce an intention to take actions which if consummated would constitute a Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any event or transaction which would otherwise constitute a Potential Change in Control of the Company shall not constitute a Potential Change in Control of the Company if the negotiations or other actions leading to such event or transaction were initiated by the Company (it being understood that the occurrence of such a Company-initiated event or transaction shall not affect the existence of any Potential Change in Control of the Company resulting from any other event or transaction).
If a Change in Control of the Company shall have occurred while you are still an employee of the Company, you shall be entitled to the payments and benefits provided in Paragraph 4 hereof upon the subsequent termination of your employment within twenty-four (24) months after such Change in Control, by you or by the Company, unless such termination is (a) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below) or (b) by you other than for "Good Reason" (as defined below); in either such event, you shall not be entitled to receive benefits under this Agreement.

the willful and continued failure by you substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any failure resulting from your terminating your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below)) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or
(B)
         
a breach of the Invention and Non-Disclosure Agreement, between you and the Company, which is not cured after ten (10) days' written notice from the Company (if such breach is susceptible to cure), or
(C)
         
the willful engaging by you in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, or

(i)
           
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to you or for your benefit and/or any acceleration of vesting of any options or restricted stock awards (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable or provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Payments shall be reduced, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5(i), if it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate present value (determined in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations) of the payments eliminated pursuant to the preceding sentence (the "Eliminated Payments") exceeds by at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)(ii) the aggregate present value of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by you if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to you (including state and federal income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, any Excise Tax, and any withholding taxes) then no reduction in the Payments shall be made.
(ii)
          
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 5(i), all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph 5, including whether any Payments need to be reduced or eliminated and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group affecting the Change of Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.

Avid Reports Third Quarter 2006 Results
 
Tewksbury, MA
 October 26, 2006  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $231.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2006 compared to $204.4 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the quarter was $3.6 million, or $.08 per diluted share compared to a GAAP net loss of $17.8 million, or $.46 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2006 includes $14.3 million of non-cash charges including amortization, in-process research and development, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related tax adjustments. This compares to $42 million of non-cash acquisition-related charges including amortization, in-process research and development, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and related tax adjustments included in the GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2005.
 
"Our professional video business had a solid quarter, with record broadcast bookings driving a 23% sequential increase in that segment's backlog, and healthy demand for our HD-enabled postproduction solutions yielding growth in our post business," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer.  "As previously announced, we had a slowdown in demand at quarter-end for Digidesign's Pro Tools|HD systems. Now that many of the best-selling third-party Pro Tools plug-ins have been ported to the Intel-based Mac platform, we expect Pro Tools|HD demand to improve in Q4.  We've also addressed the stability issue with Pinnacle Studio 10, and are now focusing our development efforts on an upcoming release of Pinnacle Studio for the new Windows Vista operating system."
 
Revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, were $671.5 million compared to revenues of $530.5 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the first nine months of 2006 was $9.6 million, or $.22 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $15.6 million, or $.41 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. GAAP net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 includes $38.9 million of non-cash amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments. This compares to $46.8 million of acquisition-related charges including in-process research and development, restructuring costs, stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release may contain "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in
 
accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  We believe it is useful for ourselves and investors to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to assess our performance.  We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures are a meaningful measure of our operating performance and will assist investors in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis.

This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's performance.

Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock"). The Company shall record on its books the grant to the Participant of that number of RSUs granted to the Participant. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon vesting of the RSUs are referred to in these Terms and Conditions as "Shares".

The RSUs shall vest on the dates set forth in the attached Notice (each of such vesting dates being referred to as a "Vesting Date"). Except as provided in subsections 2(b) and 2(c) below, in the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company (as an employee or officer of, or an advisor or consultant to, the Company) for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, prior to the final Vesting Date following the date hereof, vesting shall cease and the Participant will have no rights with respect to any RSUs that have not then vested.

In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of death or disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), the Participant's RSUs shall vest with respect to an additional number of RSUs that would have vested during the one-year period following the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company.
(c)
          
If the Participant retires prior to the final Vesting Date, then the RSUs shall continue to vest through the final Vesting Date notwithstanding that the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company; provided, however, if the Participant, prior to the final Vesting Date, violates (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Participant and the Company, vesting shall immediately cease and the Participant will have no rights with respect to any RSUs that have not vested as of the date of the violation.
For purposes of this Section 2(c), "retirement" shall mean the cessation of employment with the Company for any reason other than "cause" by a Participant who is at least 60 years of age and who has worked continuously for the Company for the seven years immediately preceding the date of cessation of employment.

For purposes of these Terms and Conditions of the Restricted Stock Units, employment with the Company shall include employment with any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code.

The Company will distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's estate in the event that his or her death occurs after a Vesting Date but before distribution of the corresponding Shares), as soon as administratively practicable after each vesting date (each such date of distribution is hereinafter referred to as a "Settlement Date"), the Shares of Common Stock represented by RSUs that vested on such vesting date.
(b)
          
The Company shall not be obligated to issue to the Participant the Shares upon the vesting of any RSU (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
 
The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively, "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
The Company shall not be required (a) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein, or (b) to treat as owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom any such RSUs shall have been so sold or transferred.

par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") at the price per share and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Notice and the Plan.
It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code").

Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the tenth anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the date of grant as indicated in the Notice (the "Grant Date"), subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan.
(a)
          
Form of Exercise
. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4 below. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share or for fewer than ten whole shares.
(b)

provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation.
(d)
          
Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability
. If the Optionee dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "cause" as specified in paragraph (f) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of death or disability of the Optionee, by the Optionee (or in the case of death by an authorized transferee),
provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his or her death or disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.
(e)
          
Exercise Period Upon Retirement
. If the Optionee retires prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee, then:

not fully vested
on the Optionee's date of retirement, the option shall continue to vest and be exercisable through the date which is 90 days after the final vesting date set forth in the Notice (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date); and
(ii) if this option is
fully vested
on the Optionee's date of retirement, the option shall be exercisable by the Optionee for a period of one year following the date of retirement (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date).

Effect of Breach of Covenants
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above, if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 12, 2006, the independent members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's 2007 Employee Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). All employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2007, certain employees hired as a result of acquisitions and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Each eligible employee must be employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive his or her award, if any. The Board administers the Plan and may modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time at its sole discretion.
 
The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2007, as well as for individual performance and contributions.
 
Each participant's bonus payout under the Plan ("Bonus Payout") is based on three factors: the participant's "Target Award" (as defined below), the financial performance of the participant's business unit ("Business Unit Performance"), and the participant's individual performance ("Individual Performance"). Mathematically, this can be represented as:
 
Bonus Payout = Target Award X Business Unit Performance X Individual Performance
 
Target Awards range from 5% to 140% of each participant's base salary, based on various factors (determined by the Board for executive officers, and by management for all other participants), including the participant's role and position in the organizational structure of the Company.
 
As a threshold matter, the Company's operating profit for 2007 must exceed a minimum amount established by the Board for any Bonus Payout to be made to any participant.
 
For purposes of the Plan, all participants are grouped into one of four business units: corporate, audio, consumer and video. For each business unit, Business Unit Performance is measured by operating profit. Once a business unit meets a minimum operating profit threshold, as established by the Board, each participant in that business unit becomes eligible to receive a percentage of such participant's Target Award, up to 100% if the target operating profit for that business unit (an amount set by the Board which exceeds the operating profit threshold) is achieved, subject to such participant's Individual Performance. The target operating profit for the corporate business unit is the sum of the target operating profits of the Company's audio, consumer and video business units. If the corporate business unit exceeds its target operating profit, for every $1.00 of incremental profit in excess of the corporate business unit's target operating profit, an additional $0.30 is distributed among all participants whose business units exceeded their target operating profits.
 
2
 
The Business Unit Performance component of each participant's Bonus Payout is determined as follows: (1) for executive officers and corporate business unit vice presidents, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of the corporate business unit; (2) for each vice president in the audio, consumer and video business units, 75% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of that vice president's business unit and the remaining 25% is based on the corporate business unit's results; and (3) for each participant below the vice president level, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of such participant's business unit.
 
The Individual Performance component of each participant's Bonus Payout is based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other participants) of such participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company, pursuant to which a multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to such participant's Target Award.
 
Bonus Payouts under the Plan will be determined after the Company's financial results for 2007 are publicly released, which is currently anticipated to be in February 2008. Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be paid in February 2008.
 
The full text of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

2007 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN
 
On December 12, 2006, the independent members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") adopted this 2007 Employee Bonus Plan (the "Plan").
 
PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
 
The purpose of this Plan is: (1) to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and (2) to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2007, as well as for individual performance and contributions. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" includes any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.
ADMINISTRATION
The Plan is administered by the Board. The Board has the exclusive right to administer, interpret and decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan including, without limitation, the right to modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time in its sole discretion. All decisions by the Board are made in the Board's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan. No director or person acting pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board will be liable for any action or determination relating to or under the Plan made in good faith.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more executive officers of the Company such powers under the Plan as the Board may determine in its discretion, provided that the Board shall determine the Bonus Payout (as defined below) for each executive officer of the Company.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (each, a "Committee"). All references in the Plan to the "Board" means the Board or a Committee of the Board or the executive officer referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the extent that the Board's powers or authority under the Plan have been delegated to such Committee or executive officer.
 
1
 
ELIGIBILITY
 
All Company employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2007, and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must be employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive their award, if any. Each such eligible employee is deemed a "Participant" in the Plan.
 
BONUS PAYOUTS
 
A Participant's bonus payout under the Plan ("Bonus Payout") is based on three factors, each as defined below: (1) the Participant's Target Award; (2) the financial performance of the Participant's Business Unit ("Business Unit Performance"); and (3) the Participant's individual performance ("Individual Performance").
 
Target Award
. A "Participant's Target Award" is an amount between 5% and 140% of a Participant's base salary, based on various factors (as determined by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants), including the Participant's role and position within the organizational structure of the Company. The "Business Unit Target Award," for each business unit, is the sum of the Target Awards for all Participants in such business unit, as the case may be.
 
Business Unit Performance.
The Business Unit Performance component of a Participant's Bonus Payout is an objective measurement of a business unit's financial results based on operating profit, as further discussed below.
 
Individual Performance
. Based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants) of the Participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company, a multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to the Participant's Target Award in order to determine the Participant's Bonus Payout. Accordingly, this Individual Performance component may increase a Participant's Bonus Payout by as much as 20% of such Participant's Target Award or, in other circumstances, reduce the award to zero.
 
 
For purposes of the Plan, all Participants are grouped into one of four business units: Corporate, Audio, Consumer or Video. For each of the business units, Business Unit Performance is measured by operating profit. In order for a Participant to receive a bonus, operating profit for the Company and the Participant's business unit must exceed minimum amounts established by the Board, as further described below.
 
As a threshold matter, for all business units, the Company's 2007 operating profit must exceed a minimum amount established by the Board for any Bonus Payout to be made to any Participant.
 
2
 
 
Business Unit Performance is measured by operating profit. Once a business unit meets a minimum operating profit threshold ("Threshold Operating Profit"), as established by the Board, Participants in that business unit become eligible to receive a percentage of their Target Awards up to 100% if the target operating profit ("Target Operating Profit") is achieved, subject to their Individual Performance. The Target Operating Profit is an amount set by the Board which exceeds the Threshold Operating Profit and is based on the Company's operating plan for 2007. The Target Operating Profit for the Corporate business unit is the sum of the Target Operating Profits for the Audio, Consumer and Video business units.
 
If the Corporate business unit exceeds its Target Operating Profit, 30% of such excess amount (the "Over-Achievement Pool") will be added to the total bonus pool available for Participants whose business units exceed their respective Target Operating Profits (each, a "Qualifying Business Unit"). A portion of the Over-Achievement Pool calculated by multiplying the Over-Achievement Pool by a fraction (the numerator of which is the Corporate Business Unit Target Award and the denominator of which is the sum of the Business Unit Target Awards of each Qualifying Business Unit) will be allocated to the Corporate business unit. The remainder of the Over-Achievement Pool will be allocated to each non-Corporate Qualifying Business Unit in proportion to each such non-Corporate Qualifying Business Unit's contribution to the Corporate business unit's operating profit in excess of its Target Operating Profit.
 
The Business Unit Performance component of a Participant's Bonus Payout is determined as follows: (1) for executive officers of the Company and vice presidents in the Corporate business unit, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of the Corporate business unit; (2) for vice presidents in the Audio, Consumer and Video business units, 75% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their respective business units and the remaining 25% is based on the Corporate business unit results; and (3) for all Participants below the vice president level, 100% of the Business Unit Performance component is based on the results of their respective business units.
 
PRO-RATED BONUS PAYOUTS
 
Bonus Payouts may be pro-rated under the following circumstances:
 
 
3
 
TIMING OF PLAN PAYOUT
Bonus Payouts under the Plan will be determined after the Company's financial results for 2007 are publicly released, which is currently anticipated to be in February 2008. Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be paid in February 2008.
 
 
Nothing in this Plan will be construed as creating an employment relationship between a Participant and the Company, nor is the Plan intended to be a guarantee of any kind of compensation or any other binding commitment of the Company. The Company may modify Bonus Payouts or establish separate procedures for Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed outside the United States in order to comply with laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, currency, employee benefits or other matters. The provisions of this Plan and all awards made hereunder shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the rules governing conflicts of law.

Avid Reports Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
 
Tewksbury, MA
 February 1, 2007  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $239.0 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2006 compared to $245.0 million for the same period in 2005. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $52.6 million, or $1.28 per share compared to GAAP net income of $18.4 million, or $.43 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 includes a non-cash charge of $53.0 million for the impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Pinnacle Systems in August 2005. As a result of completing its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter, the company concluded that the fair value of the consumer business unit had declined below the book value, resulting in the impairment charge. 
 
In addition, the company took a restructuring charge of $3.2 million as a result of reorganizations within the Professional Video and Consumer Video segments that took place during the quarter.
 
These charges plus amortization, stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments totaled $75.1 million during the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.54. For the fourth quarter of 2005, there was $11.6 million of acquisition-related charges, including amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.69 in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
"As we look back at our performance in Q4, and the full year of 2006, it's clear that our results were mixed. While our big deal backlog continued to build each quarter throughout the year, including Q4, bringing us to record levels, recognizing revenue out of this backlog continued to be unpredictable. This led to a shortfall in our video business for the fourth quarter," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer.  "Our audio business recovered nicely from the slowdown in demand that we saw in Q3 for Digidesign's Pro Tools|HD systems, allowing a strong finish for the year. In consumer, we had lower than expected results for the year as the business was slow to recover from the product quality problems with the Studio 10 software. We took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reflect the
 
decline in the fair value of the consumer business unit. Nevertheless, we believe that the product quality problems are now behind us, and are pleased that we achieved higher-than expected consumer revenues in Q4 based on strong demand in Europe. We have taken a number of steps to position all of our businesses more favorably for the coming year, including a cost restructuring in our consumer business which took place in Q4. Graham Sharp, our new general manager for our video division, has already implemented a number of changes that are intended to improve the segment's operations. However, we do not expect the full benefits of these efforts to be realized immediately."
 
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, were $910.6 million compared to revenues of $775.4 million for 2005. GAAP net loss for 2006 was $42.9 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $34.0 million, or $.86 per diluted share, for 2005. GAAP net loss for 2006 includes $113.9 million of impairment charges, amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.67 for 2006. GAAP net income for 2005 includes $58.4 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.34 for 2005.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005 and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage our business, for example, in establishing our annual operating budget, to assess segment operating performance and for measuring performance under our employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by our management in their operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, we believe it is useful for our investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with our past financial results. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Our management compensates for these limitations by considering the Company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): April 16, 2007
 
AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.
(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On April 16, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Amended and Restated 2007 Employee Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). All employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2007, certain employees hired as a result of acquisitions and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must be employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out in order to receive an award. The Board administers the Plan and may modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time at its sole discretion.
 
The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2007, as well as for individual performance and contributions.
 
For purposes of the Plan, all participants are grouped into one of four business units: Corporate, Audio, Consumer or Video. All executive officers of the Company are included in the Corporate business unit.
 
Each participant's bonus payout under the Plan is based on three factors:
 
(1)
Target Award
. An individual's Target Award is an amount between 5% and 140% of the participant's base salary based on the participant's role within the Company. The Target Award for a business unit is the sum of the Target Awards for all participants in that business unit.
 
(2)
Business Unit Performance
. The Business Unit Performance component of a participant's bonus payout is an objective measurement of a business unit's financial results based on operating profit.
 
 
(3)
Individual Performance
. Based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other participants) of the participant's overall performance, an Individual Performance multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to the participant's Target Award in order to determine the participant's bonus payout.
 
In order for participants in the Audio, Consumer or Video business units to receive a bonus, their respective business units must achieve a minimum level of operating profit established by the Board ("Minimum Operating Profit"). Thereafter, participants in that business unit become eligible to receive
 
2
 
 
up to 100% of their Target Awards if their respective business units earn a target level of operating profit established by the Board ("Target Operating Profit").
 
In order for non-executive participants in the Corporate business unit to receive a bonus, at least one of the other three business units must attain its Minimum Operating Profit. Thereafter, non-executive participants in the Corporate business unit become eligible to receive a bonus payout based on a weighted-average of the bonus payouts earned by the other three business units.
 
In order for executive officers to receive a bonus, the Company as a whole must achieve its Minimum Operating Profit, which is the sum of the Minimum Operating Profit amounts for the Audio, Consumer and Video business units. Thereafter, executive officers become eligible to receive a bonus payout based on the same weighted-average formula used for non-executive participants in the Corporate business unit.
 
No business unit may receive a bonus payout in excess of 100% of its Target Award unless the Company as a whole achieves its Minimum Operating Profit. Thereafter, any business unit that exceeds its Target Operating Profit is eligible to receive an over-achievement payout equal to 30% of the excess operating profit earned by such business unit. A portion of such over-achievement payout will also be allocated to the Corporate business unit (based on a weighted-average formula). No business unit may receive a bonus payout in excess of 150% of its Target Award without further approval from the Board.
 
Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2008 after the Company's financial results for fiscal year 2007 are publicly announced.
 
The full text of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

AMENDED AND RESTATED 2007 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN
 
On April 16, 2007, the Board of Directors (the
"Board"
) of Avid Technology, Inc. (the
"Company"
) adopted this Amended and Restated 2007 Employee Bonus Plan (the
"Plan"
).
 
PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
 
The purpose of this Plan is: (1) to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and (2) to reward employees for helping the Company to achieve certain financial goals for 2007, as well as for individual performance and contributions. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" includes any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.
ADMINISTRATION
The Plan is administered by the Board. The Board has the exclusive right to administer, interpret and decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan including, without limitation, the right to modify, amend, revoke or suspend the Plan at any time in its sole discretion. All decisions by the Board are made in the Board's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan. No director or person acting pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board will be liable for any action or determination relating to or under the Plan made in good faith.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more executive officers of the Company such powers under the Plan as the Board may determine in its discretion, provided that the Board shall determine the bonus payout for each executive officer of the Company.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (each, a
"Committee"
). All references in the Plan to the "Board" mean the Board or a Committee of the Board or the executive officer referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the extent that the Board's powers or authority under the Plan have been delegated to such Committee or executive officer.
 
1
 
ELIGIBILITY
 
All Company employees (other than temporary employees, employees hired after September 30, 2007, and employees who are covered by a sales compensation or commission-based plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan, including all of the Company's executive officers. Eligible employees must be employed by the Company at the time awards are paid out under the Plan in order to receive an award, if any. Each eligible employee is deemed a
"Participant"
in the Plan.
 
BONUS PAYOUTS
 
For purposes of the Plan, all Participants are grouped into one of four business units: Corporate, Audio, Consumer or Video. All executive officers of the Company are included in the Corporate business unit.
 
A Participant's bonus payout under the Plan is based on three factors:
 
(1)
Target Award
. The Target Award for a Participant is an amount between 5% and 140% of the Participant's base salary, based on various factors (as determined by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants), including the Participant's role within the Company. The Target Award for a business unit is the sum of the Target Awards for all Participants in that business unit.
 
(2)
Business Unit Performance
.
The Business Unit Performance component of a Participant's bonus payout is an objective measurement of a business unit's financial results based on operating profit.
 
 
(3)
Individual Performance
. Based on the subjective evaluation (by the Board for all executive officers, and by management for all other Participants) of the Participant's overall performance and contributions to the Company, an Individual Performance multiplier ranging from 0 to 1.2 is applied to the Participant's Target Award in order to determine the Participant's bonus payout. Accordingly, the Individual Performance component may increase a Participant's bonus payout by as much as 20% of the Participant's Target Award or, in other circumstances, reduce the award to zero.
 
2
 
PLAN GOALS AND MEASUREMENT
 
In order for Participants in the Audio, Consumer or Video business units to receive a bonus, their respective business units must achieve a minimum level of operating profit established by the Board (
"Minimum Operating Profit"
). Thereafter, Participants in that business unit become eligible to receive up to 100% of their Target Awards if their respective business units earn a target level of operating profit established by the Board (
"Target Operating Profit"
).
 
In order for non-executive Participants in the Corporate business unit to receive a bonus, at least one of the other three business units must attain its Minimum Operating Profit. Thereafter, non-executive Participants in the Corporate business unit become eligible to receive a bonus payout based on a weighted-average of the bonus payouts earned by the other three business units.
 
In order for executive officer Participants to receive a bonus, the Company as a whole must achieve its Minimum Operating Profit, which is the sum of the Minimum Operating Profit amounts for the Audio, Consumer and Video business units. Thereafter, executive officer Participants become eligible to receive a bonus payout based on the same weighted-average formula used for non-executive Participants in the Corporate business unit.
 
No business unit may receive a bonus payout in excess of 100% of its Target Award unless the Company as a whole achieves its Minimum Operating Profit. Thereafter, any business unit that exceeds its Target Operating Profit is eligible to receive an over-achievement payout equal to 30% of the excess operating profit earned by such business unit. A portion of such over-achievement payout will also be allocated to the Corporate business unit (based on a weighted-average formula).
 
No business unit may receive a bonus payout in excess of 150% of its Target Award without further approval from the Board.
 
PRO-RATED BONUS PAYOUTS
 
Bonus payouts may be pro-rated under the following circumstances:
 
 
3
 
TIMING OF PLAN PAYOUT
Bonus Payouts, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2008 after the Company's financial results for fiscal year 2007 are publicly announced.
 
MISCELLANEOUS
 
Nothing in this Plan will be construed as creating an employment relationship between any Participant and the Company, nor is the Plan intended to be a guarantee of any kind of compensation or any other binding commitment of the Company. The Company may modify bonus payouts or establish separate procedures for Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed outside the United States in order to comply with laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, currency, employee benefits or other matters. The provisions of this Plan and all awards made hereunder shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the rules governing conflicts of law.

Avid Reports First Quarter 2007 Results
 
Announces Authorization to Repurchase Up To $100 Million of Stock
 
Tewksbury, MA
 April 26, 2007  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenues of $218.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2007 compared to $218.1 million for the same period in 2006. GAAP net income for the quarter was $20,000, or $.00 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006.
 
GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2007 includes $10.6 million of charges including amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.25. For the first quarter of 2006, there was $12.8 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.37 in the first quarter of 2006.
 
"Although we're pleased that our bottom-line results were at the high end of our expectations due to careful cost controls and favorable one-time tax adjustments, sustained, profitable growth is our main objective," said David Krall, Avid's president and chief executive officer. "In our professional video business, we believe that growth will come with continued focus on being at the core of our customers' businesses. In the first quarter, our overall bookings were up 9% from the same period last year, however, there was a noticeable drop-off in our run-rate business, despite the introduction of several new products late in the quarter. In discussions with our installed base, it has become clear that they are looking for us to provide them with the ability to migrate to our new solutions in stages, rather than having to do a wholesale upgrade all at one time. Therefore, in response to that feedback, we will be diverting some engineering resources to build this migration path. While this will negatively impact our ability to recognize incremental revenue out of our backlog by one to two quarters, it should have a positive impact on our run-rate business  and it's the best long-term strategy to meet the needs of our video customers."
 
 
Stock Repurchase Program
Avid also announced that its Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $100 million of stock through transactions on the open market, in block trades or otherwise. The stock repurchase program will be funded using the company's working capital. As of March 31, 2007, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $187.5 million.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarters of 2007 and 2006 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage our business, for example, in establishing our annual operating budget, to assess segment operating performance and for measuring performance under our employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by our management in their operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, we believe it is useful for our investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with our past financial results. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Our management compensates for these limitations by considering the Company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's performance.

Avid Announces Departure of CEO David Krall
 
Tewksbury, Mass.
 July 16, 2007  The board of directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that David Krall will step down from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, and board member of the company, at the end of July. Nancy Hawthorne, current board member and former chairman, will serve as the company's interim CEO as the board begins an immediate search for a new CEO. Krall will be available as a consultant to the company during the transition period.
 
"Avid Technology has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, through new technology introductions and strategic acquisitions that have broadened the company's product portfolio and bolstered its position in adjacent digital content creation markets," said Krall, who has served as president, CEO, and board member for the past seven years. "With Avid's twenty-year track record helping customers to create and distribute the world's most compelling media  and numerous opportunities to expand across an increasingly diverse marketplace, the time is right for new leadership at the helm. I'm proud to have played a role in helping Avid become a leading technology and services provider that truly powers the world of digital media and entertainment  and would like to thank every Avid employee, customer, shareholder, and business partner for the contributions they've made to the company's success."
 
Commenting on behalf of the board of directors, current chairman Pamela Lenehan, said, "David has been instrumental in transforming Avid Technology's business  and keeping it at the forefront of the digital media revolution. He has helped direct the company's efforts to revitalize its postproduction business; secure a leadership position in broadcast news production; grow its audio business through market expansion and product development; and enter the consumer video and audio markets through acquisition. His dedication and loyalty to Avid have been unwavering  and we thank him for establishing a rich foundation upon which the company can build an even brighter future."
 
Hawthorne, who currently serves as CEO of the financial advisory and investment firm, Clerestory LLC, has been a member of the Avid board of directors since 1997 and has worked closely with Krall and the
 
Avid senior management team as the company has diversified its business and more than doubled revenues in the last five years. "Nancy's knowledge of Avid's day-to-day business  plus her strong financial background and broad expertise with large companies  will serve the company well during this important leadership transition," said Lenehan. "We're fortunate to have Nancy engage in this role as we begin our search for a new CEO."
 
Previously, Hawthorne was the chief financial officer of Continental Cablevision, Inc. from 1992 to 1996, where she was responsible for treasury, mergers and acquisitions, investor relations, accounting functions, and oversaw the company's financial strategy and capital markets activities. Following Continental Cablevision's merger with US West Inc., she became an executive vice president of the merged company, MediaOne.
 
Avid, which reaffirmed its Q2 guidance of $220M to $230M in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.15 to $0.20, plans to release its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 on Thursday, July 26, 2007.

Avid Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
 
Appoints Joel Legon as CFO
 
Tewksbury, MA
 July 26, 2007  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenue of $225.3 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2007, compared to $222.2 million for the same period in 2006. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $6.0 million, or $.15 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $2.7 million, or $.06 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
 
GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2007 includes $14.2 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal settlements and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.20. For the second quarter of 2006, there was $11.8 million of amortization, stock-based compensation and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.34 in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Avid also announced the appointment of Joel Legon to serve as the company's vice president and chief financial officer. Since joining Avid in March 2006, Legon had served as vice president and corporate controller. He had additionally served as acting chief financial officer since March 2007.
 
"I am pleased to report a solid Q2, with revenue and profit that were in line with our expectations," said David Krall, who will be stepping down as president and chief executive officer on July 31. "Our Video division recognized several large deals out of backlog, including France 24, one of the largest orders in our history. In Audio, which is our most consistent and profitable segment, revenue was flat organically and up 3% year-on-year including revenue generated from Sibelius. In our Consumer segment, lower sales of the TV viewing line in Europe were counterbalanced by strong sales and market share growth of our flagship Studio 11 consumer video editor."
 
"With a strong balance sheet, innovative products and world-class customers, Avid is well positioned as a leader in the media and entertainment industry," said Nancy Hawthorne, who will take over as interim chief executive officer on August 1. "Our customers are looking to Avid to extend that leadership into new areas as their
 
businesses evolve. By aligning ourselves more closely with our customers' business opportunities, and taking a fresh approach to our own business processes, we believe we can deliver more value to both our customers and our shareholders."
 
The company also announced a strategic realignment that will result in restructuring charges of between $8 and $10 million, $1.5 million of which was recorded in Q2.

Revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007 was $444.2 million, compared to revenue of $440.3 million for the same period in 2006.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage our business, for example, in establishing our annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under our employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by our management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, we believe it is useful for our investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with our past financial results. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and
 
expense that affect our operations. Our management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Avid Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
 
Tewksbury, MA
 October 25, 2007  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenue of $226.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2007, compared to $231.2 million for the same period in 2006. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $5.9 million, or $.14 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $3.6 million, or $.08 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
 
GAAP net loss in the third quarter of 2007 includes $21.0 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, other costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.37. For the third quarter of 2006, there was $14.3 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring recoveries, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments included in GAAP net income. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.42 in the third quarter of 2006.
 
The company's cash balance increased to $197.2 million at September 30, 2007 primarily due to operating cash flow.
 
"Given the initiatives we have undertaken, we are pleased with this quarter's results," said Nancy Hawthorne, Avid's interim chief executive officer. "We remain focused on enhancing Avid's profitability by improving all aspects of the company's operations.
 
"Our professional video business had a solid quarter with stable revenue and improved profitability sequentially as we recognized some large deals from our backlog and had a modest increase in our run rate business," continued Hawthorne. "Audio performed well as strength in studio and live mixing consoles and products serving the home/hobbyist studio market offset weakness in core Pro Tools|HD upgrades and M-Audio. Finally, in consumer the PC-based TV viewing products were strong and the launch of the Studio 11 consumer video editor continued to go well."
 
Revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 was $671.1 million, compared to revenue of $671.5 million for the same period in 2006. GAAP net loss for the first nine months of 2007 was $11.8 million, or $.29 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $9.6 million, or $.22 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 includes $45.8 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, other costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.82 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2007. GAAP net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 includes $38.9 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development, and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.13 for the first nine months of 2006.

The Agreement provides that if Mr. Greenfield's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Agreement) or by Mr. Greenfield with good reason (as defined in the Agreement) other than within 12 months after a change-in-control of the company (as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Greenfield will be entitled to receive, along with certain other payments set forth in the Agreement, (i) 12 months base salary, (ii) a bonus equal to the greater of Mr. Greenfield's highest annual incentive bonus for the prior two years or 100% of his base salary plus a pro rata portion of such bonus, and (iii) reimbursement of COBRA premiums for 12 months. In addition, any time-based vesting awards held by Mr. Greenfield will vest as to an additional number of shares equal to the number of shares that would have been vested as of the end of the 12 month period following the date Mr. Greenfield's employment terminates. Mr. Greenfield will also be entitled to exercise any options for 12 months after the termination of this employment.
 
If Mr. Greenfield's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Greenfield for good reason within 12 months after a change-of-control of the Company or during a potential change-in-control period (as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Greenfield will be entitled to receive, along with certain other payments set forth in the Agreement, (i) the greater of Mr. Greenfield's highest annual incentive bonus for the prior two years or 100% of his base salary pro rated through the date Mr. Greenfield's employment terminates and (ii) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of his base salary plus the greater of Mr. Greenfield's highest annual incentive bonus for the prior two years or 100% of his base salary.

In addition, all outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards held by Mr. Greenfield will vest in full and Mr. Greenfield will be entitled to exercise any options for 18 months after the termination of this employment. Mr. Greenfield will be entitled to reimbursement of COBRA premiums for 18 months.

Following the Effective Date, Executive shall be permitted to continue serving on, and only on, the boards of directors (and committees thereof) of three companies on which Executive serves as of the Effective Date (the "Existing Directorships"); provided, however, that if Executive resigns or otherwise ceases to serve with respect to any Existing Directorship, Executive shall not serve on the boards of directors or advisory committees of more than two companies (public or private) without prior Board approval. Executive's service on the Board shall not be taken into account for purposes of the limitations set forth in this paragraph.
1.3.
        
No Conflicting Commitments
. During the Term, Executive will not undertake any commitments, engage or have an interest in any outside business activities or enter into any consulting agreements which, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors (excluding Executive), conflict with the Company's interests or which might reasonably be expected to impair the performance of Executive's duties as a full-time employee of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may pursue personal interests (including, without limitation, industry, civic and charitable activities), attend to his personal investments, so long as such activities do not interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder, and, until December 31, 2007, continue to satisfy obligations with respect to his prior employer.
1.4.
        
Board Membership

Executive's service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Upon termination of Executive's employment with the
 
 
 
Company for any reason, unless the Board affirmatively requests that Executive remain on the Board, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from the Board voluntarily as of the last day of employment with the Company; and at the Board's request, Executive will execute any documents necessary to reflect such resignation.

Term

The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2012 unless sooner terminated when the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that a Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Section 4.2.2) should occur during the calendar year 2012 and Executive is still an employee of the Company at that time, then the Term shall be deemed to expire on the date that is 12 months after the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company, (ii) in the event a Potential Change-in-Control Period (as defined in Section 4.2.6) exists at December 31, 2012 and Executive is still an employee of the Company at that date, the Term shall be deemed to expire on the date that 12 months after the commencement of such Potential Change-in-Control Period and (iii) the expiration of the Term shall not adversely affect Executive's rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Potential Change-in-Control Period shall commence in 2012 and a Change-in-Control of the Company shall also occur in 2012, and if Executive is still an employee of the Company on the date of the Change-in-Control of the Company, the Term shall be deemed to expire 12 months after the date of such Change-in-Control. Unless the services of the Executive have terminated prior to or upon the end of the Term in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, from and after the end of the Term, Executive shall be an employee-at-will.

2
 
payable under Section 3.8), shall not exceed Two Million One Hundred Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($2,115,000).
The amount of Executive's Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, shall be based on the degree to which Executive's performance objectives for a fiscal year have been met. Within 70 days after the Effective Date, Executive and the Compensation Committee of the Board (after receiving input from the Board) shall have mutually determined and established Executive's performance objectives for fiscal year 2008. Thereafter, during the Term, Executive's performance objectives for each fiscal year shall be mutually established by the Compensation Committee of the Board and Executive during Executive's annual performance review; provided, that in no event shall the percentages set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 3.2 to be used in calculating Executive's Annual Incentive Bonus be reduced. The Compensation Committee of the Board shall determine, for each fiscal year, the extent to which Executive's performance objectives for such fiscal year have been attained and the amount of the Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, for such fiscal year. Any Annual Incentive Bonus earned by Executive with respect to a fiscal year shall be paid to him promptly after the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year but in no event later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal year.

The Board (excluding Executive if he is a member of the Board) shall make the final determination of ROE and the ROE percentage point improvement for purposes hereof for each calendar year no later then the 1st day of March following the end of such calendar year.

The Company shall provide Executive, at the Company's sole cost, with full executive outplacement assistance with an agency selected by Executive (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company), provided that no outplacement benefits shall be provided after the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which Date of Termination occurs.
4.3.5.
     
Without Cause or with Good Reason During a Potential Change-in-Control Period
. If, during the existence of a Potential Change-in-Control Period, Executive shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.6 or the Company shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.4, then in any such event, subject to Section 4.6, Executive shall receive the payments, benefits and rights set forth in Sections 4.3.4(a), (b), (c) and (d), except that any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) shall be paid over the 18-month period that commences on the Date of Termination, if such date occurs more than 30 days prior to the Change-in-Control of the Company that is the subject of the Potential Change-in-Control Period; otherwise, such amount shall be paid in a lump sum on the date that such Change-in-Control of the Company occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Change-in-Control of the Company (that is the subject of the Potential Change-in-Control Period) occurs more than 30 days after the Date of Termination, and payments of the amount payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) have begun over an 18-month period, pursuant to the preceding sentence, the balance of the amount payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on the date such Change-in-Control of the Company occurs.
 
13
 
4.4.1.
     
In the event of a Change-in-Control of the Company, or other event constituting a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company, at its sole expense, shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review all payments, accelerations, distributions and benefits that have been made to or provided to, and are to be made, or may be made, to or provided to, Executive under this Agreement, and any other agreement or plan benefiting Executive (collectively the "Original Payments"), to determine the applicability of Section 4999 of the Code to Executive in connection with such event (other than under this Section 4.4). If the Company's independent auditors determine that the Original Payments are subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then an additional amount shall be paid to Executive (the "Gross-Up Amount") such that the net proceeds of the Gross-Up Amount to Executive, after deduction of the Excise Tax (including interest and penalties) upon the Gross-Up Amount, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on the Original Payments. The Company's independent auditors will perform the calculations in conformity with the foregoing provisions and will provide Executive with a copy of their calculations. The intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay, any Excise Tax on the Original Payment(s) and Gross-Up Amount and any income and employment taxes (including, without limitation, other penalties and interest on such income and employment taxes) imposed on any Gross-Up Amount payable hereunder. If no determination by the Company's independent auditors is made prior to the time Executive is required to file a tax return reflecting Excise Taxes on any portion of the Original Payment(s), Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Amount calculated on the basis of the Excise Tax that Executive reports in such tax return, within 30 days after the filing of such tax return. Executive agrees that, for the purposes of the foregoing sentence, Executive is not required to file a tax return until Executive has obtained the maximum number and length of filing extensions available, and Executive shall have provided a copy of the relevant portions of such tax return to the Company not less than 10 days prior to filing such tax return.
4.4.2.
     
If any tax authority finally determines that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed upon the Original Payments or the Gross-Up Amount than is determined by the Company's independent auditors or reflected in Executive's tax returns, Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional Gross-Up Amount calculated on the basis of the additional amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable by such tax authority (including related penalties and interest) from the Company within 30 days after such determination. Executive shall cooperate with the Company as it may reasonably request to permit the Company (at its sole expense) to contest the determination of such taxing authority to minimize the amount payable under this Section 4.4. If any tax authority finally determines the Excise Tax payable by Executive to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Amount, Executive shall repay the Company, within 30 days after Executive's receipt of a tax refund resulting from that determination, to the extent of such refund, the portion of the Gross-Up Amount attributable to such reduction (including the refunded portion of Gross-Up Amount attributable to the Excise Tax and Federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Amount being repaid, less any additional income tax resulting from receipt of
 
14
 
such refund).
4.5.1.
     
Payments to Executive under this Article 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion, if any, that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after Executive's Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made as a result of a termination under Section 4.1.1. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to Executive hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year of Executive following the taxable year of Executive in which Executive's employment with the Company terminates.
4.5.2.
     
The parties acknowledge and agree that the interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and its application to the terms of this Agreement is uncertain and may be subject to change as additional guidance and interpretations become available. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits or payments provided by the Company to Executive that would be deemed to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If, however, any such benefit or payment is deemed to not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive agree to renegotiate in good faith any such benefit or payment (including, without limitation, as to the timing of any severance payments payable hereof) so that either (i) Section 409A of the Code will not apply or (ii) compliance with Section 409A of the Code will be achieved;
provided
,
however
, that any resulting renegotiated terms shall provide to Executive the after-tax economic equivalent of what otherwise has been provided to Executive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;
provided
further
, that any deferral of payments or other benefits shall be only for such time period as may be required to comply with Section 409A; and
provided
,
further
, that payments or other benefits that occur as a result of the application of this Section 4.5.2 shall themselves comply with Section 409A of the Code.
4.5.3.
     
If Executive shall incur any liability under Section 409A of the Code or under any comparable state or local law, rule or regulation as a result of any payments or benefits that Executive receives from the Company (including, without limitation, any payments or benefits made or provided pursuant to Section 4.5.2), the Company shall pay Executive an amount (the "409A Gross-Up Amount") such that the net proceeds of the 409A Gross-Up
 
15
 
Amount to Executive, after deduction of any and all Federal, state and local taxes (including, without limitation, employment taxes, interest and penalties) upon the 409A Gross-Up Amount, shall be equal to the amount of the additional tax (and any interest and penalties) payable under Section 409A of the Code or under any comparable state or local law, rule or regulation. The 409A Gross-Up Amount shall be payable to Executive no later than 21 days after Executive has paid such tax liability.
4.6.
        
Release
. In order to be eligible to receive any of the payments or benefits under Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.3.4 or 4.3.5, Executive (or his personal representative, if applicable) shall be required to execute and deliver to the Company (without subsequent revocation) a binding severance and mutual release agreement in a form provided by and reasonably satisfactory to the Company which shall contain a release of claims by Executive substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A
.
Article 5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
5.1.
        
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
. Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of the longer of (a) one year after the date Executive's employment with the Company terminates, in the case of a termination other than within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company, (b) 18 months after the date Executive's employment with the Company terminates, in the case of a termination within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company:
5.1.1.
     
Executive will not perform services for or own an interest in (except for investments of not more than five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares or other equity interests of a company or entity in which Executive does not actively participate in management) any firm, person or other entity that competes in any geographic area with the Company in the business of the development, manufacture, promotion, distribution or sale of professional or consumer film, video or audio production tools, including, but not limited to, editing, special effects, 3D, animation, live sound, broadcast or newsroom products or systems, content-creation tools, media storage or other business or services in which the Company is engaged or plans (as evidenced by consideration by the Company's executive staff or by the Board) to engage at the time Executive's employment with the Company terminates.
5.1.2.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly assist others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is prohibited to engage by Section 5.1.1.
5.1.3.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly either alone or in association with others (a) solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company, or (b) solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any natural person who was employed by the Company at any time; provided that this Section 5.1.3 (i) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual whose employment with the Company has been terminated for a period of one year or longer or whose
 
16
 
engagement to the Company as an independent contractor has been terminated for a period of six months or longer and (ii) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual arising from such individual's affirmative response to a general recruitment effort carried out through a public solicitation or a general solicitation.
5.1.4.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly either alone or in association with others solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit, any current or future customer or supplier of the Company to cease doing business in whole or in part with the Company or otherwise adversely modify his, her or its business relationship with the Company.
5.2.
        
Reasonableness of Restrictions
. It is expressly understood and agreed that (a) although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Article 5 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Article 5 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (b) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
5.3.
        
Remedies for Breach
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 5 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive expressly agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Article 6. Miscellaneous
6.1.1.
     
Executive shall be entitled to indemnification as set forth in Article Eleventh of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which has been provided to Executive.
6.1.2.
     
A directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (or policies) shall be kept in place, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter until at least the fourth anniversary of the date the Agreement is terminated for any reason, providing coverage to Executive that is no less favorable to him in any respect (including, without limitation, with respect to scope, exclusions, amounts, and deductibles) than the coverage then being provided to any other present or former officer or director of the Company.
6.2.
        
Counsel Fees
. The Company shall pay to the Executive reimbursement for all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder
 
17

Such reimbursement payments shall be made within 15 days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.
6.3.
        
No Mitigation
. The Company agrees that, except as specifically set forth in Section 4.3.3(d) and Section 4.3.4(b) regarding COBRA premium reimbursement, (i) if Executive's employment is terminated during the term of this agreement, Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Executive by the Company and (ii) the amount of any payment provided hereunder shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive.

Greenfield (the "Optionee"), an individual residing at 9800 Bent Cross Drive, Potomac, Maryland 20854.
It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). As used herein, except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee" shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under the terms of this Agreement and the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code.

Vesting Schedule
. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the seventh (7) anniversary of the Grant Date (the "Final Exercise Date"), subject to the vesting schedule set forth below. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible, it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Sections 3 or 9.

(a)
          
One hundred thousand (100,000) shares subject to this option shall vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, with the first vesting date on March 19, 2008 and the last vesting date on December 19, 2011, as long as Executive is employed by the Company on each such vesting date;

(c)
          
One hundred fifty thousand (150,000) shares subject to this option shall vest at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following the Effective Date during which the

Three hundred twenty-five thousand (325,000) shares subject to this option (the "ROE Option Shares") shall vest in accordance with the following table, based upon improvement in the Company's Return on Equity, or ROE (as defined below), in calendar year periods, commencing with calendar year 2008. Improvements for each calendar year shall be measured against a baseline ROE for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2007 ("Baseline").
 
The Board (excluding Executive if he is a member of the Board) shall make the final determination of ROE and the ROE percentage point improvement for purposes hereof for each calendar year no later then the 1st day of March following the end of such calendar year. The determination of ROE shall be based upon the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable calendar year and the unaudited financial statements for the Baseline period. The ROE Option Shares, if any, that are not vested at the end of the seventh calendar year (2014) shall be forfeited.
"Return on Equity" or "ROE" shall be determined using the Company's published non-GAAP net income, adding the provision for income taxes and subtracting the non-GAAP related tax adjustments for the applicable period and dividing by the average common stockholder equity during the same period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROE Option Shares shall vest in full at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following December 19, 2007 during which the Common Stock, as quoted on Nasdaq (or on such other exchange as such shares may be traded), trades (without regard to the closing price) at a price per share at least four times the Exercise Price, as adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends.

Changes in Capitalization
. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, the number and class of securities and Exercise Price per share of this option shall be equitably adjusted by the Company in the manner determined by the Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the Exercise Price of and the number of shares subject to this option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such dividend), then the Optionee, if he exercises the option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend, shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon the option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such stock dividend.

In connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to this option (or any portion thereof) on such terms as the Board determines: (A) provide that this option shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent options shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (B) upon written notice to the Optionee, provide that the unexercised portion of this option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such Reorganization Event unless exercised by the Optionee within a specified period following the date of such notice, (C) provide that this option shall become exercisable, realizable or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to this option shall lapse, in whole
 
 
 
 
or in part prior to or upon such Reorganization Event, (D) in the event of a Reorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the "Acquisition Price"), make or provide for a cash payment to the Optionee equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Acquisition Price times the number of shares subject to this option (to the extent the Exercise Price does not exceed the Acquisition Price) over (y) the Exercise Price times the number of shares subject to this option in exchange for the termination of the option and any applicable tax withholdings, (E) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, this option shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of the Exercise Price and any applicable tax withholdings), and (F) any combination of the foregoing.
For purposes of clause (A) above, this option shall be considered assumed if, following consummation of the Reorganization Event, this option confers the right to purchase, for each share subject to this option immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event, the consideration (whether cash, securities or other property) received as a result of the Reorganization Event by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if the consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of this option to consist solely of common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) equivalent in value (as determined by the Board) to the per share consideration received by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization Event.
(a)
          
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision.
(b)
          
Severability
. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and each such other provision shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
(c)
          
Binding Effect
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Optionee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 7.

Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, together with the Employment Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
 
 
 
(e)
          
Compliance with Code Section 409A
. This Agreement does not, and shall not be amended so as to, provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board, at the time of amendment, specifically provides that this Agreement is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f)
          
Amendment
. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8, and except with respect to any right-to-exercise and vesting terms set forth in the Employment Agreement, the Board may amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, including but not limited to, substituting another option of the same or a different type and changing the date of exercise or realization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionee's consent to such action shall be required unless (i) the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Optionee, or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 9 and the Employment Agreement.
(g)
          
Acceleration
. The Board may at any time provide that the option shall become immediately exercisable in full or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions.

(j)
           
No Right to Employment or Other Status
. The grant of this option shall not be construed as giving the Optionee the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with the Optionee free from any liability or claim hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or provided in the Employment Agreement.
(k)
           
No Rights as Stockholder

Conditions on Delivery of Stock
. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Shares pursuant to this Agreement or to remove restrictions from Shares previously delivered until (i) all conditions of the Agreement have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such Shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Recipient has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

If and to the extent the Purchase Option is not so exercised by the giving of such a notice within such 90-day period, the Purchase Option shall automatically expire and terminate effective upon the expiration of such 90-day period.
(b)

(c)
          
After the time at which any Shares are transferred to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) above, the Company shall not pay any dividend to the Recipient on account of such Shares or permit the Recipient to exercise any of the privileges or rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, but shall, in so far as permitted by law, treat the Company as the owner of such Shares.
(d)
          
The Option Price may be payable, at the option of the Company, in cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Recipient to the Company or in cash (by check) or both.

Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event other than a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the repurchase and other rights of the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall, unless the Board determines otherwise, apply
 
- 4 -
 
 
 
 
to the cash, securities or other property that the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Reorganization Event in the same manner and to the same extent as applied to the Common Stock subject to this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event involving the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, except to the extent specifically provided otherwise herein, all restrictions and conditions on the Shares then outstanding shall automatically be deemed terminated or satisfied.
(a)

Amendment

Except with respect to any right-to-exercise and vesting terms set forth in the Employment Agreement, the Board may amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, including but not limited to, substituting another award of the same or a different type and changing the date of vesting.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to extend the time period within which any option may be exercised beyond the period specified in the applicable stock plan or under the terms of any grant, award agreement or form for exercising any right under any such plan. No other payments or benefits shall be due under this Agreement to Executive, but Executive shall be entitled to any benefits accrued or earned in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company.

Payments to the Executive under this Article 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is six (6) months and one day after Executive's Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made under Section 4.1.1. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to the Executive hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year of the Executive following the taxable year of the Executive in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs.

Article 5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
5.1.
        
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
. Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of the longer of (a) one (1) year after the Date of Termination of Executive's employment hereunder and (b) while Executive is receiving any post-employment payments by the Company:
5.1.1.
     
Executive will not engage in any activity which is competitive with any business which is now, or is at any time during Executive's employment with the Company, conducted by the Company, including without limitation becoming an employee, investor (except for passive investments of not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of, or any other equity interest in, a company or entity listed or traded on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter securities market), officer, agent, partner or director of, or other participant in, any firm, person or other entity in any geographic area that competes or plans to compete with the Company in the business of the development, manufacture, promotion, distribution or sale of professional or consumer film, video or audio production tools, including but not limited to, editing, special effects, 3D, animation, live sound, broadcast or newsroom products or systems, content-creation tools, media storage or other business or services in which the Company is engaged or plans to engage at the time of Executive's termination.
5.1.2.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly assist others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is prohibited to engage by Section 5.1.1 above.

5.1.4.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly either alone or in association with others solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit, any current or future customer or supplier of the Company to cease doing business in whole or in part with the Company or otherwise adversely modify his, her or its business relationship with the Company.
5.2.
        
Reasonableness of Restrictions
. It is expressly understood and agreed that (a) although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Article 5 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Article 5 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (b) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
6
 
5.3.
        
Remedies for Breach
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 5 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions or any other equitable remedy which may then be available. Executive hereby irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit, or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement.

5.4.
        
Survival
. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or Executive's services hereunder for any reason, this Article 5 shall survive any such termination.

Obligation of Successors
.

"Good Reason" shall mean (i) a material diminution in Executive's authority, duties or responsibility from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, without Executive's express written consent; (ii) a material diminution in Executive's Base Salary as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to time, without Executive's express written consent, other than a reduction which is part of an across-the-board proportionate reduction in the salaries of all senior executives of the Company imposed because the Company is experiencing financial hardship (provided such reduction is not more than 20% and does not continue for more than twelve (12) months); (iii) a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom Executive reports, including a requirement that Executive report to a corporate officer or employee other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer, without Executive's express written consent; (iv) a material diminution in the budget over which Executive retains authority, without Executive's express written consent; (v) a material change in Executive's office location as in effect on the date hereof, without Executive's express written consent; and (vi) any material breach of this Agreement by the Company; provided, however, that a termination for Good Reason by Executive can occur only if (i) Executive has given the Company a notice of the existence of a condition giving rise to Good Reason within ninety (90) days after the initial occurrence of the condition giving rise to Good Reason and (ii) the Company has not cured the condition giving rise to Good Reason within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to extend the time period within which any option may be exercised beyond the period specified in the applicable stock plan or under the terms of any grant, award agreement or form for exercising any right under any such plan. No other payments or benefits shall be due under this Agreement to Executive, but Executive shall be entitled to any benefits accrued or earned in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company.
4.2.4.
     
Payments to the Executive under this Article 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is six (6) months and one day after Executive's Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made under Section 4.1.1. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to the Executive hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year of the Executive following the taxable year of the Executive in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs.

Exhibit 10.4
Change-in-Control Agreement
 
Date: December 18, 2007

Avid Technology, Inc.
Avid Technology Park
One Park West
Tewksbury, MA 01876
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. ("Avid" or the "Company") recognizes that your contributions to the future growth and success of the Company will be substantial and the Board desires to assure the Company of your continued services for the benefit of the Company, particularly in the face of a change-in-control of the Company.
This letter agreement ("Agreement") therefore sets forth those benefits that the Company will provide to you in the event your employment within the Company is terminated after a "Change-in-Control of the Company" (as defined in Paragraph 2(i)) under the circumstances described below.
If a Change-in-Control of the Company should occur while you are still an employee of the Company, then this Agreement shall continue in effect from the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company for so long as you remain an employee of the Company, but in no event for more than twelve (12) months following such Change-in-Control of the Company; provided, however, that the expiration of the term of this Agreement shall not adversely affect your rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. If no Change-in-Control of the Company occurs before your status as an employee of the Company is terminated, this Agreement shall expire on such date. Prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, (a) your employment may be terminated by the Company or by you, in each case only in accordance with the provisions of your Executive Employment Agreement dated the date hereof, and (b) this Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon written notice to you, and in either such event (termination of your employment, or termination of this Agreement, prior to a Change-in-Control), you shall not be entitled to any of the benefits provided hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement following the occurrence of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Paragraph 2(ii)) unless (a) at least one year has expired since the most recent event or transaction constituting a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company and (b) in respect of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company which previously occurred, no facts or circumstances continue to exist which, if initially occurring at the time any termination of this Agreement is to occur, would constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company.

(i)
           
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred only if any of the following events occur:
(a)
          
The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))(a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this Paragraph 2(i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which satisfies the criteria set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 2(i); or
(b)
          
Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequently to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c)
          
Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 40% of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (which as used in this Paragraph 2(i)(c) shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be and (B) no Person (excluding any corporation

resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination, or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation.
(ii)
          
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Potential Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company shall enter into a merger, acquisition or similar agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change-in-Control of the Company, or (B) any person shall publicly announce an intention to take actions which if consummated would constitute a Change-in-Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any event or transaction which would otherwise constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company shall not constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company if the negotiations or other actions leading to such event or transaction were initiated by the Company (it being understood that the occurrence of such a Company-initiated event or transaction shall not affect the existence of any Potential Change-in-Control of the Company resulting from any other event or transaction).
If a Change-in-Control of the Company shall have occurred while you are still an employee of the Company, you shall be entitled to the payments and benefits provided in Paragraph 4 hereof upon the subsequent termination of your employment within twelve (12) months after such Change-in-Control, by you or by the Company, unless such termination is (a) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below) or (b) by you other than for "Good Reason" (as defined below); in either such event, you shall not be entitled to receive benefits under this Agreement.
(i)
           
"
Disability
". If, as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall have been deemed "disabled" by the institution appointed by the Company to administer the Company's Long-Term Disability Plan (or successor plan) because you shall have been absent from full-time performance of your duties with the Company for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days during a three hundred and sixty-five (365) day period, the Company may terminate your employment for Disability.
(ii)
          
"
Cause
". For the purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have "Cause" to terminate your employment only upon
(A)
         
the willful and continued failure by you substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any failure resulting from your terminating your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below)) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or

(B)
         
a breach of the Company's employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreement, between you and the Company, which is not cured after ten (10) days' written notice from the Company (if such breach is susceptible to cure), or
(C)
         
the willful engaging by you in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, or

(F)
          
failing or refusing to cooperate as reasonably requested in any internal or external investigation of any matter in which the Company has a material interest (financial or otherwise) in the outcome of the investigation.
For purposes of this Paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.
(iii)
        
"
Good Reason
". You may terminate your employment for Good Reason. For purpose of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

a material diminution in your base salary in effect immediately prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, without your express written consent, other than the reduction of up to 20% for a period of not more than six (6) months which is part of an across the board proportionate reduction in the salaries of other peer executives of the Company imposed because the Company is experiencing financial hardship;
(C)
         
a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom you report, including a requirement that you report to a corporate officer or employee other than Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer, without your express written consent;

A termination pursuant to subparagraph (iii) above can occur only if you deliver a Notice of Termination to the Company within ninety (90) days after the initial occurrence of the condition giving rise to Good Reason and the Company has not cured such condition within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Notice of Termination.

for the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs.
(B)
         
For an eighteen (18) month period after such termination, the Company shall arrange to provide you with dental and group health insurance benefits substantially similar to those that you were receiving immediately prior to such termination to the extent that the Company's plans then permit the Company to provide you with such benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not provide any such benefits to you to the extent that an equivalent benefit is received by you from another employer during such period, and you shall report any such benefit actually received by you to the Company;
(C)
         
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable stock option or restricted stock agreement, the exercisability of all outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards then held by you for the purchase of common stock of the Company (or securities exchanged for such common stock in connection with the Change-in-Control of the Company) shall accelerate in full and you shall be entitled to exercise any such options until eighteen (18) months after the Date of Termination;
(D)
         
The Company shall continue to indemnify you against all claims related to actions arising prior to the termination of your employment to the fullest extent permitted by law;
(E)
          
For forty-eight (48) months from the Date of Termination, the Company or its successor shall continue to provide coverage under a directors' and officers' insurance policy, or an equivalent thereto, so long as the Board of Directors in good faith shall determine that the cost of such coverage is reasonable and that such coverage is available; and

(vi)
         
You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Paragraph 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor, except as provided in Paragraph 4(iv)(B), shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Paragraph 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.
(vii)
       
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit your continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company to its employees

and for which you may qualify nor, subject to Paragraph 11 hereof, shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as you may have under any contract or agreement between you and the Company; provided, however, that to the extent you are entitled to receive any payments hereunder upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any payments under any severance plan, program, policy or practice of the Company then in effect.
(viii)
      
Payments to you under this Paragraph 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is 6 months and one day after your Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made on account of your death. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to you hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which your termination of employment occurs.
(i)
           
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to you or for your benefit and/or any acceleration of vesting of any options or restricted stock awards (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable or provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Payments shall be reduced, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5(i), if it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate present value (determined in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations) of the payments eliminated pursuant to the preceding sentence (the "Eliminated Payments") exceeds by at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)(ii) the aggregate present value of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by you if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to you (including state and federal income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, any Excise Tax, and any withholding taxes) then no reduction in the Payments shall be made.

under this Paragraph 5, including whether any Payments need to be reduced or eliminated and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by such certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group affecting the Change of Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.
(i)
           
The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or the assets of the Company, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Paragraph 6 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
(ii)
          
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If you should die while any amounts would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to your estate.
(i)
           
The Company owns and has developed and compiled at great cost and expense, and will continue to so develop and compile, certain trade secrets, proprietary techniques and other Proprietary Information (as defined in the Company's employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreement) which have great value to the business of the Company and which gives the Company or any affiliate of the Company a competitive advantage over those who do not know the secrets or information.

Exhibit 10.5
  
Change-in-Control Agreement
 
 
Joel E. Legon
Avid Technology, Inc.
Avid Technology Park
One Park West
Tewksbury, MA 01876
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. ("Avid" or the "Company") recognizes that your contributions to the future growth and success of the Company will be substantial and the Board desires to assure the Company of your continued services for the benefit of the Company, particularly in the face of a change-in-control of the Company.
This letter agreement ("Agreement") therefore sets forth those benefits that the Company will provide to you in the event your employment within the Company is terminated after a "Change-in-Control of the Company" (as defined in Paragraph 2(i)) under the circumstances described below.
If a Change-in-Control of the Company should occur while you are still an employee of the Company, then this Agreement shall continue in effect from the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company for so long as you remain an employee of the Company, but in no event for more than twelve (12) months following such Change-in-Control of the Company; provided, however, that the expiration of the term of this Agreement shall not adversely affect your rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. If no Change-in-Control of the Company occurs before your status as an employee of the Company is terminated, this Agreement shall expire on such date. Prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, (a) your employment may be terminated by the Company or by you, in each case only in accordance with the provisions of your Executive Employment Agreement dated the date hereof, and (b) this Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon written notice to you, and in either such event (termination of your employment, or termination of this Agreement, prior to a Change-in-Control), you shall not be entitled to any of the benefits provided hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement following the occurrence of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Paragraph 2(ii)) unless (a) at least one year has expired since the most recent event or transaction constituting a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company and (b) in respect of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company which previously occurred, no facts or circumstances continue to exist which, if initially occurring at the time any termination of this Agreement is to occur, would constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company.

(i)
           
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred only if any of the following events occur:
(a)
          
The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))(a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this Paragraph 2(i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which satisfies the criteria set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 2(i); or
(b)
          
Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequently to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c)
          
Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 40% of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (which as used in this Paragraph 2(i)(c) shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be and (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns,
 
Joel E. Legon

directly or indirectly, 30% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination, or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation.
(ii)
          
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Potential Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company shall enter into a merger, acquisition or similar agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change-in-Control of the Company, or (B) any person shall publicly announce an intention to take actions which if consummated would constitute a Change-in-Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any event or transaction which would otherwise constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company shall not constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company if the negotiations or other actions leading to such event or transaction were initiated by the Company (it being understood that the occurrence of such a Company-initiated event or transaction shall not affect the existence of any Potential Change-in-Control of the Company resulting from any other event or transaction).
If a Change-in-Control of the Company shall have occurred while you are still an employee of the Company, you shall be entitled to the payments and benefits provided in Paragraph 4 hereof upon the subsequent termination of your employment within twelve (12) months after such Change-in-Control, by you or by the Company, unless such termination is (a) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below) or (b) by you other than for "Good Reason" (as defined below); in either such event, you shall not be entitled to receive benefits under this Agreement.
(i)
           
"
Disability
". If, as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental illness, you shall have been deemed "disabled" by the institution appointed by the Company to administer the Company's Long-Term Disability Plan (or successor plan) because you shall have been absent from full-time performance of your duties with the Company for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days during a three hundred and sixty-five (365) day period, the Company may terminate your employment for Disability.
(ii)
          
"
Cause
". For the purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have "Cause" to terminate your employment only upon
(A)
         
the willful and continued failure by you substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any failure resulting from your terminating your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below)) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or
(B)
         
a breach of the Company's employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreement, between you and the Company, which is not cured after ten (10) days'

written notice from the Company (if such breach is susceptible to cure), or

conviction of a felony or any other crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude, or
(F)
          
failing or refusing to cooperate as reasonably requested in any internal or external investigation of any matter in which the Company has a material interest (financial or otherwise) in the outcome of the investigation.
For purposes of this Paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.
(iii)
        
"
Good Reason
". You may terminate your employment for Good Reason. For purpose of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
(A)
         
a material diminution in your authority, duties or responsibility from those in effect immediately prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, without your express written consent;
(B)
         
a material diminution in your base salary in effect immediately prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, without your express written consent, other than the reduction of up to 20% for a period of not more than six (6) months which is part of an across the board proportionate reduction in the salaries of other peer executives of the Company imposed because the Company is experiencing financial hardship;

(C)

You shall be entitled to full executive outplacement assistance with an agency selected by the Company' provided that no outplacement assistance will be provided after the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which your Date of Termination occurred.
(v)
          
In order to be eligible to receive any of the salary or benefits under Paragraphs 4(iii) or 4(iv), you or your personal representative shall be required to execute and deliver to the Company (without subsequent revocation if provided for therein) a general release of claims against the Company, excluding any claims concerning the Company's obligations under this Agreement.
(vi)
         
You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Paragraph 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor, except as provided in Paragraph 4(iv)(B), shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Paragraph 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.
(vii)
       
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit your continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company to its employees and for which you may qualify nor, subject to Paragraph 11 hereof, shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as you may have under any contract or agreement between you and the Company; provided, however, that to the extent you are entitled to receive any payments hereunder upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any payments under any severance plan, program, policy or practice of the Company then in effect.

(viii)
      
Payments to you under this Paragraph 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is 6 months and one day after your Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made on account of your death. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to you hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which your termination of employment occurs.
(i)
           
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to you or for your benefit and/or any acceleration of vesting of any options or restricted stock awards (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable or provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Payments shall be reduced, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5(i), if it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate present value (determined in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations) of the payments eliminated pursuant to the preceding sentence (the "Eliminated Payments") exceeds by at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)(ii) the aggregate present value of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by you if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to you (including state and federal income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, any Excise Tax, and any withholding taxes) then no reduction in the Payments shall be made.
(ii)
          
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 5(i), all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph 5, including whether any Payments need to be reduced or eliminated and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by such certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group affecting the Change of Control, the Company shall
 
Joel E. Legon

appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.
(i)
           
The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or the assets of the Company, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Paragraph 6 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
(ii)
          
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If you should die while any amounts would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to your estate.
(i)
           
Unless the Company materially breaches this Agreement, you agree you will not while you are employed by the Company and for a period of eighteen (18) months after termination of your employment with the Company:

(ii)
          
It is expressly understood and agreed that (A) although you and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 7 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Paragraph 7 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (B) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.

Exhibit 10.6
  
Change-in-Control Agreement

Avid Technology, Inc.
Avid Technology Park
One Park West
Tewksbury, MA 01876
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. ("Avid" or the "Company") recognizes that your contributions to the future growth and success of the Company will be substantial and the Board desires to assure the Company of your continued services for the benefit of the Company, particularly in the face of a change-in-control of the Company.
This letter agreement ("Agreement") therefore sets forth those benefits that the Company will provide to you in the event your employment within the Company is terminated after a "Change-in-Control of the Company" (as defined in Paragraph 2(i)) under the circumstances described below.
If a Change-in-Control of the Company should occur while you are still an employee of the Company, then this Agreement shall continue in effect from the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company for so long as you remain an employee of the Company, but in no event for more than twelve (12) months following such Change-in-Control of the Company; provided, however, that the expiration of the term of this Agreement shall not adversely affect your rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. If no Change-in-Control of the Company occurs before your status as an employee of the Company is terminated, this Agreement shall expire on such date. Prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, (a) your employment may be terminated by the Company or by you, in each case only in accordance with the provisions of your Executive Employment Agreement dated the date hereof, and (b) this Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon written notice to you, and in either such event (termination of your employment, or termination of this Agreement, prior to a Change-in-Control), you shall not be entitled to any of the benefits provided hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement following the occurrence of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Paragraph 2(ii)) unless (a) at least one year has expired since the most recent event or transaction constituting a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company and (b) in respect of a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company which previously occurred, no facts or circumstances continue to exist which, if initially occurring at the time any termination of this Agreement is to occur, would constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company.

(i)
           
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred only if any of the following events occur:
(a)
          
The acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))(a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this Paragraph 2(i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which satisfies the criteria set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 2(i); or
(b)
          
Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequently to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c)
          
Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 40% of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (which as used in this Paragraph 2(i)(c) shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be and (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns,

directly or indirectly, 30% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination, or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation.
(ii)
          
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Potential Change-in-Control of the Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Company shall enter into a merger, acquisition or similar agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change-in-Control of the Company, or (B) any person shall publicly announce an intention to take actions which if consummated would constitute a Change-in-Control of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any event or transaction which would otherwise constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company shall not constitute a Potential Change-in-Control of the Company if the negotiations or other actions leading to such event or transaction were initiated by the Company (it being understood that the occurrence of such a Company-initiated event or transaction shall not affect the existence of any Potential Change-in-Control of the Company resulting from any other event or transaction).
If a Change-in-Control of the Company shall have occurred while you are still an employee of the Company, you shall be entitled to the payments and benefits provided in Paragraph 4 hereof upon the subsequent termination of your employment within twelve (12) months after such Change-in-Control, by you or by the Company, unless such termination is (a) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below) or (b) by you other than for "Good Reason" (as defined below); in either such event, you shall not be entitled to receive benefits under this Agreement.

(ii)
          
"
Cause
". For the purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have "Cause" to terminate your employment only upon
(A)
         
the willful and continued failure by you substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any failure resulting from your terminating your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below)) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or

(iii)

a material diminution in your base salary in effect immediately prior to a Change-in-Control of the Company, without your express written consent, other than the reduction of up to 20% for a period of not more than six (6) months which is part of an across the board proportionate reduction in the salaries of other peer executives of the Company imposed because the Company is experiencing financial hardship;

(vii)
       
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit your continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company to its employees and for which you may qualify nor, subject to Paragraph 11 hereof, shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as you may have under any contract or agreement between you and the Company; provided, however, that to the extent you are entitled to receive any payments hereunder upon termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any payments under any severance plan, program, policy or practice of the Company then in effect.

Payments to you under this Paragraph 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and a portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is 6 months and one day after your Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"); provided that this sentence does not apply to payments made on account of your death. Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to you hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which your termination of employment occurs.
(i)
           
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to you or for your benefit and/or any acceleration of vesting of any options or restricted stock awards (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable or provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Payments shall be reduced, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 5(i), if it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate present value (determined in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations) of the payments eliminated pursuant to the preceding sentence (the "Eliminated Payments") exceeds by at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)(ii) the aggregate present value of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by you if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to you (including state and federal income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, any Excise Tax, and any withholding taxes) then no reduction in the Payments shall be made.
(ii)
          
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 5(i), all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph 5, including whether any Payments need to be reduced or eliminated and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by such certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group affecting the Change of Control, the Company shall

appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.
(i)

(ii)
          
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

(i)
           
The Company owns and has developed and compiled at great cost and expense, and will continue to so develop and compile, certain trade secrets, proprietary techniques and other Proprietary Information (as defined in the Company's employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreement) which have great value to the business of the Company and which gives the Company or any affiliate of the Company a competitive advantage over those who do not know the secrets or information.

Dear Board Members:
 
Now that we have completed the task of finding an outstanding CEO, and as we begin a new chapter for Avid, it is a particularly appropriate time for me to move to my next set of challenges as well.  As such, I hereby tender my resignation to the Board, effective immediately.
 
We have accomplished much together in my seven years on the Board, and I believe that Avid is poised to accomplish even more.  Avid continues to lead in its core markets, is sound financially, has innovative technology, and great employees.  The company has many opportunities ahead and as we have discussed in the past, this is a good opportunity to bring in new Board members with different perspectives.
 
I will continue to value the relationships I have built with the Board and with the management team of Avid, and I'm grateful for the experiences I have had in being part of the Avid family.  As a former Board member and ongoing shareholder, I wish you all the best of luck.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(c)           
Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") appointed Kenneth A. Sexton as Chief Administrative Officer of the Company effective January 21, 2008. In this role, Mr. Sexton will oversee all of the Company's administrative functions, including finance, information technology, legal, human resources and investor relations.
 
In 2007, Mr. Sexton, age 53, served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of webMethods, Inc., a provider of business integration software solutions. In 2006, Mr. Sexton served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Infor, Inc., an enterprise software company.

From 2002 to 2004, Mr. Sexton was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Peregrine Systems, Inc., an infrastructure management software company.
 
In connection with his joining the Company, Mr. Sexton and the Company entered into an executive employment agreement (the "Agreement"), with an initial term ending on January 21, 2011. The term of the Agreement will be automatically extended for periods of one year each if neither Mr. Sexton nor the Company provides written notice to the other party of its intent to terminate at least 180 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The term will also be automatically extended in the event of a change-in-control of the Company (as defined in the Agreement) or a potential change-in-control of the Company (as defined in the Agreement) occurring in the 12-month period prior to the end of the then-current term. Under the Agreement, Mr. Sexton is entitled to receive:
 
 - 
              
an annual base salary of $375,000;
 
 - 
              
a monthly allowance of $6,000 for travel and living expenses; and
 
 - 
              
an annual incentive bonus based on achievement of performance objectives to be developed and determined by Mr. Sexton, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. For the year ending December 31, 2008, Mr. Sexton will be eligible to receive an annual bonus equal to between 100% and 135% of his base salary as of the end of such year.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, on January 28, 2008, the Company will grant to Mr. Sexton:
 
 - 
              
50,000 restricted stock units, with each unit representing the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock units will vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, as long as Mr. Sexton is still employed by the Company on each such vesting date; and
 
 - 
              
a stock option to purchase 260,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which will have a seven-year term and an exercise price per share equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 28, 2008. The stock option will vest as follows:

 - 
              
50,000 shares of the stock option will vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, as long as Mr. Sexton is still employed by the Company on each such vesting date;
 
 - 
             
100,000 shares of the stock option will vest on a performance-based schedule tied to the Company's stock price; and
 
 - 
             
110,000 shares of the stock option will vest on a performance-based schedule tied to both the Company's stock price and the achievement of certain financial metrics.
 
The Agreement provides that if Mr. Sexton's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Agreement) or by Mr. Sexton with good reason (as defined in the Agreement) other than within 12 months after a change-in-control of the Company, Mr. Sexton will be entitled to receive, along with certain other payments set forth in the Agreement, (i) 12 months base salary, (ii) a bonus equal to his target award multiplied by the applicable actual bonus plan payout factor and pro rated by the number of months Mr. Sexton was employed by the Company during the year of the date of termination, provided that the bonus will be paid only if the Company pays bonuses, on account of the year in which the date of termination occurred, to executives who remain employed with the Company, and (iii) 12 months medical and other benefits as are generally made available by the Company to its full-time executive officers. In addition, any time-based vesting awards held by Mr. Sexton will vest as to an additional number of shares equal to the number of shares that would have been vested as of the end of the 12-month period following the date Mr. Sexton's employment terminates. Mr. Sexton will also be entitled to exercise any options for 12 months after the termination of his employment.
 
If Mr. Sexton's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Sexton for good reason within 12 months after a change-in-control of the Company or during a potential change-in-control period, Mr. Sexton will be entitled to receive, along with certain other payments set forth in the Agreement, (i) the greater of Mr. Sexton's highest annual incentive bonus for the prior two years or 100% of his base salary pro rated through the date Mr. Sexton's employment terminates, and (ii) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of his base salary plus the greater of Mr. Sexton's highest annual incentive bonus for the prior two years or 100% of his base salary. In the case of a termination after a change-in-control of the Company, the foregoing amounts will be made in a lump sum payment, and, in the case of a termination during a potential change-in-control, they will be paid over the 18-month period commencing on the termination of employment. In addition, all outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards held by Mr. Sexton will vest in full, and Mr. Sexton will be entitled to exercise any options for 18 months after the termination of his employment. Mr. Sexton will be entitled to reimbursement of COBRA premiums for 18 months. Mr. Sexton will also be entitled to certain tax gross-up payments if he is subject to excise taxes in the event of a change-in-control of the Company.
 
In the event of his death or disability (as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Sexton will be entitled to 12 months base salary and any time-based vesting awards held by Mr. Sexton will vest as to an additional number of shares equal to the number of shares that would have been vested as of the end of the 12-month period following the date Mr. Sexton's employment terminates.
 
The Agreement contains non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that will restrict Mr. Sexton from engaging in activities competitive with the business of the Company or soliciting persons that were employed by or engaged with the Company for a period of 12 months in connection with a termination other than in connection with a change-in-control and 18 months in connection with a termination after a change-in-control.

Exhibit 10.1
EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.
This Executive Employment Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of January 21, 2008, by and between Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices at Avid Technology Park, One Park West, Tewksbury, Massachusetts 01876 (the "Company"), and Kenneth A. Sexton ("Executive").
Article 1. Services
1.1.
        
Service
. Commencing on January 21, 2008 (the "Effective Date") and throughout the Term (as defined below), Executive shall serve as Chief Administrative Officer of the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth below.
1.2.
        
Duties
. During the Term, Executive agrees to perform such executive duties consistent with his position as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board" or "Board of Directors") and the Chief Executive Officer and to devote his full working time and attention to such duties.
Following the Effective Date, Executive shall be permitted to serve on the board of directors (and committees thereof) of one company (public or private) with the prior approval of the Board.
1.3.
        
No Conflicting Commitments
. During the Term, Executive will not undertake any commitments, engage or have an interest in any outside business activities or enter into any consulting agreements which, in the good faith determination of the Chief Executive Officer, conflict with the Company's interests or which might reasonably be expected to impair the performance of Executive's duties as a full-time employee of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may pursue personal interests (including, without limitation, industry, civic and charitable activities) and attend to his personal investments, so long as such activities do not interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder.
Article 2. Term
2.1.
        
Term
. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on January 21, 2011 unless the Term is:
2.1.1
      
extended pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.1; or
2.1.2
      
terminated when the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term shall continue to automatically be extended for periods of one (1) year so long as neither party provides written notice to the other of its intent to terminate by a date which is at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the then-current expiration date of the Agreement, and, provided further that (i) in the event
 
 
that a Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Section 4.2.2) should occur during the 12 months prior to the end of the then-current Term and Executive is still an employee of the Company at that time, then the Term shall be deemed to expire on the date that is 12 months after the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company, (ii) in the event a Potential Change-in-Control Period (as defined in Section 4.2.6) exists within the 12 months prior to the end of the then-current Term and Executive is still an employee of the Company as of that date, the Term shall be deemed to expire on the date that is 12 months after the commencement of such Potential Change-in-Control Period and (iii) the expiration of the Term shall not adversely affect Executive's rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Potential Change-in-Control Period shall commence in the 12 months prior to the end of the then-current Term and a Change-in-Control of the Company shall also occur during such 12 month period, and if Executive is still an employee of the Company on the date of the Change-in-Control of the Company, the Term shall be deemed to expire 12 months after the date of such Change-in-Control. Unless the services of the Executive have terminated prior to or upon the end of the Term in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, from and after the end of the Term, Executive shall be an employee-at-will.
Article 3. Payments
3.1.
        
Base Compensation
. During the Term, the Company shall pay Executive an annual base salary (the "Base Salary") of Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($375,000), payable in regular installments in accordance with the Company's usual payment practices. The Base Salary shall be reviewed by the Board of Directors' Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") during the Term.
3.2.
        
Incentive Payments
. Commencing with the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 and thereafter during the remainder of the Term, Executive shall be eligible to participate in an annual performance bonus plan pursuant to which he shall be eligible to receive a target annual bonus (the "Annual Incentive Bonus") equal to One Hundred percent (100%) of his then Base Salary for full attainment of his performance objectives (which may include company-wide objectives), with a maximum annual bonus equal to One Hundred Thirty-Five percent (135%) of his then Base Salary for extraordinary performance on all or nearly all of his performance objectives. The total cash compensation payable to Executive with respect to fiscal year 2008 (excluding any payments made pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof), including his Annual Incentive Bonus for 2008, shall not exceed Eight Hundred Eighty-One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($881,250).
The amount of Executive's Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, shall be based on the degree to which Executive's performance objectives for a fiscal year have been met. Within 45 days after the Effective Date, Executive, the Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee shall have collectively determined and established Executive's performance objectives for fiscal year 2008. Thereafter, during the Term, Executive's performance objectives for each fiscal year shall be collectively established by the Compensation Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive during Executive's annual performance review; provided, that in no event shall the percentages set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 3.2 to be used in calculating Executive's Annual Incentive Bonus be reduced. The Compensation Committee shall determine, for each fiscal year, the extent to which Executive's performance objectives for
 
2
 
such fiscal year have been attained and the amount of the Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, for such fiscal year. Any Annual Incentive Bonus earned by Executive with respect to a fiscal year shall be paid to him promptly after the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year but in no event later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal year. The amount of, and Executive's entitlement to receive, the Annual Incentive Bonus for a fiscal year shall be determined without regard to whether Executive is employed on the date that such Annual Incentive Bonus is payable.
3.3.1.
     
Option Grant
. Effective as of January 28, 2008 (the "Grant Date"), pursuant to a stock option agreement, Executive will be awarded an option to purchase Two Hundred Sixty Thousand (260,000) shares of Avid Technology, Inc. common stock (the "Stock Option"). The exercise price will be the closing price of the stock on the Grant Date.
a)
     
Fifty Thousand (50,000) shares of the Stock Option will vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months ending on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date, as long as Executive is employed by the Company on each such vesting date.

(1)
    
Fifty Thousand (50,000) shares of the Stock Option will vest at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following the Grant Date during which the common stock of the Company, as quoted on Nasdaq (or on such other exchange as such shares may be traded), trades (without regard to the closing price) at a price per share of at least $50.84, as adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends; and

The Board shall make the final determination of ROE and the ROE percentage point improvement for purposes hereof for each calendar year no later then the 1st day of March following the end of such calendar year.

e)
     
the Company shall provide Executive, at the Company's sole cost, with full executive outplacement assistance with an agency selected by Executive (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company), provided that no outplacement benefits shall be provided after the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs;

. If, within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company, Executive shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.6 or the Company shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.4, then in any such event, subject to Section 4.6:

b)
    
if Executive is eligible to receive and elects to continue receiving any group medical and dental insurance coverage under COBRA, the Company shall reimburse the monthly COBRA premium (on a fully grossed up basis, if such reimbursement is taxable to Executive) in an amount equal to the portion of such premium that the Company pays on behalf of active and similarly situated employees receiving the same type of coverage until the earlier of (x) the date that is 18 months after the Date of Termination or (y) the date on which Executive becomes eligible to receive group medical and dental insurance benefits from another employer that are substantially equivalent (including, without limitation, equivalent as to benefits, premiums and co-pay amounts) to those provided

c)
     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable stock option or restricted stock unit agreement (including, without limitation, the agreements evidencing the Stock Option and the Restricted Stock Unit Grant), the exercisability of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other equity participation rights (including the right to receive restricted stock pursuant to the Restricted Stock Unit Grant or other instrument) then held by Executive with respect to the common stock of the Company (or securities exchanged for such common stock in connection with the Change-in-Control of the Company) shall accelerate in full and Executive shall be entitled to exercise any such options or other awards or equity appreciation rights until 18 months after the Date of Termination; and

4.3.5.
     
Without Cause or with Good Reason During a Potential Change-in-Control Period
. If, during the existence of a Potential Change-in-Control Period, Executive shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.6 or the Company shall terminate Executive's employment pursuant to Section 4.1.4, then in any such event, subject to Section 4.6, Executive shall receive the payments, benefits and rights set forth in Sections 4.3.4, except that any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) shall be paid over the 18-month period that commences on the Date of Termination, if such date occurs more than 30 days prior to the Change-in-Control of the Company that is the subject of the Potential Change-in-Control Period; otherwise, such amount shall be paid in a lump sum on the date that such Change-in-Control of the Company occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Change-in-Control of the Company (that is the subject of the Potential Change-in-Control Period) occurs more than 30 days after the Date of Termination, and payments of the amount payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) have begun over an 18-month period, pursuant to the preceding sentence, the balance of the amount payable pursuant to Section 4.3.4(a)(ii) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on the date such Change-in-Control of the Company occurs.
4.4.1.
     
In the event of a Change-in-Control of the Company, or other event constituting a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company, at its sole expense, shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review all payments, accelerations, distributions
 
12
 
and benefits that have been made to or provided to, and are to be made, or may be made, to or provided to Executive under this Agreement, and any other agreement or plan benefiting Executive (collectively the "Original Payments"), to determine the applicability of Section 4999 of the Code to Executive in connection with such event (other than under this section). If the Company's independent auditors determine that the Original Payments are subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then an additional amount shall be paid to Executive (the "Gross-Up Amount") such that the net proceeds of the Gross-Up Amount to Executive, after deduction of the Excise Tax (including interest and penalties) upon the Gross-Up Amount and after deductions for income and employment taxes attributable to the Gross-Up Amount, shall be equal to the Excise Tax on the Original Payments. The Company's independent auditors will perform the calculations in conformity with the foregoing provisions and will provide Executive with a copy of their calculations. The intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay, any Excise Tax on the Original Payment(s) and Gross-Up Amount and any income and employment taxes (including, without limitation, other penalties and interest on such income and employment taxes) imposed on any Gross-Up Amount payable hereunder. If no determination by the Company's independent auditors is made prior to the time Executive is required to file a tax return reflecting Excise Taxes on any portion of the Original Payment(s), Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Amount calculated on the basis of the Excise Tax that Executive reports in such tax return within 30 days after the filing of such tax return. Executive agrees that, for the purposes of the foregoing sentence, Executive is not required to file a tax return until Executive has obtained the maximum number and length of filing extensions available, and Executive shall have provided a copy of the relevant portions of such tax return to the Company not less than 10 days prior to filing such tax return.
4.4.2.
     
If any tax authority finally determines that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed upon the Original Payments or the Gross-Up Amount than is determined by the Company's independent auditors or reflected in Executive's tax returns, Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional Gross-Up Amount calculated on the basis of the additional amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable by such tax authority (including related penalties and interest) from the Company within 30 days after such determination. Executive shall cooperate with the Company as it may reasonably request to permit the Company (at its sole expense) to contest the determination of such taxing authority to minimize the amount payable under this Section 4.4. If any tax authority finally determines the Excise Tax payable by Executive to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Amount, Executive shall repay the Company, within 30 days after Executive's receipt of a tax refund resulting from that determination, to the extent of such refund, the portion of the Gross-Up Amount attributable to such reduction (including the refunded portion of Gross-Up Amount attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Amount being repaid, less any additional income tax resulting from receipt of such refund).
4.5.1.
     
Payments to Executive under this Article 4 shall be bifurcated into two portions, consisting of a portion that does not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and a portion that does constitute nonqualified
 
13
 
deferred compensation. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion, if any, that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. However, if Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the date that is six months and one day after Executive's Date of Termination (the "Earliest Payment Date"). Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to Executive hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year of Executive following the taxable year of Executive in which the Date of Termination occurs.
4.5.2.
     
The parties acknowledge and agree that the interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and its application to the terms of this Agreement is uncertain and may be subject to change as additional guidance and interpretations become available. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits or payments provided by the Company to Executive that would be deemed to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If, however, any such benefit or payment is deemed to not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive agree to renegotiate in good faith any such benefit or payment (including, without limitation, as to the timing of any severance payments payable hereof) so that either (i) Section 409A of the Code will not apply or (ii) compliance with Section 409A of the Code will be achieved; provided, however, that any deferral of payments or other benefits shall be only for such time period as may be required to comply with Section 409A; and
provided
,
further
, that payments or other benefits that occur as a result of the application of this section shall themselves comply with Section 409A of the Code.
4.6.
        
General Release
. In order to be eligible to receive any of the salary or benefits under Article 4 hereof, Executive (or his personal representative, if applicable) shall be required to execute and deliver to the Company (without subsequent revocation) a general release of claims against the Company, excluding any claims concerning the Company's obligations under this Agreement in a form provided by and reasonably satisfactory to the Company which shall contain a release of claims by Executive substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A
, and shall be required to sign such other agreements as executive employees of the Company are generally required to sign if Executive shall not have already done so. The Company shall have no other liability or obligation under this Agreement to Executive's executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns or any other person claiming under or through Executive.
Article 5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
5.1.
        
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
. Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees that while
 
14
 
Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of the longer of (a) one year after the Date of Termination, in the case of a termination other than within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company, (b) 18 months after the Date of Termination in the case of a termination within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company:
5.1.1.
     
Executive will not perform services for or own an interest in (except for investments of not more than five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares or other equity interests of a company or entity in which Executive does not actively participate in management) any firm, person or other entity that competes in any geographic area with the Company in the business of the development, manufacture, promotion, distribution or sale of professional or consumer film, video or audio production tools, including, but not limited to, editing, special effects, 3D, animation, live sound, broadcast or newsroom products or systems, content-creation tools, media storage or other business or services in which the Company is engaged or plans (as evidenced by consideration by the Company's executive staff or by the Board) to engage at the time Executive's employment with the Company terminates.
5.1.2.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly assist others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is prohibited to engage by Section 5.1.1.
5.1.3.
     
Executive will not directly or indirectly either alone or in association with others (a) solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company, or (b) solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any natural person who was employed by the Company at any time; provided that this section (i) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual whose employment with the Company has been terminated for a period of one year or longer or whose engagement to the Company as an independent contractor has been terminated for a period of six months or longer and (ii) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual arising from such individual's affirmative response to a general recruitment effort carried out through a public solicitation or a general solicitation.

5.2.
        
Reasonableness of Restrictions
. It is expressly understood and agreed that (a) although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Article 5 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Article 5 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (b) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
15
 
5.3.
        
Remedies for Breach
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 5 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive expressly agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions or any other equitable remedy which may then be available. In addition, in the event of a breach of Article 5 which is not remedied after 10 days' written notice from the Company (if such breach is susceptible to cure), whether or not Executive is employed by the Company, the Company shall cease to have any obligations to make payments to Executive under this Agreement (except for payments, if any, earned prior to such breach).
Article 6. Miscellaneous
6.1.
        
Indemnification
. Executive shall be entitled to indemnification as set forth in Article Eleventh of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which has been provided to Executive. Following termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Company shall continue to indemnify Executive against all claims related to actions arising prior to the termination of Executive's employment to the fullest extent permitted by law. A directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (or policies) shall be kept in place, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter until at least the fourth anniversary of the date the Agreement is terminated for any reason, providing coverage to Executive that is no less favorable to him in any respect (including, without limitation, with respect to scope, exclusions, amounts and deductibles) than the coverage then being provided to any other present or former officer or director of the Company.
6.2.
        
Counsel Fees
. The Company shall pay to the Executive reimbursement for all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination of the Executive's employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in connection with review of determinations made under Section 4.4, and any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the potential application of Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code to any payment or benefit provided by the Company to Executive. Such reimbursement payments shall be made within 15 days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.
6.3.
        
No Mitigation
. The Company agrees that, except as specifically set forth in Section 4.3.3(d) and Section 4.3.4(b) regarding COBRA premium reimbursement, (i) if Executive's employment is terminated during the term of this agreement, Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Executive by the Company and (ii) the amount of any payment provided hereunder shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive.

Exhibit 10.1
 
Avid Technology, Inc.
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement
 
This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January 28, 2008 (the "Grant Date"), by and between Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), with its principal executive offices at Avid Technology Park, One Park West, Tewksbury, MA 01876, and Kenneth A. Sexton (the "Recipient"), an individual residing at 520 Bristol Dr., Aurora, OH 44202.
As used herein, except as otherwise indicated, the term "Recipient" shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the rights to the RSUs (as defined below) validly under the terms of this Agreement and the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code").
1.
            
Grant of Restricted Stock Units
. The Company hereby grants to the Recipient on the Grant Date fifty thousand (50,000) restricted stock units of the Company ("RSUs"). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
2.
            
Vesting Schedule; Forfeiture
. The RSUs shall vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, ending on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date (each such vesting date being referred to as a "Vesting Date"). In the event that the Recipient ceases to work for the Company (as an employee, officer or director thereof, or an advisor or consultant thereto), for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, prior to the final Vesting Date, vesting shall cease and the Recipient will forfeit all rights with respect to any RSUs that have not then vested. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2 or in Section 6, if the Recipient's employment with the Company is terminated, then the RSUs shall be subject to any applicable, superseding vesting terms as set forth in the Executive Employment Agreement, dated January 21, 2008, between the Recipient and the Company, or any successor agreement thereto (the "Employment Agreement"), to the extent such Employment Agreement is then effective.
3.
            
Distribution of Shares
. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares pursuant to this Agreement until (i) all conditions of the Agreement have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities and tax laws and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Recipient has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
 
- 1 -
 
 
 
(a)
          
No shares will be issued pursuant to the vesting of any RSUs unless and until the Recipient satisfies any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be paid in respect of the RSUs. Subject to such conditions as the Company may establish, such tax obligations shall be paid in whole in cash promptly following each Vesting Date. The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient.
(b)
          
The Recipient acknowledges that no election under Section 83(b) of the Code may be filed with respect to this award.
5.
            
Nontransferability of RSUs
. The RSUs may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Recipient, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
(a)
          
Changes in Capitalization
. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization, or any dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, the number and class of securities subject to each outstanding RSU shall be equitably adjusted by the Company as determined by the Board.
(b)
          
Reorganization Events
. A "Reorganization Event" shall mean: (i) any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity as a result of which all of the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or is cancelled, (ii) any exchange of all of the Common Stock for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a share exchange transaction, or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company. In connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to the RSUs (or any portion thereof) on such terms as the Board determines: (A) provide that the RSUs shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent RSUs shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (B) provide that the RSUs shall become realizable or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to the RSUs shall lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon such Reorganization Event, (C) in the event of a Reorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the "Acquisition Price"), make or provide for a cash payment to the Recipient equal to the Acquisition Price times the number of shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs (if applicable, net of any applicable tax withholdings), (D) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the RSUs shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of any applicable tax withholdings), and (E) any combination of the foregoing.
For purposes of clause (A) above, the RSUs shall be considered assumed if, following consummation of the Reorganization Event, the RSUs confer the right to receive, for each share issuable pursuant to the RSUs immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event, the consideration (whether cash, securities or other property) received as a result of the Reorganization Event by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the
 
- 2 -
 
 
 
outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if the consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received with respect to the RSUs to consist solely of common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) equivalent in value (as determined by the Board) to the per share consideration received by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization Event.
(a)
          
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision.
(b)
          
Severability
. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and each such other provision shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
(c)
          
Binding Effect
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Recipient and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 5.
(d)
          
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, together with the Employment Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof.
(e)
          
Compliance with Code Section 409A
. This Agreement does not, and shall not be amended so as to, provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board, at the time of amendment, specifically provides that this Agreement is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f)
           
Amendment
. Except with respect to any right-to-exercise and vesting terms set forth in the Employment Agreement, the Board may amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, including but not limited to, substituting another award of the same or a different type and changing the date of vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient's consent to such action shall be required unless (i) the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Recipient's rights under this Agreement, or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein, the Board may, in its discretion, remove or modify any part or all of the restrictions applicable to the RSUs, provided that the Board may only exercise such rights in extraordinary circumstances, which shall include, without limitation, death or disability of the Recipient; estate planning needs of the Recipient; or any other nonrecurring significant event affecting the Company or the Recipient.
(g)
          
Acceleration
. The Board may at any time provide that the RSUs shall become immediately vested in full or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions.
 
- 3 -
 
 
 
(h)
          
Administration by Board
. The Board will administer this Agreement and may construe and interpret the terms hereof. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Employment Agreement, the Board may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Agreement into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. No director or person acting pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board shall be liable for any action or determination relating to or under this Agreement made in good faith.
(i)
           
Appointment of Committees
. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers hereunder to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (a "Committee"). All references herein to the "Board" shall mean the Board or a Committee to the extent that the Board's powers or authority hereunder have been delegated to such Committee.
(j)
           
No Right to Employment or Other Status
. The grant of the RSUs shall not be construed as giving the Recipient the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with the Recipient free from any liability or claim hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or provided in the Employment Agreement.
(k)
          
No Rights as Stockholder
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Recipient shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares to be distributed with respect to the RSUs until becoming the record holder of such shares.
(l)
           
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one in the same instrument.
(m)
         
Unfunded Rights
. The right of the Recipient to receive Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. The Recipient shall have no rights under these terms and conditions other than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.

It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). As used herein, except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee" shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under the terms of this Agreement and the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code.
1.
            
Grant of Option
. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee on the Grant Date an option to purchase two hundred sixty thousand (260,000) shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") at an exercise price of $26.15 per share (the "Exercise Price") and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
2.
            
Vesting Schedule
. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the seventh (7) anniversary of the Grant Date (the "Final Exercise Date"), subject to the vesting schedule set forth below. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible, it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Sections 3 or 9.
th
(a)
          
Fifty thousand (50,000) shares subject to this option shall vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, ending on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date, as long as Executive is employed by the Company on each such vesting date;
(b)
          
Fifty thousand (50,000) shares subject to this option shall vest at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following the Grant Date during which the Common Stock, as quoted on Nasdaq (or on such other exchange as such shares may be traded), trades (without regard to the closing price) at a price per share of at least $50.84, as adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends; and
(c)
          
Fifty thousand (50,000) shares subject to this option shall vest at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following the Grant Date during which the Common Stock, as quoted on Nasdaq (or on such other exchange as such shares may be traded), trades (without regard to the closing price) at a price per share of at least $76.26, as adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends.
 
- 1 -
 
 
(d)
          
One hundred ten thousand (110,000) shares subject to this option (the "ROE Option Shares") shall vest in accordance with the following table, based upon improvement in the Company's Return on Equity, or ROE (as defined below), in calendar year periods, commencing with calendar year 2008. Improvements for each calendar year shall be measured against a baseline ROE for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2007 ("Baseline").
 
 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") shall make the final determination of ROE and the ROE percentage point improvement for purposes hereof for each calendar year no later then the 1st day of March following the end of such calendar year. The determination of ROE shall be based upon the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable calendar year and the unaudited financial statements for the Baseline period. The ROE Option Shares, if any, that are not vested at the end of the seventh calendar year (2014) shall be forfeited.
"Return on Equity" or "ROE" shall be determined using the Company's published non-GAAP net income, adding the provision for income taxes and subtracting the non-GAAP related tax adjustments for the applicable period and dividing by the average common stockholder equity during the same period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROE Option Shares shall vest in full at the end of the first 20 consecutive trading day period following the Grant Date during which the Common Stock, as quoted on Nasdaq (or on such other exchange as such shares may be traded), trades (without regard to the closing price) at a price per share of at least $101.68, as adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends.
(a)
          
Form of Exercise
. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time, and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4 for the number of shares for which the option is exercised. The Company shall provide the Optionee with instructions as to how this option may be exercised. Any change to such instructions shall be communicated to the Optionee in writing before such change takes effect. The Optionee may purchase fewer than the number of shares covered
 
 
- 2 -
 
hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share or for fewer than ten (10) whole shares.
(b)
          
Continuous Relationship with the Company Required
. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company (an "Eligible Optionee").
(c)
          
Termination of Relationship with the Company
. If the Optionee ceases to be an Eligible Optionee for any reason, then, except as provided in Sections 3(d)-(g) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate
three (3) months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation.
(d)
          
Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability
. If the Optionee dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for Cause (as defined in the Executive Employment Agreement, dated January 21, 2008, between the Optionee and the Company, or any successor agreement thereto (the "Employment Agreement")), this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one (1) year following the date of death or disability of the Optionee, by the Optionee (or, in the case of death, by an authorized transferee), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his death or disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.
(e)
          
Discharge for Cause
. If the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for Cause, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge.
(f)
           
Effect of Breach of Covenants
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 3(c) and (d), if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon
such violation.
(g)
          
Employment Agreement
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3 or in Section 9, this option shall be subject to any applicable, superseding right-to-exercise and vesting terms set forth in the Employment Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to exercise this option extend beyond the Final Exercise Date.
4.
            
Payment of Purchase Price
. Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of this option shall be paid for as follows:
(b)
          
with the prior consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, by (i) delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to sell the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise and to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the Exercise Price for the shares of Common Stock to which the
 
 
- 3 -
 
exercise relates and any required tax withholding, or (ii) delivery by the Optionee to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay such Exercise Price and any required tax withholding;
(c)
          
if the Common Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee valued at their fair market value ("Fair Market Value"), as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board, provided (i) such method of payment is then permitted under applicable law, (ii) such Common Stock, if acquired directly from the Company, was owned by the Optionee for six (6) months or such other minimum period of time, if any, as may be established by the Board in its discretion, and (iii) such Common Stock is not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements;
(d)
          
to the extent permitted by applicable law and by the Board, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine; or
5.
            
Distribution of Shares
. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares pursuant to this Agreement until (i) all conditions of the Agreement have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Optionee has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
6.
            
Tax Matters
. No shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of this option unless and until the Optionee pays to the Company, or makes provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of this option. In the Board's discretion, and subject to such conditions as the Board may establish, such tax obligations may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the option creating the tax obligation, valued at their fair market value, as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board. The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee.
7.
            
Nontransferability of Option
. This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the lifetime of the Optionee, this option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee.
8.
            
Limitation on Repricing
. Unless such action is approved by the Company's stockholders: (a) this option may not be amended to provide an exercise price per share that is lower than the then-current exercise price per share (other than adjustments pursuant to Section 9), (b) the Board may not cancel this option and grant in substitution therefor a new option covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock and having an exercise price per share
 
 
- 4 -
 
lower than the then-current exercise price per share of the cancelled option, and (c) the Board may not exchange this option for a cash payment.
(a)
          
Changes in Capitalization
. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, the number and class of securities and Exercise Price per share of this option shall be equitably adjusted by the Company in the manner determined by the Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the Exercise Price of and the number of shares subject to this option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such dividend), then the Optionee, if he exercises the option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend, shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon the option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such stock dividend.
(b)
          
Reorganization Events
. A "Reorganization Event" shall mean: (i) any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity as a result of which all of the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or is cancelled, (ii) any exchange of all of the Common Stock for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a share exchange transaction, or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company. In connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to this option (or any portion thereof) on such terms as the Board determines: (A) provide that this option shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent options shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (B) upon written notice to the Optionee, provide that the unexercised portion of this option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such Reorganization Event unless exercised by the Optionee within a specified period following the date of such notice, (C) provide that this option shall become exercisable, realizable or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to this option shall lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon such Reorganization Event, (D) in the event of a Reorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the "Acquisition Price"), make or provide for a cash payment to the Optionee equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Acquisition Price times the number of shares subject to this option (to the extent the Exercise Price does not exceed the Acquisition Price) over (y) the Exercise Price times the number of shares subject to this option in exchange for the termination of the option and any applicable tax withholdings, (E) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, this option shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of the Exercise Price and any applicable tax withholdings), and (F) any combination of the foregoing.
For purposes of clause (A) above, this option shall be considered assumed if, following consummation of the Reorganization Event, this option confers the right to purchase, for each share subject to this option immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event, the consideration (whether cash, securities or other property) received as a result of the
 
 
- 5 -
 
Reorganization Event by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if the consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of this option to consist solely of common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) equivalent in value (as determined by the Board) to the per share consideration received by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization Event.
(a)
          
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision.
(b)
          
Severability
. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and each such other provision shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
(c)
          
Binding Effect
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Optionee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 7.
(d)
          
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, together with the Employment Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof.
(e)
          
Compliance with Code Section 409A
. This Agreement does not, and shall not be amended so as to, provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board, at the time of amendment, specifically provides that this Agreement is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f)
           
Amendment
. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8, and except with respect to any right-to-exercise and vesting terms set forth in the Employment Agreement, the Board may amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, including but not limited to, substituting another option of the same or a different type and changing the date of exercise or realization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionee's consent to such action shall be required unless (i) the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Optionee, or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 9 and the Employment Agreement.
(g)
          
Acceleration

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Avid Reports Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
 
Tewksbury, MA
 January 31, 2008  Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) today reported revenue of $258.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2007, compared to $239.0 million for the same period in 2006. GAAP net income for the quarter was $3.9 million, or $.09 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $52.6 million, or $1.28 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes $13.3 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, other costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.42. For the fourth quarter of 2006, GAAP net income included $75.1 million of impairment charges, amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.54 in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
During the fourth quarter, the company's cash balance increased by $27.2 million to $224.5 million at December 31, 2007 primarily due to operating cash flow.
 
"Though sales and cash flow were strong, we are disappointed with the lower than expected earnings performance and need to improve our profitability" said Gary Greenfield, Avid's chairman and chief executive officer. "As we continue with the transformation of Avid into a more efficient and customer-focused organization, we are taking a long-term view that we believe will ultimately return the most value to our shareholders."
 
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $929.6 million, compared to revenue of $910.6 million in 2006. GAAP net loss for 2007 was $8.0 million, or $.19 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $42.9 million, or $1.03 per share, for 2006. GAAP net loss for 2007
 
includes $59.1 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, other costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.23 per diluted share for 2007. GAAP net loss for 2006 includes $113.9 million of impairment charges, amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, in-process research and development and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.67 for 2006.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage our business, for example, in establishing our annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under our employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by our management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, we believe it is useful for our investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with our past financial results. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Our management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The above release is subject to the completion and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as Avid's ability to meet customer needs, market acceptance of Avid's existing and new products, Avid's ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner, competitive factors, pricing pressures, delays in product shipments and other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

(e)
On March 18, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) approved the terms of the Companys 2008 Executive Bonus Plan (the Bonus Plan). The Compensation Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Bonus Plan. All of the Companys executive officers, with limited exceptions, are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan. Each participant must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2008 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under the Bonus Plan.
Under the Bonus Plan, each participant is assigned a target bonus amount that is equal to a percentage of the actual base salary paid to him or her in 2008. These percentages are set forth in each participants employment agreement with the Company and vary among participants within the range of 40%-100%.
The bonus payout for each participant will be based on the financial performance of the Company, the financial performance of each participants business unit and the participants personal performance relative to a set of defined goals specific to that participant. The preceding components have been assigned weights for purposes of calculating bonus payouts, as set forth below:
 
The financial performance of the Company and the business units will be evaluated in terms of revenue and operating profit. Key areas for the personal performance objectives include, among other things, improved financial metrics, product deliveries and improved customer satisfaction objectives.
The Companys performance and each business units performance relative to their respective revenue and operating profit objectives and each participants performance relative to each of his or her personal goals will be scored based on criteria that have been established by the Compensation Committee. Scores may range from 0.00 to 1.35, with a score of 1.00 representing a target performance level. These scores will be used in a weighted average formula to calculate each participants overall bonus score, which will be multiplied by each participants target bonus amount to determine his or her actual bonus payout for 2008. Each participant may earn up to 135% of his or her target bonus amount under the Bonus Plan. Bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2009 after the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but in no event later than December 31, 2009.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company fails to achieve at least 50% of its target operating profit under the Bonus Plan, all bonus payouts will be reduced to zero. Also, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, approve additional bonuses to participants based on performance or provide participants additional incentives.
The preceding description of the Bonus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bonus Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

2008 EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN
On March 18, 2008 (the 
Effective Date
), the Compensation Committee (the 
Compensation Committee
) of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the 
Company
) adopted this 2008 Executive Bonus Plan (the 
Plan
).
The purpose of this Plan is: (i) to advance the interests of the Companys stockholders by enhancing the Companys ability to attract, retain and motivate its executive officers, and (ii) to reward its executive officers for their contributions toward the achievement of certain Company and business unit financial goals and their personal performance during 2008. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Company, as used in this Plan, includes any of the Companys present or future parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.
The Compensation Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan, except as otherwise set forth herein. The Compensation Committee may interpret and construe the Plan, decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan, and correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent it deems expedient to carry the Plan into effect. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may amend, suspend, revoke or terminate the Plan at any time. All bonus payouts under the Plan are subject to prior approval by the Compensation Committee. All decisions by the Compensation Committee will be made in the Compensation Committees sole discretion and will be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan.
All of the Companys executive officers will be eligible to participate in the Plan, excluding executive officers hired after September 30, 2008. Eligible executive officers must be employed by the Company on December 31, 2008 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under this Plan. An eligible executive officer who ceases to be employed by the Company, other than as a result of termination by the Company for cause, after December 31, 2008, but prior to the bonus payout date, will be entitled to receive a bonus pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan (in the event of termination by the Company for cause, the executive officer will not be entitled to any bonus under this Plan). For purposes of the Plan, the following individuals will be deemed to be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2008: (i) any executive officer on an approved leave of absence on that date, and (ii) any executive officer who in 2008 becomes disabled and qualifies for benefits under the Companys long-term disability plan. For individuals who become executive officers of the Company during 2008 as a result of an acquisition, initial eligibility for participation in the Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee on a case-by-case basis. Each eligible executive officer is deemed a 
Participant
 in the Plan.
Each Participant has been designated by the Company as being eligible to earn a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of the Participants base salary (the 
Bonus Percentage
).
Page 1
 
Each Participants 
Target Bonus Amount
 for 2008 is his or her Bonus Percentage multiplied by the actual base salary paid to the Participant in 2008. For purposes of the Plan, actual base salary includes regular wages and vacation, sick time and holiday pay, but not leave of absence, bonus or other premium pay.
Actual bonus payouts will be based on the following three components: Company Performance, Business Unit Performance and Personal Performance (each referred to as a 
Performance Component
). Each Performance Component is described in greater detail in Section 6. The Performance Components have been assigned weights for purposes of calculating bonus payouts, in accordance with the following table:
 
The relative weightings of Company Performance and Business Unit Performance will be determined by the Compensation Committee and may vary among Participants.
 
For each Company Metric, the Compensation Committee will establish a minimum performance level, a target performance level and a maximum performance level. Each Company Metric will receive a score based upon achievement of these performance levels as set forth in the following table:
 
The scores attached to each Company Metric will be used in the following formula, which incorporates the weight of each Company Metric, to determine the 
Company Performance Score
:
 
 
Page 2
 
 
For each Business Unit Metric, the Compensation Committee will establish a minimum performance level, a target performance level and a maximum performance level. Each Business Unit Metric will receive a score based upon achievement of these performance levels as set forth in the following table:
 
The scores attached to each Business Unit Metric will be used in the following formula, which incorporates the weight of each Business Unit Metric, to determine the 
Business Unit Performance Score
:
 
The Participants performance relative to each goal will be scored on a scale of 0.00 to 1.35, with a score of 1.00 representing target performance.
Within a reasonable period of time after December 31, 2008, each Participant will receive from the Compensation Committee, a final written, scored assessment of his or her performance relative to each goal. The scores attached to the goals will be used in the following formula, which incorporates the weight of each goal, to determine each Participants 
Personal Performance Score
:
 
Page 3
 
 
Each Participant will be assigned an 
Overall Participant Score
 that will be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth below:
 
Each Participants actual bonus payout under this Plan, if any, will be determined in accordance with the following formula:
 
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company fails to achieve at least 50% of the target Company operating profit established by the Compensation Committee pursuant to Section 6.1, the bonus payout will be reduced to zero for each Participant. In addition, at the Compensation Committees discretion, it may approve additional bonuses to Participants (based on performance) or provide Participants additional incentives.
Bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2009 after the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission for fiscal year 2008, although the Company will not have any liability to any Participant if bonus payouts are delayed beyond that time period for any reason, provided that in no event will the bonuses, if any, be paid later than December 31, 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Avid Reports First Quarter 2008 Results
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass.
 April 24, 2008  Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today reported revenue of $198.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008, compared to $218.9 million for the same period in 2007. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $21.1 million, or $.54 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $20,000, or $.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007.
 
GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2008 includes $9.4 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP loss per share was $.30. For the first quarter of 2007, GAAP net income included $10.6 million of charges, including amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.25 in the first quarter of 2007.
 
At March 31, 2008, the companys cash balance totaled $150.4 million, down $74.0 million since the end of 2007.  During the first quarter of 2008, the company used $93.2 million in cash to re-purchase 4.3 million shares of common stock under the previously-announced share buyback program.
 
Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we expect to see improvement in our bottom line as the year progresses, said Gary Greenfield, Avids chairman and chief executive officer. We are continuing to make progress on a number of initiatives designed to provide the basis for improved profitability and growth.  In addition, the development of Avids long-term strategy is proceeding well and we expect to discuss the plan during our second quarter results conference call.
 
Recent Highlights
Recent highlights include:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the companys ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the companys current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the companys use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the companys operations. The companys management compensates for these limitations by considering the companys financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.
 
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avids first quarter 2008 financial results will be held today, April 24, 2008, at 5:00 p.m. EDT. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing (719) 457-2617 and referencing confirmation code 3538405. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avids website. To listen via this alternative, go to the Investor Relations page under the About Us menu at
www.avid.com
for complete details prior to the start of the conference call.
 
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The above release is subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation
 
Reform Act of 1995, about Avids performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as Avids ability to meet customer needs, market acceptance of Avids existing and new products, Avids ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner, competitive factors, pricing pressures, delays in product shipments and other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avids filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avids estimate only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the companys estimate as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed in the Notice.
It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee," as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code.
2.           
Vesting Schedule
. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the seventh anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the Grant Date, subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 or the Plan.
(a)       
Form of Exercise
. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of Shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional Share or for fewer than ten whole Shares.
(b)       
Continuous Relationship with the Company Required
. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company (an "Eligible Optionee").
(c)       
Termination of Relationship with the Company
. If the Optionee ceases to be an Eligible Optionee for any reason, then, except as provided in Sections 3(d) and (e), the right to exercise this option shall terminate
three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date),
provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these terms and conditions, the Notice or the Plan, if the Optionee's employment with the Company is terminated, then this option shall be subject to any applicable,

superseding vesting and exercise terms as set forth in the Optionee's then-effective employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company, if any.
(d)       
Exercise Period Upon Death, Disability or Retirement
. If the Optionee dies, becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) or retires prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "Cause" as defined in Section 3(e), this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of death, disability or retirement of the Optionee, by the Optionee (or, in the case of death, by an authorized transferee),
provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his or her death, disability or retirement, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.
For purposes of this Section 3, "retirement" shall mean the cessation of employment with the Company for any reason other than "Cause" as defined in Section 3(e), by an Optionee who is at least 60 years of age and who has been employed continuously by the Company for the seven years immediately preceding the date of cessation of employment.
(e)       
Discharge for Cause
. If the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. "Cause" shall mean willful misconduct by the Optionee or willful failure by the Optionee to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Optionee of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee is party to an employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company that contains a definition of "cause" for termination of employment, "Cause" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such agreement. The Optionee shall be considered to have been discharged for "Cause" if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Optionee's resignation, that discharge for Cause was warranted.
(f)        
Effect of Breach of Covenants
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 3(c) and (d), if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, breaches (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions of any employment or nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon

(d)       to the extent permitted by applicable law and by the Board, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine; or
(e)        by any combination of the above permitted forms of payment.
5.            .
Tax Matters

In the Board's discretion, and subject to such conditions as the Board may establish, such tax obligations may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including Shares retained from the option creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value. The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee.
Withholding
(b)       
Disqualifying Disposition
. If the Optionee disposes of Shares acquired upon exercise of this option within two years from the Grant Date or one year after such Shares were acquired pursuant to exercise of this option, the Optionee shall notify the Company's Stock Plan Manager by post or inter-office mail at Avid Technology, Inc., Building One, Mail Stop #5, One Park West, Tewksbury, MA 01876 of such disposition.
(c)       
Termination of Employment
. If the Optionee's employment with the Company is terminated but such Optionee remains an Eligible Optionee, such Eligible Optionee must exercise this option (to the extent it is exercisable on the date of such termination) within three months following the Eligible Optionee's termination in order for the option to receive incentive stock option treatment under Section 422 of the Code. After such three-month period, the option, to the extent exercisable, will convert to a nonstatutory stock option.
 
6.            
Nontransferability of Option
. This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of the Optionee, this option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee.

Purchase of Shares
. The Company shall issue and sell to the Participant, and the Participant shall purchase from the Company, subject to theses terms and conditions, the attached Notice and the Plan, the number of Shares identified in the Notice at a purchase price per Share identified in the Notice. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall be paid by the Participant by check payable to the order of the Company or such other method as may be acceptable to the Company. The Company shall record on its books the issuance to the Participant of that number of Shares purchased by the Participant. The Participant agrees that the Shares shall be subject to the Purchase Option set forth in Section 2 and the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed in the Notice.
(a)      The Shares shall vest as set forth in the Notice. Except as provided in Sections 2(b) and (c), in the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company (as an employee or officer of, or an advisor or consultant to, the Company) for any reason or no reason, with or without Cause (as defined in Section 2(c)), prior to the final vesting date of the Shares, vesting shall cease and the Company shall have the right and option (the "Purchase Option") to purchase from the Participant, for a price per Share specified in the Notice (the "Option Price"), some or all of the Shares that are not then vested. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these terms and conditions, the Notice or the Plan, if the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated, then this restricted stock award shall be subject to any applicable, superseding vesting terms as set forth in the Participant's then-effective employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company, if any.
(b)     In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of death or disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) prior to the final vesting date of the Shares, the Participant's Shares that vest solely based on the passage of time ("Time-Based Shares") shall vest with respect to an additional number of Time-Based Shares that would have vested during the one-year period following the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company.

For purposes of this Section 2(c), "retirement" shall mean the cessation of employment with the Company for any reason other than "Cause" by a Participant who is at least 60 years of age and who has been employed continuously by the Company for the seven years immediately preceding the date of cessation of employment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is party to an employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company that contains a definition of "cause" for termination of employment, "Cause" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such agreement. The Participant shall be considered to have been discharged for "Cause" if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Participant's resignation, that discharge for Cause was warranted.

Such notice shall specify the number of Shares to be purchased. If and to the extent the Purchase Option is not so exercised by the giving of such a notice within such 90-day period, the Purchase Option shall automatically expire and terminate effective upon the expiration of such 90-day period.
(b)     Within 10 days after delivery to the Participant of the Company's notice of the exercise of the Purchase Option pursuant to Section 3(a), the Company shall cause to be transferred to the Company on its books that number of Shares that the Company has elected to purchase in accordance with the terms herein. In the event a certificate or certificates representing the Shares have been issued to the Participant, the Participant shall tender to the Company at its principal offices the certificate or certificates representing the Shares that the Company has elected to purchase in accordance with the terms herein, duly endorsed in blank or with duly endorsed stock powers attached thereto, all in form suitable for the transfer of such Shares to the Company. Upon such transfer, the Company shall deliver or mail to the Participant a check in the amount of the aggregate Option Price for such Shares (provided that any delay in making such payment shall not invalidate the Company's exercise of the Purchase Option with respect to such Shares).
(c)      After the time at which any Shares are transferred to the Company pursuant to Section 3(b), the Company shall not pay any dividend to the Participant on account of such Shares or permit the Participant to exercise any of the privileges or rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, but shall, in so far as permitted by law, treat the Company as the owner of such Shares.

(d)     The Option Price may be payable, at the option of the Company, in cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Participant to the Company or in cash (by check) or both.

(a)      The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively, "transfer") any unvested Shares, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order,
provided
that such Shares shall remain subject to these terms and conditions (including without limitation the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 4, and the Purchase Option) and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions herein.
(b)      The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Shares which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein, or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to pay dividends to any transferee to whom any such Shares shall have been so sold or transferred.

"These shares of stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and an option to purchase set forth in that certain Restricted Stock Award Terms and Conditions, and a copy of such Restricted Stock Award Terms and Conditions is available for inspection without charge at the office of the Secretary of the corporation."
(a)      The Participant acknowledges and agrees that to satisfy any federal, state or local withholding tax obligation required by law to be withheld or paid in respect of this award, the Company shall deduct and retain from the Shares no longer subject to the Purchase Option under Section 2 such number of Shares as is equal in value to the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the lapse of the Purchase Option (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and

state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such income), based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the vesting date of the Shares. The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he or she is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Company's common stock. The Participant and the Company have structured these terms and conditions to constitute a "binding contract" relating to the sale of the Company's common stock pursuant to this Section 6, consistent with the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act.
(b)       The Participant acknowledges that he or she is responsible for obtaining the advice of the Participant's own tax advisors with respect to the acquisition of the Shares and the Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents with respect to the tax consequences relating to the Shares. The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's tax liability that may arise in connection with the acquisition, vesting and/or disposition of the Shares.
The Participant acknowledges that he or she has been informed of the availability of making an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, with respect to the issuance of the Shares and that the Participant had decided not to file a Section 83(b) election.

AVID
TECHNOLOGY,
INC.
 
 
 
 
 
Avid Technology, Inc.
Stock Option Grant under HMRC Approved Sub-Plan for UK Employees
Terms and Conditions
 
1.       
Grant of Option
. The Company has adopted the Plan and has granted to the Optionee an option pursuant to the UK Sub-Plan to purchase the number of Shares identified in the Notice at the price per share and subject to these terms and conditions, the Notice and the UK Sub-Plan. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed in the Notice.
It is intended that the option evidenced hereby shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Optionee," as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code.
2.       
Vesting Schedule
. Except as otherwise provided herein, this option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to the seventh anniversary (the "Final Exercise Date") of the Grant Date, subject to the vesting schedule provided in the Notice. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 or the UK Sub-Plan.
3.       
Exercise of Option
.
(a)       
Form of Exercise
. Each election to exercise this option shall be in a manner as determined by the Company from time to time and shall be accompanied by payment in full in accordance with Section 4. The Optionee may purchase less than the number of Shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional Share or for fewer than ten whole Shares.
(b)       
Continuous Relationship with the Company Required
. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Optionee, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee of the Company (an "Eligible Employee").
(c)       
Termination of Relationship with the Company
. If the Optionee ceases to be an Eligible Employee for any reason, then, except as provided in Sections 3(d) and (e), the right to exercise this option shall terminate
and the option shall lapse three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date),
provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these terms and conditions, the Notice or the UK
 
 
 
 
Sub-Plan, if the Optionee's employment with the Company is terminated, then this option shall be subject to any applicable, superseding vesting and exercise terms as set forth in the Optionee's then-effective employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company, if any.
(d)      
Exercise Period Upon Retirement, Death or Disability
. If the Optionee retires, dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Optionee and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "Cause" as defined in Section 3(e), this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of retirement, death or disability of the Optionee (on the expiry of which period the option shall lapse), by the Optionee (o, in the case of death, by his or her personal representatives),
provided
that
this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Optionee on the date of his or her retirement, death or disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date. For purposes of this Section 3, "retirement" shall mean the cessation of employment with the Company for any reason other than "Cause" as defined in Section 3(e), by an Optionee who is at least 60 years of age and who has been employed continuously by the Company for the seven years immediately preceding the date of cessation of employment.
(e)       
Discharge for Cause
. If the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate and the option will lapse immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. "Cause" shall mean willful misconduct by the Optionee or willful failure by the Optionee to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Optionee of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee is party to an employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement with the Company that contains a definition of "cause" for termination of employment, "Cause" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such agreement. The Optionee shall be considered to have been discharged for "Cause" if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Optionee's resignation, that discharge for Cause was warranted.
(f)        
Effect of Breach of Covenants
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 3(c) and (d), if the Optionee, prior to the Final Exercise Date, breaches (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions of any employment or nondisclosure agreement or other similar agreement between the Optionee and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon
such breach.
 
4.         
Payment of Purchase Price
. Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of this option shall be paid for in cash or by cheque or banker's draft, payable to the order of the Company or may be paid out of funds provided on loan by a bank, broker or other person.
5.         
Adjustment Provisions for Recapitalizations and Related Transactions
. In the event of (a) any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination of shares or other similar change in capitalization, (b) the outstanding shares of Common Stock are increased, decreased or
 
 
 
 
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company, or (c) additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities, the Board of Directors of the Company may, with the prior approval of the HMRC, make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment in the number of Shares and price of the Shares subject to this option, without changing the aggregate purchase price as to which this option remains exercisable.
6.          
Change of Control
. Rule 26 of the UK Sub-Plan sets out the circumstances upon a change of control under which options may be substituted for new options in the acquiring company and retain their tax approved status. If the provisions of this Rule are not met, the Board of Directors of the Company, will give written notice to Optionees and any outstanding option will be exercisable in accordance with Section 10(b)(2)(ii) of the Plan.
(a)       The grant of options under the UK Sub-Plan is made at the discretion of the Company and the UK Sub-Plan may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time. The grant of an option in one year or at one time does not in any way entitle the Optionee to an option grant in the future. The UK Sub-Plan is wholly discretionary and is not to be considered part of the Optionee's normal or expected compensation subject to severance, resignation, redundancy or similar compensation. The value of the option is an extraordinary item of compensation which is outside the scope of the Optionee's employment contract (if any).
(b)       Nothing in these terms and conditions or the UK Sub-Plan shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue in service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any company employing or retaining the Optionee) or of the Optionee, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate the Optionee's service.
(c)       The rights and obligations of the Optionee under the terms of the Optionee's office or employment with the Company, any past or present subsidiary, or associated or affiliate company of the Company shall not be affected by the Optionee's participation in the UK Sub-Plan or the grant of this option or any right which the Optionee may have to participate therein, and the Optionee hereby waives all and any rights to compensation or damages in consequence of the termination of the Optionee's office or employment with any such company for any reasons whatsoever (whether lawful or unlawful and including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, in circumstances giving rise to a claim for wrongful dismissal) insofar as those rights arise or may arise from the Optionee's ceasing to have rights under or being entitled to exercise this option as a result of such termination, or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements.
8.          
Data Protection
. The Optionee agrees to the receipt, holding and processing of information in connection with the grant, vesting, exercise, taxation and general administration of the UK Sub-Plan and this option by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company and any of their advisers or agents and to the transmission of such information outside of the European Economic Area for this purpose.
 
 
 
 
9.           
Nontransferability of Option
. This option is personal and no rights granted hereunder may be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) nor shall any such rights be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this option or of such rights contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon this option or such rights, this option and such rights shall, at the election of the Company, become null and void.
10.1       Depending on the circumstances, on exercise of the option the Optionee may have an income tax liability under PAYE and may be required to pay national insurance contributions ("NICs"). If so, then:
(a)       the Company or the company which employs the Optionee may require the Optionee to pay amounts in respect of PAYE and NICs liability in cash;
(b)       the Optionee may be required to:
some or all of the Optionee's employer's secondary class 1 NICs liability arising from exercise of the option; and
(c)       in some circumstances, the Company may withhold the number of Shares required to meet the liabilities in respect of PAYE, primary (employee) class 1 NICs and secondary (employer) class 1 NICs.
(a)       confirms (in writing) that the Optionee agrees to the requirements of the UK Sub-Plan relating to PAYE and NICs (Rule 22). This may be done at the time of exercise; and
(b)       makes any arrangements, or enter into any agreements, that may be required under Rule 22.
11.          
Provisions of the Plan and Schedule 4
. This option is subject to the provisions of the UK Sub-Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Optionee with this option, and Schedule 4 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.
 
 
 
 
(a)       
Governing Law
. These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision.
(b)       
Severability
. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and each such other provision shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
(c)       
Binding Effect
. These terms and conditions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Optionee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns.
(d)       
Entire Agreement
. These terms and conditions, the attached Notice and the UK Sub-Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof.
(e)       
Amendment
. These terms and conditions may only be amended or modified with the prior approval of HMRC and in accordance with the UK Sub-Plan.
13.          
UK Tax Consequences
. Set forth below is a brief summary of certain UK tax consequences of exercise of the option and disposition of the Shares under the laws in effect as of March 2008. THIS SUMMARY IS BASED ON THE OPTIONEE BEING RESIDENT, ORDINARILY RESIDENT AND DOMICILED IN THE UK AT GRANT, IT IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. OPTIONEE SHOULD SEEK PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.
(a)       
Exercise of Stock Option
. No UK income tax will be payable on the exercise of an option provided the UK Sub-Plan remains approved by the HMRC, and at least three years and no more than seven years have elapsed from the Date of Grant.
 
No UK income tax will be payable on the exercise of an option within three years of the Grant Date if the right to exercise arises because of the Optionee ceasing employment due to disability or retirement and the option is exercised within six months of leaving.
 
If there is a liability to income tax, the Optionee will be chargeable to income tax on (broadly) the difference between the market value of the Shares acquired and the option price paid for them. If income tax is due, it will need to be withheld by the employer under PAYE. There will also be National Insurance Contributions payable.
 
(b)       
Disposal of Shares.
On a disposal of the Shares following exercise in an approved manner, capital gains tax will be payable on the difference between the price realized on sale and the exercise price of the shares (subject to the annual exemption which may be available).
 
 
 
 
On a disposal of the Shares following exercise where an income tax charge arose, capital gains tax will be payable on the difference between the price realized on sale and the value of the Shares at the date of exercise subject to certain exemptions which may be available.

TEWKSBURY, Mass.,
July 24, 2008  Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today reported revenue of $222.9 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2008, compared to $225.3
million for the same period in 2007. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $10.4 million, or $.28 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $6.0 million, or $.15 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007.
 
GAAP net loss in the second quarter of 2008 included $10.5 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per share were $.00. For the second quarter of 2007, GAAP net loss included $14.2 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal settlements and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $.20 in the second quarter of 2007.
 
At June 30, 2008, the company's cash balance was $138.5 million, down $86.0 million since the end of 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, the company used $93.2 million in cash to repurchase 4.3 million shares of common stock under the previously-announced share buyback program.
 
"Our sequential improvement in revenue, margin and earnings in the second quarter is an indication that our transformation is on schedule," said Gary Greenfield, Avid chairman and CEO. "In the second half of the year, we plan to build on our strengths in both audio and video and align the organization to better position the company for long-term sustainable value."
 
Revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 was $421.1 million, compared to revenue of $444.2 million for the same period in 2007. GAAP net loss for the first six months of 2008 was $31.5 million, or $.83 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $6.0 million, or $.15 per share, for the same period in 2007. GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 included $19.9 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP loss per share was $.30 per share for the first half of 2008.

Recent Highlights
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation for net income and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Avid Announces Fourth Quarter 2008 Results
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass.,
January 29, 2009  Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) today reported revenues of $206.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2008, compared to $258.5 million for the same period in 2007. Preliminary GAAP net loss for the quarter was $31.9 million, or $.86 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $3.9 million, or $.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Preliminary GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 included goodwill and intangible asset non-cash impairment charges associated with the company's Consumer Video segment, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, net gains from product line divestitures and related taxes collectively totaling $22.6 million. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net loss was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter, or $.25 per share. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge related to the Consumer Video segment was estimated at $9.6 million. Therefore the 2008 GAAP results are preliminary and there may be additional charges recorded in the three-month period ended December 31, 2008 as the company completes its annual impairment analysis for all of its business segments. The company's non-GAAP results would not be impacted by any additional impairment charges resulting from this analysis.
 
"We have completed our internal reorganization and we have made great progress executing on our strategy, which we believe will have a positive impact on our business as we move forward, both for our customers and shareholders," said Gary Greenfield, Avid's chairman and CEO. "While the economic climate in 2009 will be challenging, the changes we have made to our company put us in a better position to meet these challenges."
 
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $844.9 million compared to revenues of $929.6 million for 2007. The 2008 revenues include $61.5 million of revenues associated with divested or discontinued product lines. Preliminary GAAP net loss for 2008 was $129.8 million, or $3.46 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $8.0 million, or $.19 per share, for 2007. Preliminary GAAP net loss for 2008 includes $104.6 million of impairment charges, amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, net gains from divested product lines and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net loss for 2008 was $25.2 million, or $.67 per share.
 
 
 
At the end of 2008, the company's cash balance was $147.7 million, up $25.3 million since the end of the third quarter of 2008 primarily related to the receipt of $28.8 million of proceeds from product line divestitures.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation for net income and earnings per share for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Avid Files Annual Report on Form 10-K with SEC
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass.,
March 16, 2009  Avid Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVID) announced today the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The preliminary financial results announced on January 29, 2009 have been finalized upon review of the company's impairment analysis. The analysis resulted in an additional non-cash impairment charge of $69.1 million for 2008, bringing the total charges for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill to $78.7 million for the fourth quarter and $130.0 million for the full year. The company also reduced its previously reported restructuring charge for the fourth quarter by $0.8 million based on a refinement of the estimate.
 
The non-GAAP results for the company were not affected by these changes.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains a reference to "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  The reconciliation for net income and earnings per share for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management
 
 
 
compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures its press releases.

CURRENT REPORT
 
PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): March 17, 2009
 
AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.
(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e)        (i)         On March 17, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Company's 2009 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan. All of the Company's executive officers, with limited exceptions, are eligible to participate in the Plan. There are two categories of Plan participants: (1) "BU Participants," which comprise the executive officers in the Company's Audio, Video and Customer Success business units, and (2) "Corporate Participants," which comprise all other participants.
Under the Plan, each participant is assigned a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of his or her base salary paid in 2009. These percentages vary among participants within the range of 60%-100%.
Bonus payouts under the Plan will be determined (i) for each Corporate Participant, by the financial performance of the Company, and (ii) for each BU Participant, by the financial performance of both the Company and his or her business unit. Financial performance will be measured using the following metrics, with each metric assigned a weight, as set forth below:
 
Actual performance for all plan metrics, other the revenues, will be determined on a non-GAAP basis consistent with historical company practice. For each metric, the Committee has established minimum, target and maximum performance levels. Each metric will receive a score between 0.00 and 1.35 based upon achievement of these performance levels, with a score of 1.00 representing the target performance level. These scores will be used in a weighted average formula to calculate each participant's overall score, which will be multiplied by each participant's target bonus amount to determine his or her actual bonus payout for 2009. Each participant may earn up to 135% of his or her target bonus amount under the Plan. Bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2010 after the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but in no event later than December 31, 2010. Each participant must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2009 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company has an operating loss for 2009, all bonus payouts under the Plan will be reduced to zero.
Nothing in the Plan limits the discretion of the Board or the Committee to approve and pay out additional or alternative bonuses to participants based on performance or provide participants additional or alternative incentives outside of the terms of the Plan.
The preceding description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

(ii)       On March 17, 2009, the Committee approved a one-time payment of $300,000 to Gary G. Greenfield, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to cover additional moving costs in connection with Mr. Greenfield's relocation from Maryland to Massachusetts.
(ii)       On March 17, 2009, the Section 162(m) Subcommittee of the Committee granted 9,500 restricted stock units ("RSUs") to Ken Sexton, the Company's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share. The RSUs were granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The RSUs will vest in full upon the earlier of (a) March 17, 2010 and (b) the first date on which the company publicly announces a non-GAAP operating profit for a completed 2009 fiscal quarter.

Exhibit 10.1
 
AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Avid Technology Park
One Park West
Tewksbury, MA 01876
2009 EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN
On March 17, 2009 (the "
Effective Date
"), the Compensation Committee (the "
Committee
") of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the "
Company
") adopted this 2009 Executive Bonus Plan (the "
Plan
").
The purpose of this Plan is: (i) to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate its executive officers, and (ii) to reward its executive officers for their contributions toward the achievement of certain Company and business unit financial goals. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "
Company
," as used in this Plan, includes any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.
The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan, except as otherwise set forth herein. The Committee may interpret and construe the Plan, decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan, and correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent it deems expedient to carry the Plan into effect. Additionally, the Committee may amend, suspend, revoke or terminate the Plan at any time. All bonus payouts under the Plan are subject to prior approval by the Committee. All decisions by the Committee will be made in the Committee's sole discretion and will be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan.
All of the Company's executive officers will be eligible to participate in the Plan, excluding executive officers hired after September 30, 2009. Eligible executive officers must be employed by the Company on December 31, 2009 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under this Plan. An eligible executive officer who ceases to be employed by the Company, other than as a result of termination by the Company for cause, after December 31, 2009, but prior to the bonus payout date, will be entitled to receive a bonus pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan. For purposes of the Plan, the following individuals will be deemed to be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2009: (i) any executive officer on an approved leave of absence on that date, and (ii) any executive officer who in 2009 becomes disabled and qualifies for benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan. For individuals who become executive officers of the Company during 2009 as a result of an acquisition, initial eligibility for participation in the Plan will be determined by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. Each eligible executive officer is deemed a "
Participant
" in the Plan.
There are two categories of Participants: (1) "
BU Participants,
" which comprise the Vice President and General Manager, Audio; the Vice President and General Manager, Video; and the Vice President of Customer Success, and (2) "
Corporate Participants,
" which comprise all Participants other than BU Participants.
 
 
Each Participant has been designated by the Company as being eligible to earn a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of the Participant's base salary (the "
Bonus Percentage
").
Each Participant's "
Target Bonus Amount
" for 2009 is his or her Bonus Percentage multiplied by the base salary paid to him or her in 2009. For purposes of the Plan, base salary includes regular wages and vacation, sick time and holiday pay, but not leave of absence, bonus or other premium pay.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The score assigned to each Plan Metric will then be multiplied by the relevant Plan Metric weight to determine the weighted score for that Plan Metric. The sum total of these weighted scores, as set forth below, is the "
Overall Score
" (note that there will be one Overall Score for Corporate Participants and separate Overall Scores for each BU Participant):
 
 
(Target Bonus Amount) x (Overall Score) = Bonus Payout
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company has an operating loss for 2009, the bonus payout will be reduced to zero for each Participant.

Avid Announces First Quarter 2009 Results
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass.,
April 23, 2009  Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported revenues of $151.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, compared to $198.3 million for the same period in 2008. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $17.3 million, or $.47 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $21.1 million, or $.54 per share, in the first quarter of 2008.
 
The GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2009 included amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and related tax adjustments, collectively totaling $11.7 million. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $5.6 million for the first quarter, or $.15 per share.
 
"The economic climate continues to be a challenge, however we are making solid progress executing our strategy to transform Avid," said Gary Greenfield, Avid's chairman and CEO. "The steps we've taken to integrate our business have enabled us to begin cultivating deeper partnerships with our customers  from home enthusiasts to large media enterprises  helping us to better understand their needs in terms of interoperability, openness, collaborative production and workflow. When the economy enters a period of recovery, we will be well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities that exist in our markets."
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation for net income and earnings per share for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business
 
in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The above release is subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as Avid's ability to execute on its corporate strategy and meet customer needs, general economic conditions, competitive factors, pricing pressures, delays in product shipments and other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Change in Financial Presentation
Beginning this quarter, we have combined our professional video and consumer video businesses into a single reporting segment. We will now consequently report on two business segments: Audio and Video. Please note that the segment contribution margin calculation has also changed from last year. Segment contribution margin is now calculated as segment gross margin less the research and development and product management expenses directly attributable to the segment. Our 2008 comparative results have been updated to reflect our new business structure.

Avid Announces Second Quarter 2009 Results
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass., July 23, 2009
 Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported revenues of $150.5 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, compared to $222.9 million for the same period in 2008. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $15.9 million, or $.43 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $10.4 million, or $.28 per share, in the second quarter of 2008.
 
The GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2009 included amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and related tax adjustments, collectively totaling $10.4 million. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $5.5 million for the second quarter, or $.15 per share.
 
"We made a number of strategic and operational improvements in the first half of 2009, which have resulted in gross margin improvement and reduced operating costs on a sequential and annual basis," said Gary Greenfield, Avid's chairman and CEO. "While ongoing macroeconomic issues continue to affect our revenue results, we remain confident that our continued efforts to improve our operations have positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities when the economy improves."
 
Revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 were $302.2 million, compared to revenues of $421.1 million for the same period in 2008. GAAP net loss for the first six months of 2009 was $33.2 million, or $.89 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $31.5 million, or $.83 per share, for the same period in 2008. GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 included $22.1 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $.30 for the first half of 2009. GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 included $19.9 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $.30 for the first half of 2008.
 
The company's cash balance on June 30, 2009 was $118.6 million, or approximately $3.18 per share. The company paid out approximately $6.8 million in cash in the second quarter related to restructuring activities.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation
 
for net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.
 
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avid's second quarter 2009 financial results will be held today, July 23, 2009 at 4:30 p.m. ET. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing 719.457.2617 and referencing confirmation code 4569475. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avid's website.

Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The above release is subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about Avid's performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as Avid's ability to execute on its corporate strategy and meet customer needs, general economic conditions, competitive factors, pricing pressures, delays in product shipments and other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Exhibit 99.2  
 
Segment Information: Reclassification of 2008 Disclosures to 2009 Presentation
 
On January 1, 2009, Avid transitioned to a new business structure that combined our previous Professional Video and Consumer Video units into a single Video reporting segment. As a result, our 2009 financial reporting will be based on two reportable segments, Video and Audio. We also consolidated our sales and marketing teams, which had previously been aligned with our reporting segments, into a single customer-facing organization. Consequently, most marketing and selling expenses are no longer managed by or controlled at the segment level and are, therefore, excluded from the calculation of segment contribution margin.
 
We have revised the 2008 segment disclosures to conform to the current presentation. The change to the current presentation did not affect our consolidated operating results. The following table presents our first and second quarter 2009 and revised 2008 revenues and contribution margin by reportable segment, as well as reconciliations of total segment contribution margin to total consolidated operating loss for each of the 2008 periods, that conform to the 2009 presentation:

Avid Announces Third Quarter 2009 Results
 
TEWKSBURY, Mass., October 22, 2009
 Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported revenues of $153.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared to $217.1 million for the same period in 2008. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $16.2 million, or $.43 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $66.4 million, or $1.80 per share, in the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter 2008 results included a non-cash impairment charge of $51.3 million or $1.39 per share.
 
The GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2009 included amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments, collectively totaling $17.0 million. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net income was $787 thousand for the third quarter, or $.02 per share.
 
"We continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives to improve the overall health and efficiency of our operations," said Gary Greenfield, Avid's chairman and CEO. "The third quarter showed sequential improvement in revenue and expanded gross margins, resulting in another quarter of improving results."
 
Revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 were $455.9 million, compared to revenues of $638.2 million for the same period in 2008. GAAP net loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $49.4 million, or $1.33 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $97.9 million, or $2.59 per share, for the same period in 2008. GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 included $39.1 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $.28 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 included $82.0 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $.42 for the first nine months of 2008.
 
The company's cash balance on September 30, 2009 was $103.0 million, or approximately $2.76 per share. The company paid out approximately $4.9 million in cash in the third quarter related to restructuring activities.
 
Avid also announced that its Audit Committee is overseeing an investigation concerning the manner in which revenue was recognized on certain shipments of Audio products near the end of previous quarters from certain warehouses outside the United States. Based on the current progress of the investigation, Avid believes that there have been errors that affected the timing but not the amount of revenue recognized, and that correction of the errors likely will not have a material impact on its financial statements for the current or any prior period. This investigation was only recently commenced. Avid's expectations concerning the nature and materiality of these or any other errors are subject to change based on the final outcome of the investigation.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains "non-GAAP financial measures" under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation for net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 are in the tables attached to this press release.
 
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the company's operations. The company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the company's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.
 
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avid's third quarter 2009 financial results will be held today, October 22, 2009 at 4:30 p.m. ET. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing 719.457.2617 and referencing confirmation code 4569475. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avid's website.

Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The above release is subject to the completion and results of the audit committee's investigation described above and the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about the anticipated impact of the audit committee's investigation described above, and these statements are subject to the outcome of such investigation. This release also makes forward-looking statements about Avid's performance. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, such as Avid's ability to execute on its corporate strategy and meet customer needs, general economic conditions, competitive factors, pricing pressures, delays in product shipments and other important events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Avid Announces Final Financial Results for 2009 Third Quarter
TEWKSBURY, Mass., November 16, 2009
 Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported final financial results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009. These results reflect corrections of errors identified in its previously announced investigation concerning the timing of recognition of revenue. As a result of these errors, Avid has determined that it has a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of its controls and procedures in Europe relating to ensuring that revenue is recognized only after transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer.
Avid reported revenues of $152.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared to $217.1 million for the same period in 2008. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $17.2 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $66.4 million, or $1.80 per share, in the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter 2008 results included a non-cash impairment charge of $51.3 million or $1.39 per share.
The GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2009 included amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments, collectively totaling $17.0 million. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $215 thousand for the third quarter, or $0.01 per share.
Revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 were $454.3 million, compared to revenues of $638.2 million for the same period in 2008. GAAP net loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $50.4 million, or $1.35 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $97.9 million, or $2.59 per share, for the same period in 2008.
GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 included $39.1 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.30 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended
 
September 30, 2008 included $82.0 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.42 for the first nine months of 2008.
The changes to the results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009 when compared to the results reported by Avid on October 22, 2009 are that revenues were decreased by $1.6 million and gross profit was decreased by $1.1 million. Since these adjustments were related to timing of revenue recognition, and not amount, the revenue and related gross profit will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. Additionally, income taxes were reduced by $0.1 million.

Tenant shall be permitted, on an unreserved first-come first-served basis, to use up to 3.6 spaces per 1000 rentable square feet of the Premises in the parking area serving the Building, or in a parking area reasonably proximate to the Building.  Landlord will not grant any other new tenant of the Building a greater parking ratio than granted to Tenant, or reserved or exclusive parking rights.  If Landlord does grant any other new tenant greater rights than those afforded Tenant under this paragraph, then Landlord shall also grant Tenant similar rights, on a pro rata basis.
 
Landlord reserves the right from time to time, without unreasonable interference with use of the Premises:  (a)  to install, use, maintain, repair, replace and relocate for service to the Premises and other parts of the Building, or either, pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, wherever located in the Premises or Building, (b)  to alter or relocate any other common facility, (c)  to make any repairs and replacements to the Premises which Landlord may deem necessary, and (d)  in connection with any excavation made upon adjacent land of Landlord or others, to enter, and to license others to enter, upon the Premises to do such work as the person causing such excavation deems necessary to preserve the wall of the Building from injury or damage and to support the same.  In exercising such rights, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize inconvenience to Tenant's operations in the Premises.
 
  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for the Original Term, which shall begin on the Commencement Date,  and end on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided.  The term "Substantially Completed" as used herein shall mean that the work to be performed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit C and the Final Plans has been completed with the exception of minor items which can be fully completed without material interference with Tenant and other items which because of the season or weather or the nature of the item are not practicable to do at the time, provided that none of said items is necessary to make the Premises tenantable for the Permitted Uses, the Premises are delivered broom clean and free of all occupants and personal property, and a Certificate of Occupancy (which may be a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, provided that Landlord uses diligence to obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy within a reasonable time) has been issued by the Town of Burlington and all other requirements of "Substantial Completion" set forth in Section 3.8 have been completed. However, if Landlord cannot obtain a temporary

 Lease Year have been determined, as well as the notice dates for exercising the Extension Option and the Contraction Option, such dates shall be evidenced by a document, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and executed by Landlord and Tenant.  If Landlord's Work in the Premises is Substantially Completed prior to completion of the other Avid Spaces, and Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business nonetheless, then the Commencement Date for the Premises under this Lease will be deemed to have occurred as of the date of Tenant's occupancy.  In that event, the first Lease Year under this Lease shall be extended by the number of days necessary to make the last day of such first Lease Year the same as the last day of the first lease year under the Building 75 Lease or the 10 North Lease, whichever lease has a first lease year expiring latest.
or permanent certificate of occupancy by the Target Commencement Date because of a Tenant Delay (defined in Section 3.1.B below), then the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have occurred and the Landlord's Work deemed to be "Substantially Completed" on the date that such work would have been Substantially Completed but for such Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work and obtain a permanent certificate of occupancy).  When the Commencement Date, the Expiration Date, the Rent Commencement Dates, the beginning and end of the 1
st
 
The term "Lease Year" as used herein shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive full calendar months.  The first Lease Year shall begin on the Commencement Date if the Commencement Date is the first day of a calendar month; if not, then the first Lease Year shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the Commencement Date occurs.  Each succeeding Lease Year shall commence upon the anniversary date of the first Lease Year.
 
  Reference is made to the fact that Wing B of the Building 75 Premises is currently leased to and occupied by Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") pursuant to a lease dated June 27, 2007 (the "Sun Lease"), between Landlord's affiliate, the Building 75 Landlord and Sun for premises in certain buildings in the Park, including Wing B of Building 75.  Pursuant to the terms the Sun Lease, Sun has elected to contract its premises and surrender Wing B effective as of June 30, 2010.  Landlord, the Building 75 Landlord, the 10 North Ave Landlord and Tenant now desire that Sun accelerate the surrender date to January 31, 2010.  Therefore, it is an express condition precedent to this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the 10 North Lease that Sun shall agree to an earlier termination and surrender of Wing B of Building 75 and execute a letter agreement to that effect (the "Sun Letter Agreement"). Landlord shall use diligent efforts to obtain the Sun Letter Agreement as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the Sun Letter Agreement is not executed by Landlord and Sun and a copy delivered to Tenant by the date that is ten (10) days after the full execution of this Lease, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the 10 North Lease by giving Landlord written notice of termination any time after the expiration of such 10-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement.  If Tenant gives such notice, then this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the 10 North Lease shall be terminated immediately as of the date of Tenant's notice.  If Tenant has not elected to so terminate the leases, and Landlord, despite having used diligent efforts, has not obtained a fully executed Sun Letter Agreement by the date that is 30 days after full execution of this Lease, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the 10 North Lease by giving Tenant written notice of termination at any time after the expiration of such 30-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement, such termination to be effective immediately as of the date of the notice.  If this Lease and the Building 75 Lease and the 10 North Lease are terminated by either party, no documentation other than a party's notice of termination shall be required to effectuate such termination, and neither party shall have any liability to the other on account of termination.
2.2.1
                       
Condition Precedent.
 
A.  Tenant shall have two options (each, an "Extension Option") to extend the term of this Lease, each for an additional period of five (5) years.  The first such fiveyear period (the "First Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, and the second such five-year period (the "Second Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the First Extended Term, provided that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:
2.3
                                
Extension Option.
 
 
All of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease shall apply to each Extended Term except that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for each such Extended Term shall be the then- fair market rental rate for premises of comparable size and quality to the Premises, in comparable buildings in the competitive market area as of the commencement of the applicable Extended Term (the "Fair Market Rate"), excluding the annual charge-off for the Connector Bridge pursuant to Section 3.8 below, but in no event less than the
B.
                                    
average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the term immediately preceding the Extended Term in question.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate during the First Extended Term shall be no less than $28.04 per rentable square foot of Premises (i.e., the average rental rate per rentable square foot of Premises during the Original Term), and during the Second Extended Term, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate shall be no less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the First Extended Term.  In addition, it is expressly understood and agreed that the annual charge-off for the amortized cost of the Connector Bridge pursuant to Section 3.8 below is payable in addition to and apart from the Fixed Rent during the Term and shall not be included in the determination of the Fair Market Rent during any Extended Term.  At the time of commencement of an Extended Term, Tenant's Base Operating Costs shall be revised to be Operating Costs for first full calendar year of the Extended Term, grossed up if necessary to reflect full occupancy, and Base Taxes shall be revised to be Taxes for the first fiscal year which begins during the first Lease Year of the Extended Term, grossed up if necessary to reflect full assessment.  If Tenant shall elect to exercise an Extension Option, it shall do so by giving Landlord written notice (the "Extension Notice") of its election not later than fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, or fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the First Extended Term, as the case may be.  If Tenant gives such notice and satisfies the conditions specified above, the extension of this Lease shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional documents, but the parties subsequently shall enter into a lease amendment as contemplated under Section 2.3.F below.  The Original Term and each Extended Term are hereinafter collectively sometimes called the "Term" or the "term".
 
Not later than fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term or the First Extended Term, as applicable, Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rate for the applicable Extended Term.  Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord gives Tenant Landlord's proposal for Fair Market Rate, Tenant shall notify Landlord whether Tenant accepts or disputes such rate.  If Tenant disagrees with Landlord's designation, Landlord and Tenant shall commence negotiations to agree upon the Fair Market Rate.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on the Fair Market Rate within thirty (30) days after the date on which Landlord first gave Tenant Landlord's proposal for the Fair Market Rate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be determined as provided below.
C.
                                    
 
If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the Fair Market Rate by the end of said thirty (30)-day period, then within five (5) days thereafter, Landlord and Tenant shall each simultaneously submit to the other in a sealed envelope its good faith estimate of the Fair Market Rate, including anticipated steps in rent, if any.  If the higher of such estimates is not more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the other estimate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be the average of the two estimates. If the matter is not resolved by the exchange of estimates, then Fair Market Rate shall be determined by an independent arbitrator as set forth below.
D.
                                   
 
Within seven (7) days after the exchange of estimates, the parties shall select, as an arbitrator, a mutually acceptable commercial real estate broker or appraiser licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts specializing in the field of commercial office leasing in the suburban Boston area, having no less than ten (10) years' experience (an "Approved Arbitrator").  If the parties cannot agree on such person, then within a second period of seven (7) days, each shall select one Approved Arbitrator and the two appointed Arbitrators shall, within five (5) days, select a third Approved Arbitrator who shall be the final decision-maker (the "Final Arbitrator").  If one party shall fail to timely make such appointment, then the person chosen by the other party shall be the sole arbitrator. Once the Final Arbitrator has been selected as provided for above, then, as soon thereafter as practicable, but in any case within fourteen (14) days after his or her appointment, the arbitrator shall determine the Fair Market Rate by selecting either the Landlord's estimate of Fair Market Rate or the Tenant's estimate of Fair Market Rate.  Such arbitrator must choose the proposed Fair Market Rate that he/she determines is closest to the actual market rental rate for the Premises, taking into account that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate must in no event be less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the immediately preceding term, as specifically set forth in Section 2.3 (B). There shall be no discovery or similar proceedings. The arbitrator's decision as to which estimate shall be the Fair Market Rate for the Extended Term shall be rendered in writing to both Landlord and Tenant and shall be final and binding upon them and shall be the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for the Extended Term.  The costs of the Final Arbitrator will be equally divided between Landlord and Tenant.  Any fees of any counsel engaged by Landlord or Tenant, however, shall be borne by the party that retained such counsel.
E.
                                     
 
Once the Fair Market Rate has been determined, the parties shall promptly execute an amendment to this Lease setting forth the Fixed Rent for the Premises during the applicable Extended Term.  For any part of the Extended Term during which the Fixed Rent Rate is in dispute, or has not yet been finally determined, Tenant shall make payments to Landlord on account of Fixed Rent at the rate per square foot of Rentable Floor Area of the Premises last paid under this Lease.  The parties shall adjust for any overpayments or underpayments upon final determination of such rent.
F.
                                     
 
Tenant shall have the option (the "Contraction Option") to contract the Premises by surrendering in its entirety Wing A of the 2 floor of the Building or the portion of Wing A of the 1 floor of the Building that is then leased to Tenant (the "Contraction Space"), effective as of the last day of the 7th Lease Year (the "Effective Contraction Date").  If Tenant elects to exercise its Contraction Option, Tenant shall do so by giving Landlord written notice (the "Contraction Notice") no later than the last day of the 6th Lease Year.  If Tenant properly and timely gives the Contraction Notice, then as of the Effective Contraction Date, Tenant shall, at its expense, separately demise the Contraction Space from the remainder of the Premises, including separately metering as necessary, and Tenant shall vacate and yield up the Contraction Space in accordance with the terms and requirements of Section 6.1.9 of this Lease, with its
2.4
                                
Contraction Option.
nd
st
failure to do so being treated as a holdover under Section 6.1.9.  From and after the Effective Contraction Date, the Contraction Space shall no longer be included in the Premises and shall be deemed deleted from this Lease.
 
  A.  During the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall have an ongoing right of first offer to lease the ROFO Space (hereinafter defined) as it becomes available for lease after the Date of this Lease, subject to the terms and conditions contained below.
2.5
                                
Right of First Offer.
 
"ROFO Space" shall mean all tenant space in the Building.  Tenant's rights shall be subject to all rights of E-Dialog to lease such space, as identified in Exhibit I attached hereto, whether by expansion, extension, rights of first offer, or otherwise, but shall be superior to all other tenant's rights (without limiting the foregoing, Landlord acknowledges that Tenant's superior rights hereunder apply with respect to space for which a lease is expiring, whether or not Landlord and such tenant desire to extend that tenant's lease of such space).  With respect to space that is vacant and not subject to a lease as of the Date of this Lease, as shown on Exhibit I attached hereto. Tenant's rights under this Section 2.5 shall arise only after the expiration of any lease for such space entered into after the Date of this Lease.
B.
                                    
 
If any ROFO Space becomes available to lease during the Term of this Lease and Landlord desires to market such ROFO Space, then prior to marketing such space, Landlord shall first notify Tenant in writing of the opportunity to lease such ROFO Space, on the condition that (i) Tenant has not subleased as of the date of Landlord's notification more than 10% of the Premises and the Building 75 Premises in the aggregate , (ii) Tenant has not previously been in default of its monetary obligations under this Lease beyond the expiration of all applicable grace and cure periods hereunder during the 5-year period preceding the time any ROFO Space becomes available, (iii) Tenant had not previously exercised the Contraction Right, and (iv) Tenant confirms that, during the immediately preceding fiscal year of Tenant prior to the date of Landlord's notification pursuant to this paragraph, Tenant has had a net income, adjusted for the impairment of goodwill, as shown on Tenant's Consolidated Statement of Operations in its audited annual report (proof of which shall be provided to Landlord as set forth in the next paragraph below).
C.
                                    
 
Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord's written notification, Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord indicating whether it is interested in the possibility of leasing such ROFO Space, including its most recent annual reports, or if Tenant is no longer a publicly traded company, an audited statement reporting satisfaction of the requirement of clause (iv) of Paragraph C above.  If Tenant timely so indicates its interest in the offered space, and satisfies the condition precedent set forth in subparagraph (C), then Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing ("Landlord's Offer Notice") specifying all material terms on which Landlord intends to offer to lease the ROFO Space to the general market except that the term of the ROFO Space will be coterminous with the then remaining portion of the Term of this Lease.  Landlord's offer notice shall identify the ROFO Space and the terms of the offer in reasonable detail and shall include Landlord's determination of the market rate for the ROFO Space.  Tenant shall within fifteen (15) days after the date of Landlord's Offer Notice either accept or decline such offer in writing, with Tenant's failure to respond within such fifteen (15) day period being deemed to be an election to decline the offer.
D.
                                   
 
If Tenant has declined Landlord's offer or is deemed to have declined, then Landlord shall be free to offer the subject ROFO Space to the general market.  However, if Tenant has declined or is deemed to have declined the offer, Landlord shall deliver a new Landlord's Offer Notice prior to entering into a lease for any such ROFO Space that provides for an effective rent that is 95% or less than the effective rent specified in the initial Landlord's Offer Notice for the ROFO Space, or is otherwise on terms materially more favorable to the prospective tenant than the terms contained in Landlord's Offer Notice.  If Landlord has not entered into a lease for the ROFO Space within 180 days after the date of Tenant's decline or deemed decline of the offer, then Tenant's rights under this Section 2.5 shall again apply with respect to such ROFO Space.
E.
                                     
 
If Tenant timely elects to lease such ROFO Space, then the space shall, without further action by the parties, be leased by Tenant on the terms and conditions set forth in the Landlord's Offer Notice, and otherwise on all of the other terms and conditions of the Lease, and the parties shall memorialize such facts with a lease amendment.
F.
                                     
 
If there are fewer than 36 months remaining in the Term at the time of any Landlord's Offer Notice, Landlord shall have the option to require Tenant to concurrently exercise its next Extension Option if Tenant intends to accept the ROFO Space. In such event, Landlord's Offer Notice will specify the terms on which Landlord intends to lease the ROFO Space during the remainder of the Term, but will also stipulate that the term for the ROFO Space will be extended by the applicable 5-year Extended Term, and will include Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rate (as defined in Section 2.3) for the entire Premises, as enlarged by the ROFO Space, during the applicable Extended Term.  The Annual Fixed Rent Rate for the entire Premises, including the ROFO Space, during the applicable Extended Term will be determined in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.3 (B) for determining the Annual Fixed Rent Rate during an Extended Term.  Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Landlord's Offer Notice, in writing, either (i) accept such offer, including exercising the First Extension Option at the rental rate stated in Landlord's Offer Notice, or (ii) decline the offer in its entirety.  It is expressly understood that Tenant shall have no right to arbitrate Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rate stipulated in the Landlord's Offer Notice, and Paragraphs (D) and (E) of Section 2.3 shall have no force or effect with respect to this Section 2.5.  If there are fewer than 36 months remaining in the Term and Tenant has no remaining Extension Option, then Tenant shall have no further rights to any ROFO Space under this Section 2.5.

ARTICLE 3
Improvements
 
 Landlord shall, at its sole cost, cause to be performed the work to demise the Second Floor Premises, and Wing B on the first floor and Wing A on the first floor, substantially as shown on the Schematic Design Plans attached hereto, and to install in the Premises check-meters for utilities and chilled water for Tenant's special needs areas, and shall insure that all restrooms and access/egress ways are in compliance with applicable building codes, including those requiring removal of architectural barriers to disabled persons (all of the foregoing is called, the "Base Building Work").  All Landlord's Base Building Work shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner employing building standard materials and finishes, with reasonable upgrades to the demising work to be compatible with existing conditions, in Landlord's discretion.
3.1
  A.
                                
Base Building Work; Tenant Improvement Work.
 
Landlord shall cause to be performed the alterations and improvements desired by Tenant to prepare the Premises for Tenant's use (the "TIW") substantially in accordance with Schematic Design Plans attached hereto as Exhibit C and pursuant to the Final Plans.  The TIW will be performed at Landlord's expense up to the TI Allowance and subject to payment by Tenant of the Tenant's Share (defined in Section 3.4). The TI Allowance may be applied at Tenant's discretion toward architectural and engineering fees, the construction management fee to Nordblom Development Company (referred to below), consulting fees, hard construction costs, air-conditioning and special electrical power distribution, telephone and security systems and the cost of furniture, fixtures or equipment.  All Base Building Work and the TIW (collectively, the "Landlord's Work") shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable building laws.  Tenant shall have the right to require Landlord to use, to the extent practical and where possible, the existing building materials and equipment currently on-site within the Premises and the so-called "attic stock" elsewhere within the Building.  An inventory of such equipment is attached hereto as Exhibit J.  Tenant shall advise Landlord on or before November 24, 2009 which items listed in the attached inventory Tenant desires, and all other inventory items not selected by Tenant shall be removed from the Premises prior to delivery of the Premises to Tenant.  Tenant agrees that Landlord may make any non-material changes in the Landlord's Work which may become reasonably necessary or advisable to accommodate field conditions or to substitute materials of equal or better quality to meet availability schedules, without approval of Tenant, provided written notice is promptly given to Tenant; and Landlord may make other changes in such work reasonably necessary to accommodate unforeseen conditions, with the written approval of Tenant, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Landlord shall use diligence to cause Landlord's Work to be Substantially Completed by the Target Commencement Date, subject to Force Majeure events (defined in Section 10.5 hereof) and any Tenant Delay (defined below).  Tenant shall be required to pay to Nordblom Development Company a project management fee equal to 1.5% of the total construction cost of the TIW excluding project management costs, costs for architectural and engineering fees, moving costs and telecommunications wiring and cabling costs.  It is understood that the phrases "TIW", "Landlord's Work" and the "Final Plans," referred to in this Article 3 shall mean the tenant improvement work and the plans for both the Premises and the Building 75 Premises together as one integrated tenant improvement project, with the exception of Sections 3.8 and 3.9 where the meanings of such terms shall only be applicable to the Premises.
B.
                                    
 
The phrase, "Tenant Delay", shall be defined as any delay in the completion of Landlord's Work actually caused by (i) special work, upgrades or long lead-time items for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay, and in either instance Tenant does not withdraw or alter such special work, upgrade, long lead-time item which avoids such delay, (ii) any changes to any plans, including the Final Plans, made by Tenant, or any Tenant's Change Order, in any case for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay at the time of its approval and for which Tenant does not withdraw such change to avoid delay, (iii) any change in the design of the TIW or any component thereof made by Tenant that results in a delay in the Landlord's construction start date beyond January 3, 2010, (iv) the delay of Tenant or its architects and engineers in providing or approving the Construction Plans or the Proposed GMP, or supplying, submitting or approving any other plans, specifications, pricing or estimates or giving authorizations or supplying information reasonably required by Landlord or its General Contractor or the Town of Burlington by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1, and in this Article 3, or in any other instance if no time period is specified, then within three (3) business days after request therefor, (v) any failure by any contractors employed by Tenant including, without limitation, contractors furnishing telecommunications, data processing or other service or equipment directly to Tenant (and not via Landlord's contractors) to comply with the agreed upon timetables for coordination of the parties' respective components of work, as established at on-site progress meetings between Landlord's representative and Tenant's representative, each acting reasonably and in good faith, (vi) any failure to comply with this Article 3 or any material interference with the performance of Landlord's Work by Tenant or any of its agents, employees, architects, engineers or contractors, or (vii) Tenant's delay in delivering the Original Letter of Credit required pursuant to Section 4.4. No event shall constitute a "Tenant Delay" unless Landlord advises Tenant in writing (which may be by email with a copy to Paul.Jakubowski@WilmerHale.com) of such event within three (3) business days after Landlord becomes aware of its occurrence; however, Landlord need not give Tenant notice of any failure of Tenant to act by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1 and in this Article 3, it being acknowledged that a failure to timely act by such stipulated dates is a "Tenant Delay on a day for day basis.
C.
                                    
ipso facto
 
A.  In the event that Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by July 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent first coming due as of the Rent Commencement Date shall be abated by one day for each day of delay during the period beginning on July 1, 2010, and ending on the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  If Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by August 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 2 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on August 1,
3.2
                                
Late Delivery.
2010, and continuing until the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  Further, if the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by September 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event,  then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 3 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on September 1, 2010 and continuing until the day Landlord's Work is Substantially Complete.
 
If the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by October 31, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then Tenant may elect to perform the incomplete Landlord's Work itself, utilizing the funds held under the Construction Escrow Agreement for any incomplete TIW, and with any reasonable expenditures for the completion of the Base Building Work (estimated costs being $42,000.00 for demising and $50,000.00 for sub-metering), to be reimbursed by Landlord within 30 days after Tenant's request therefor with back-up documentation to substantiate the request, failing which, Tenant shall have the right to offset such expenditures against the Fixed Rent next coming due as of the Initial Premises Rent Commencement Date, except that such monthly offset shall not exceed fifteen (15%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated in Section 1.1.
B.
                                    
 
If the Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by May 31, 2011, despite Landlord having used diligent efforts to complete the Landlord's Work, and provided the reason for Landlord's inability to complete such work by May 31, 2011 is not due solely to Tenant Delay, then either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to the other party.  If either party timely and properly gives the termination notice, then this Lease shall terminate immediately upon the date of a party's notice.
C.
                                    
 
A. Tenant shall be solely responsible for the preparation and submission to Landlord of (a) the Schematic Design Plans, (b) a full set of architectural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing, construction, design development drawings, including demolition plans sufficient for pricing and permitting, equivalent in design completion to more than 50% of the TIW Plans (the "Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans"), and (c) a full CD set of architectural and MEP construction plans and specifications sufficient to permit and construct the TIW, including the electrical upgrade work and the Cooling Plant and construction control affidavits (called "TIW Plans"), and all other information reasonably required by Landlord and the General Contractor (defined below) necessary obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington and otherwise to perform and complete the TIW.  All plans shall emanate from and be consistent with the approved Schematic Design Plan attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Tenant has assured itself by direct communication with the architect and engineers that the Design Development/Permitting/Pricing Plans can be submitted to Landlord by the respective date set forth in Section 1.1.  Additionally, Tenant agrees to cause the TIW Plans to be delivered to Landlord for review before the Final Plans Date and agrees to devote such time as may be necessary in consultation with said architect and engineers to enable them to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.  Tenant shall cause its architect and engineers to cooperate with Landlord and the General Contractor, as reasonably necessary to enable Landlord to obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington for the TIW by January 2, 2010.  Tenant shall also cause its architects and engineers to reasonably cooperate with Landlord or the General Contractor, as applicable, as reasonably necessary to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy from the Town of Burlington. Time is of the essence in respect of the preparation and submission of all plans by Tenant.  If in Landlord's judgment, Tenant's architects and engineers are not cooperating fully or progressing diligently, then Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to engage its own architects and engineers to complete any necessary plans and to supply information, and the like to obtain a building permit by January 2, 2010, or to meet construction schedules and to otherwise avoid delay, but such right to take action on Tenant's behalf to speed the approval process shall not entitle Landlord to make material changes to the Final Plans (defined in paragraph B below); provided, however, if the Town of Burlington requires any change to the Final Plans in order to issue a building permit, Tenant shall cooperate reasonably with Landlord to address the Town's concerns and requests.  The fees of any architect and engineer engaged by Landlord pursuant to the preceding sentence will be paid by Tenant within thirty (30) days after invoice from Landlord.
3.3
                                
Plans and Specifications
 
All plans shall require Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.  Landlord shall give Tenant notice, in reasonable detail, of any reasonable objections or concerns Landlord may have with respect to any plans or revised plan, within ten (10) business days after submission by Tenant of its plans and all necessary supporting information.  Landlord shall not be deemed unreasonable for withholding or conditioning approval of plans which (i) involve or are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect any structural element or exterior element of the Building or any portion thereof, or (ii)are reasonably likely, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, to materially adversely affect the value of the Building or any portion thereof, or (iii) are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the proper functioning of the Building systems.  If Landlord objects to any plans, or any portion thereof,  Tenant shall cause the plans to be revised in a manner sufficient to remedy Landlord's objections and respond to Landlord's concerns and redelivered to Landlord within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice of objection.  The aforesaid process shall be repeated until the plans are approved by Landlord.  The final TIW Plans approved by Landlord shall be called the "Final Plans" and will be used to obtain a building permit for the TIW.  Tenant shall use diligence to submit the TIW Plans and any revisions in order to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.

It is understood that totality of the tenant improvement work being performed in the Premises and in the Building 75 Premises is one integrated construction project pursuant to a single construction contract, and, for the purposes of this Section 3.4, all references to "TIW" shall mean the aggregate tenant improvement work in the Premises and in the Building 65 Premises as shown on the Final Plans. Landlord shall cause the TIW to be performed by Erland Construction (the "General Contractor") and by major subcontractors (which shall be re-insured) selected and engaged by Landlord and the General Contractor, and approved by Tenant, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to reasonably bid each major trade of subcontractor work involved in the TIW, and shall cause the General Contractor to accept the lowest qualified bid submitted for each such trade unless such bid fails to conform to the Final Plans or if Landlord, Tenant and General Contractor reasonably agree otherwise.  Landlord shall provide Tenant with periodic pricing once Landlord receives the Schematic Design Plans.  Within 14 days after receipt of the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to provide Tenant a proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price (the "Proposed GMP") for the TIW.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the Proposed GMP Tenant shall either give Landlord its written approval of the Proposed GMP, or shall cause the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans to be value engineered and revised by means of a "deductive alternative" process for budget control rather than a redesign effort.  The revised Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans shall be subject to Landlord's approval and shall be submitted by Landlord to General Contractor for revised pricing.  The foregoing process shall be repeated, utilizing the TIW Plans, if necessary, until the Proposed GMP is approved by Tenant in writing.  Tenant agrees to cause its architects and engineers to use diligence to revise the plans as necessary to achieve an approved GMP no later than December 30, 2009 (as approved, the "Contract Price"). It is expressly understood that any delay by Tenant in approving the GMP by December 30, 2009, will constitute a Tenant Delay on a day-for-day basis for each day from December 30, 2009 until the date the GMP is finally approved by Tenant, and if such period of Tenant Delay actually delays Landlord in achieving Substantial Completion of Landlord's Work by June 1, 2010, then Landlord shall have the right to deem the Commencement Date to have occurred on the date that such Landlord's Work would have been Substantially Completed but for such period of Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work and obtain a permanent certificate of occupancy).  Promptly after approval of the Contract Price and receipt of the Final Plans, Landlord shall release the General Contractor to perform the TIW in accordance with the Final Plans at Landlord's cost, subject to payment by Tenant of the amount (the "Tenant's Share") by which the Contract Price (subject to adjustment pursuant to the next paragraph) exceeds the TI Allowance.

Cost of TIW; Tenant's Share.
Subguard
 
Landlord and Tenant have entered into the Construction Escrow Agreement to ensure that funds will be available to pay for the TIW and Connector Bridge.  Within 21 days after the full execution of this Lease, Landlord shall fund $2,379,970.00 (i.e., TI Allowance) plus $1.6M for Connector Bridge into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established pursuant to the terms of the Construction Escrow Agreement, and Tenant shall fund into the Escrow Account the Tenant's Share (adjusted pursuant to the Construction Escrow Agreement once the Tenant's Share is finally determined).  In the event either Landlord or Tenant fails to fully fund its share into the Escrow Account within the aforesaid 21-day period, then the other party may elect to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to the other, effective immediately upon the giving of the notice.
 
After the TIW has been completed, if it is determined that the total payments under the contract with the General Contractor were actually less than the Contract Price, the savings shall be refunded to Tenant, and any savings in the cost of constructing the Connector Bridge shall belong to Landlord, as more specifically set forth in the Construction Escrow Agreement.
 
  Included as part of the TIW, Landlord, through the General Contractor, shall cause to be performed the work required by Tenant to upgrade the electrical capacity at the Premises and increase the cooling capacity at the Premises subject to Landlord's prior written approval of the work to be performed and the plans and specifications therefor, which approval in either case shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent or require certain conditions to be satisfied if Tenant's proposed work (A) is reasonably likely to diminish the electrical supply capacity or the cooling supply capacity of the Central Utility Plant available to other tenants at the Park; (B) does not conform with the aesthetic design of the Park, (C) is reasonably likely to adversely affect the structural integrity of the Building, (D) would require special permits, including an emissions discharge permit, or approvals from the Town of Burlington (excluding site plan approval), (E) is reasonably likely to cause electrical interference with other tenant's uses in the Park or (F) might require noise attenuation or visual screening.
3.5
                                
Tenant's Upgrade Work.
 
  Also included in the TIW, Landlord, through the General Contractor, shall cause to be performed the work to install a cooling plant, which shall include chillers, condensers, and cooling towers

Cooling Plant.
(collectively, the "Cooling Plant"), to serve the Premises located on a pad site between the Building and Building 75, subject to Landlord's approval regarding type, number, size, location, noise attenuation measures, visual screening, and the manner of installation, and in conformance with all requirements of the Town of Burlington, including site plan modification and approval.  Tenant shall at its expense, install a separate meter to measure water and electricity consumption.
 
  After the Final Plans and the Contract Price have been approved, Tenant may elect to propose changes to the Final Plans ("Tenant's Change Order"). Tenant shall submit each proposed Tenant's Change Order to Landlord for its approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided Tenant's requested change will not affect the compliance of the Building or the Premises with applicable laws.  Landlord agrees to respond to any Tenant's Change Order within such time as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances (taking into consideration the information contained in such Change Order), and in any event no later than five (5) business days following submission by Tenant, advising Tenant of any anticipated increase in costs associated with such Tenant Change Order as well as an estimate of any delay in Landlord's Work (it being understood that a delay, if any, in Landlord's Work caused by such Change Order could result in a deemed Commencement Date pursuant to Section 2.1).  Tenant shall then have the right to approve or withdraw such Tenant's Change Order.  If any Tenant's Change Order is approved as aforesaid, and the applicable Tenant Change Order increases the cost of construction, then before implementing any such change, Landlord will prepare a Work Change Order Form, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, setting forth any adjustment in the Contract Price.  To be valid, the Work Change Order Form must be signed by both parties.  Landlord will maintain an accurate log of all Tenant's Change Orders and will invoice Tenant monthly for the cost of each Tenant Change Order.  Tenant will be required to pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt, except for any Tenant's Change Order of $20,000.00 or more, in which case Tenant will deposit such amount into Escrow Account under the Construction Escrow Agreement the cost of such Tenant's Change Order upon signing the Work Change Order Form.  Landlord shall have no obligation to proceed with any Tenant's Change Order until payment is received or made as aforesaid.
3.7
                                
Work Change Orders.
 
Tenant or its representatives may, at reasonable times, enter upon the Premises during the progress of the work to inspect the progress thereof and to determine if the work is being performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.1. Tenant shall promptly give to Landlord notices of any alleged failure by Landlord to comply with those requirements.  Landlord's Work shall be deemed approved by Tenant when Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business, except for items of Landlord's Work which are uncompleted or do not conform to Exhibit C and the Final Plans and as to which Tenant shall, in either case, have given written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the Commencement Date as set forth in a punch-list as set forth below.  A certificate of completion by Landlord's architect or engineer and a Certificate of Occupancy shall be evidence that Landlord's Work has been completed except for items stated in such certificate to be incomplete or not in conformity with Exhibit C and the Final Plans.  Within five (5) days after the Town of Burlington issues a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, Landlord and Tenant shall meet for the purpose of determining the work remaining in order for Landlord to achieve a final Certificate of Occupancy, each acting reasonably and in good faith, and to select a subsequent date for a joint walk-through of the Premises in order to prepare a punch-list identifying items of Landlord's Work which are incomplete (the "Punch-list Items").  Landlord shall cause such Punch-list Items to be completed within thirty (30) days after the preparation of the list by the parties, unless the parties agree upon any longer time periods.  If Tenant notifies Landlord in writing of the existence of a latent defect in Landlord's Work within one year following the Commencement Date, then Landlord at its expense subject to its General Contractor's warranty, will repair such defect.  A "latent defect" is a defect in the construction of the Premises which defect would not ordinarily be observed during a walk-through inspection.
3.8
                                
Acceptance of the Premises.
 
  With Landlord's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Tenant and its agents and architects shall have the right to enter the Premises after full execution and delivery of this Lease during customary business hours and without payment of rent, but otherwise subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, to facilitate Tenant's preparation of its plans for the TIW so long as such work does not interfere with the performance of any Base Building Work or Landlord's Work and is coordinated with Building management.
3.9
                                
Pre-Commencement Entry.
 
A. Landlord agrees to cause to be constructed, at Landlord's sole cost and expense, a connector bridge (the "Connector Bridge") to connect the Building to Building 75, similar in quality, design and scope as the existing bridge between the Building and Building 55.  will work with General Contractor to perform the structural steel work in a design/build manner.  Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to obtain competitive bids for the "main components" of the Connector Bridge work and shall accept the lowest qualified bid unless Tenant agrees otherwise.  The "main components" of the Connector Bridge work are: structural steel, metal deck, steel erection, glazing, metal panel, HVAC (if any), paint, roofing, electric, ceilings, flooring, fire protection, plumbing, drywall, excavation, and concrete work.  Landlord shall use diligent efforts to complete the Connector Bridge by the Commencement Date, subject to Force Majeure, Tenant Delays, and any delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals from the Town of Burlington, including site plan review and approval.  Once the Connector Bridge is completed as evidenced by a Certificate of Occupancy (which may be temporary), an annual charge-off of the amortized cost thereof (on a level payment basis over a 25 year period in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, together with interest on the unamortized balance at the rate of 8% per year) shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, as Additional Rent, in monthly installments during the Term, and any Extended Term, that falls within the amortization period; provided such annual charge-off shall apply only with respect to Landlord's actual, reasonable, out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses in constructing the Connector Bridge, and if such actual, reasonable, out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses exceed the principal amount of $1.6 million in the aggregate, the annual charge-off shall nevertheless be based upon a $1.6 million principal amount.  The annual charge-off is in addition to and independent of the Fixed Rent payable during the Term and shall not be included in determination of the Fair Market Rent during any Extended Term, it being understood that the monthly amortization amount will be payable in addition to the Fixed Rent payable by Tenant

during the Term.
 
If Landlord has not Substantially Completed construction of the Bridge by the date ("the "Outside Bridge Date") that is thirty (30) days after the later of (i) the Commencement Date and (ii) the date Tenant opens for business in the Premises, then Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction in the Fixed Rent coming due under this Lease as of the Initial Premises Rent Commencement Date on a day-for-day basis until the Connector Bridge is Substantially Completed:
B.
                                            
 
 
If Landlord still has not Substantially Completed construction of the Connector Bridge by the date that is ninety (90) days after the later of (i) the Commencement Date or (ii) the date Tenant opens for business in the Premises, then Tenant shall be permitted to complete construction of the Connector Bridge utilizing the funds allocated to the Connector Bridge under the Construction Escrow Agreement, using the General Contractor and in accordance with Landlord's plans and specifications therefor and in compliance with all requirements of the Town of Burlington and otherwise in accordance with applicable laws. If Tenant incurs reasonable costs (excluding construction overtime costs and upgrades) in performing the work in excess of the principle $1.6 Million construction cost of the Connector Bridge, then Tenant shall have the right to offset against payments of Fixed Rent coming due as of the Initial Premises Rent Commencement Date (i) the excess direct costs of the work and, (ii) up to $50,000 in total of any actual, reasonable, third-party out-of-pocket costs incurred by Tenant to complete construction of the Connector Bridge; provided, however, the amount of each such monthly offset shall not exceed fifty (50%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable, as stipulated in Section 1.1.  If Tenant elects to exercise self-help under this Section 3.8, then Tenant may not avail itself of any other remedy at law, in equity or pursuant to any other provision of this Lease.

ARTICLE 4
Rent
 
  Commencing as of the Initial Premises Rent Commencement Date, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay rent to Landlord, by electronic fund transfer (or by such other method, as set forth below, or to such other person or entity as Landlord may by notice in writing to Tenant from time to time direct), at the Annual Fixed Rent Rate, in equal installments at the Monthly Fixed Rent Rate (which is 1/12th of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate), in advance, without notice or demand, and without setoff, abatement, suspension, deferment, reduction or deduction, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, on the first day of each calendar month included in the term; and for any portion of a calendar month following the Initial Premises Rent Commencement Date, at the rate for the first Lease Year payable in advance for such portion. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements, that the Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord shall continue to be payable in all events and that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the requirement to pay or perform the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express provision of this Lease.
4.1
                                
The Fixed Rent.
 
If Landlord shall give notice to Tenant that all rent and/or other payments due hereunder are to be made to Landlord by check, or by any other commercially reasonable means, Tenant shall make all such payments as shall be due after receipt of said notice by means as designated by Landlord, with such payments to be made to such address and to such person or entity as is specified by Landlord.
 
The Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease are sometimes referred to herein as "Rent."
 
  Tenant covenants and agrees to pay, as Additional Rent, insurance costs, utility charges, personal property taxes and its pro rata share of increases in taxes and operating costs with respect to the
4.2
                                
Additional Rent.
Premises and the Property as provided in this Section 4.2 as follows:
 
  If Taxes (as hereinafter defined) for any Tax Year during the Term shall exceed Base Taxes, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional rent, for Tenant's Percentage of such excess (such amount hereinafter referred to as "Tax Excess").  Tenant shall remit to Landlord, on the first day of each calendar month, estimated payments on account of Tax Excess, such monthly amounts to be sufficient to provide Landlord, by the time real estate tax payments are due and payable to any governmental authority responsible for collection of same, a sum equal to the Tax Excess, as reasonably estimated by Landlord from time to time on the basis of the most recent tax data available.  If the total of such monthly remittances for any Tax Year is greater than the actual Tax Excess for such Tax year, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the actual Tax Excess for such Tax Year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days after a written notice to Tenant, which notice shall set forth the manner of computation of Tax Excess).  The Base Taxes shall be reasonably extrapolated to reflect full assessment of the Building by the Town of Burlington, using the tax valuation of the building at 55 Network Drive as a model.
4.2.1
                       
Real Estate Taxes.
 
If, after Tenant shall have made reimbursement to Landlord pursuant to this subsection 4.2.1, Landlord shall receive a refund of any portion of Taxes paid by Tenant with respect to any Tax Year during the term hereof as a result of an abatement of such Taxes by legal proceedings, settlement or otherwise (without either party having any obligation to undertake any such proceedings), Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the Tenant's Percentage of the refund (less the proportional, pro rata expenses, including attorneys' fees and appraisers' fees, incurred in connection with obtaining any such refund), as relates to the Tax Excess paid by Tenant to Landlord with respect to any Tax Year for which such refund is obtained.  At the request of Tenant, from time to time but in no event more than three (3) times during the Original Term, Landlord shall file applications seeking abatements or reductions of Taxes or shall institute proceedings to reduce the assessed valuation of the Property or portions thereof including the Premises with the applicable tax commission or in a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial review of such assessed valuation.  Landlord shall diligently, timely and fully prosecute all such applications and/or proceedings filed or instituted by Landlord.
 
In the event this Lease shall commence, or shall end (by reason of expiration of the term or earlier termination pursuant to the provisions hereof), on any date other than the first or last day of the Tax Year, or should the Tax Year or period of assessment of real estate taxes be changed or be more or less than one (1) year, as the case may be, then the amount of Tax Excess which may be payable by Tenant as provided in this subsection 4.2.1 shall be appropriately apportioned and adjusted.
 
The term "Taxes" shall mean all taxes, assessments, betterments and other charges and impositions (including, but not limited to, fire protection service fees and similar charges) levied or assessed, or which may be equitably attributable to the Property, for or in respect of the Property, at any time during the term by any governmental authority, or taxes in lieu thereof, and additional types of taxes to supplement real estate taxes due to legal limits imposed thereon.  If, at any time during the term of this Lease, any tax or excise on rents or other taxes, however described, are levied or assessed against Landlord with respect to the rent reserved hereunder, either wholly or partially in substitution for, or in addition to, real estate taxes assessed or levied on the Property, such tax or excise on rents shall be included in Taxes.  Taxes shall include any estimated payment made by Landlord on account of a fiscal tax period for which the actual and final amount of taxes for such period has not been determined by the governmental authority as of the date of any such estimated payment.  The following shall be from Taxes and shall be paid solely by Landlord: inheritance, estate, succession, transfer, gift, franchise, or capital stock tax, or any income taxes arising out of or related to ownership and operation of income-producing real estate, or any excise taxes imposed upon Landlord based upon gross or net rentals or other income received by it, any increase in taxes and assessments resulting solely from Landlord's sale of, or other transfer of its interest in, the Building, and assessments, charges, taxes, rents, rates, levies, excises, license fees, permit fees, inspection fees, or other authorization fees or charges to the extent allocable to or caused by the development or installation of off-Premises improvements or utilities (including without limitation street and intersection improvements, roads, rights of way, lighting, and signalization) necessary for any past, present or future system development reimbursement schedule or sinking fund related to any of the foregoing, except to the extent any of the foregoing may be properly allocable to and charged against the Premises pursuant to another provision of this Lease.
excluded
 
Currently, the Building and the adjacent building known as 55 Network Drive are located on land which is identified as a single tax parcel included in one tax bill from the Town of Burlington.  Until such time that separate tax parcels are defined and assessed by the Town to include a separately identified tax parcel including the Building and the Premises, Taxes hereunder shall include the Tenant's Percentage of the portion of such Taxes allocated by the Town of Burlington to the Building.
 
  Tenant shall pay all taxes charged, assessed or imposed upon the
4.2.2
                       
Personal Property Taxes.
personal property of Tenant in or upon the Premises.
 
  If, during the Term hereof, Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined) incurred by Landlord in any calendar year shall exceed Base Operating Costs, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional rent, for Tenant's Percentage of any such excess (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Operating Costs Excess").  Tenant shall remit to Landlord, on the first day of each calendar month, estimated payments on account of Operating Costs Excess, such monthly amounts to be sufficient to provide Landlord, by the end of the calendar year, a sum equal to the Operating Costs Excess, as reasonably estimated by Landlord from time to time.  If, at the expiration of the year in respect of which monthly installments of Operating Costs Excess shall have been made as aforesaid, the total of such monthly remittances is greater than the actual Operating Costs Excess for such year, Landlord shall within 30 days after such determination pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the Operating Costs Excess for such year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days from the date Landlord shall furnish to Tenant an itemized statement of the Operating Costs Excess, prepared, allocated and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
4.2.3
                       
Operating Costs.
 
Landlord shall keep, in the Building Manager's office, complete books and records regarding Operating Costs and Taxes.  Tenant and its representatives, at Tenant's sole expense, shall have the right, during customary business hours, to inspect at Landlord's offices, Landlord's books and records relating to Operating Costs for the immediately preceding calendar year.  As a condition to performing any such inspection, Tenant and its examiners shall be required to execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, agreeing to keep confidential any information which Tenant and the examining party discover about the Building in connection with such examination, except for disclosures required by law, court order or regulatory authorities, or to Tenant's attorneys, accountants, auditors, or potential purchasers of the Tenant company.  If Tenant elects to exercise such right, it must provide reasonable prior written notice to Landlord given no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Statement of Operating Costs for any calendar year and it must complete any such inspection within 60 days of commencement.  Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant to enable Tenant to complete its inspection within the time period specified in the preceding sentence.  If Landlord is obligated to reimburse Tenant for cost of the audit as provided below, Tenant shall give Landlord a complete copy of the results of its inspection.  If it is determined that Tenant is entitled to a refund, then such refund shall either be in cash or applied as a credit to the next due installment of Rent, at the election of Landlord.  If it is determined Tenant has underpaid, then Tenant shall pay such amount within thirty (30) days of Landlord's invoice therefor.  Tenant agrees to use for such inspection a firm that is reasonably acceptable to Landlord and that is not being paid on a contingency fee basis. If Operating Costs were overstated by more than three percent (3%), then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the reasonable cost of the audit.
 
Any reimbursement for Operating Costs due and payable by Tenant with respect to periods of less than twelve (12) months shall be equitably prorated.
 
The term "Operating Costs" shall mean all costs and expenses incurred for the operation, cleaning, maintenance, repair and upkeep of the Property, and the portion of such costs and expenses with regard to the Campus Common Areas which is equitably allocable to the Property, including, without limitation, all costs of maintaining and repairing the Property and the Park (including snow removal, landscaping and grounds maintenance, operation and maintenance of parking lots, sidewalks, walking paths, access roads and driveways, Building exterior and service areas, security, operation and repair of heating and air-conditioning equipment, elevators, lighting and any other Building equipment or systems) and of all repairs and replacements (other than repairs or replacements for which Landlord has received full reimbursement from contractors, other tenants of the Building or from others) necessary to keep the Property and the Park in good working order, repair, appearance and condition; all payments under any cross easement agreement, declaration of restrictive covenants and like instruments pertaining to the sharing of costs by the Building and other buildings in the Park; all costs, including material and equipment costs, for cleaning and janitorial services to the Building (including window cleaning of the Building); all costs of any reasonable insurance carried by Landlord relating to the Property; all costs related to provision of heat (including electric, and/or gas), chilled water for air-conditioning, and water (including sewer charges) and other utilities to the Premises, if not sub-metered, and to the Building Common Areas and the Property (exclusive of amounts reimbursable to Landlord as a result of direct billing to any tenant of the Building and excluding charges for electricity for lights and plugs to unleased or vacant tenant space in the Building); payments under all service contracts relating to the foregoing; all compensation, fringe benefits, payroll taxes and workmen's compensation insurance premiums related thereto with respect to any employees of Landlord or its affiliates engaged in security and maintenance of the Property and the Park; costs of maintaining and operating any amenities available for the general use of all tenants now or hereafter located in the Campus Common Areas including an on-site cafeteria (including a monthly cafeteria subsidy, if any); attorneys fees and disbursement in connection with tax abatement proceedings, auditing and other professional fees and expenses; and a management fee in line with local market rates for similar Class  A buildings (during the Original Term, 3% of the gross collected Rents).  In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, through Operating Costs, 100% of all
charges for electricity and chilled water furnished by the Building systems to the Connector Bridge, as measured by sub-meter or reasonably estimated by Landlord.
 
The following items shall be excluded in Landlord's calculation of Operating Costs:
 
leasing commissions, fees and costs, advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred in procuring tenants or in selling the Building or the Park;

 Lease Year to replace worn-out items as may be necessary to maintain the Building in good working order, repair, appearance and in first-class condition, and not to enhance the Building over and above its current appearance and condition, (the items in clauses (a), (b) and (c) are collectively called "capital expenditures"), the total amount of which is not properly included in Operating Costs for the calendar year in which they were made, there shall nevertheless be included in Operating Costs for each calendar year in which and after such capital expenditure is made the annual charge-off of such capital expenditure.  The annual charge-off shall be determined by (i)  dividing the original cost of the capital expenditure by the number of years of useful life thereof as reasonably determined by Landlord; and (ii)  adding to such quotient an interest factor computed on the unamortized balance of such capital expenditure based upon an interest rate reasonably determined by Landlord as being the interest rate then being charged for long-term mortgages by institutional lenders on like properties within the locality in which the Building is located.  Except for the annual charge-off described above, no portion of any capital expenditures shall be included within Operating Costs.  Landlord covenants that it will not grant to any future tenant of the Park (to the extent Landlord, or its affiliates, control other buildings in the Park) rights regarding capital expenditures that are more favorable in such regard than this provision is for Tenant.
If, during the Term of this Lease (except as provided for in clause (c) below), Landlord shall replace any capital items or make any capital expenditures which (a) are intended to reduce Operating Costs or (b) are required to comply with laws enacted after the date of this Lease or (c) are required after the expiration of the 1
st
 
If during any portion of any year for which Operating Costs are being computed, the Building was not fully occupied by tenants or if not all of such tenants were paying fixed rent or if Landlord was not supplying all tenants with the services, amenities or benefits being supplied hereunder, the categories of Operating Costs which vary with occupancy shall be reasonably extrapolated by Landlord to the estimated Operating Costs that would have been incurred if the Building were fully occupied by tenants and all such tenants were then paying fixed rent or if such services were being supplied to all tenants, and such extrapolated amount shall, for the purposes of this Section 4.2.3, be deemed to be the Operating Costs for such year.  Similarly, if during calendar year 2010, the Building was not fully occupied, then Base Operating Costs shall be comparably "grossed up" to reflect the Operating Costs that would have been incurred had the Building been fully occupied.
 
  Tenant shall, at its expense, as Additional Rent, take out and maintain throughout the term the following insurance protecting Landlord:
4.2.4
                       
Insurance.
 
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord through Operating Costs, pursuant to Section 4.2.3, for all charges for gas and chilled water for normal office heating and air-conditioning, and water for ordinary cleaning and lavatory use during the Term.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord by means of monthly escrow payments (as hereinafter set forth) for all charges for the cost of electricity for Tenant's lights, outlets and VAV boxes, and for usage of electricity and chilled water for Tenant's special requirements at the Premises. Commencing as of the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, estimated charges (the "Utilities Charges") on account of Tenant's consumption of electricity in the Premises for its lights, outlets, and VAV boxes, and for usage of electricity and chilled water consumption for Tenant's special requirements at the Premises.  Landlord shall reasonably estimate the amount of Utilities Charges payable by Tenant per month and shall notify Tenant prior to the Commencement Date of the initial estimate of Utilities Charges to be paid by Tenant.  Tenant shall pay the Utilities Charges on the first day of each calendar month included in the Term, in the same manner as Tenant pays Fixed Rent pursuant to Section 4.1 above. Following Landlord's receipt of utility provider invoices, Landlord will reconcile the estimated Utilities Charges paid by Tenant with the actual amounts owing from Tenant based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity used in the Premises for the preceding month as registered on the sub-meters for the Premises, based on the excess chilled water consumption as registered on the BTU meters for the areas of excess use.  If it is determined Tenant has been overcharged, then such overpayment will be refunded to Tenant within thirty (30) days after such determination or credited against Tenant's account for the following month.  If Tenant has underpaid, then Landlord will invoice Tenant for the amount owed and Tenant shall pay such amount within thirty (30) days after billing. Landlord reserves the right to adjust the monthly Utilities Charges from time to time based on the most current data available for Tenant's electrical and chilled water consumption in the Premises, and Tenant shall thereafter pay the adjusted Utilities Charges to Landlord until further notice.  Additionally, Tenant shall pay all charges for telephone and other utilities or services not supplied by Landlord, whether designated as a charge, tax, assessment, fee or otherwise, all such charges to be paid as the same from time to time become due.  Except as otherwise provided in Article 5, it is understood and agreed that Tenant shall make its own arrangements for the installation or provision of all such utilities and that Landlord shall be under no obligation to furnish any utilities to the Premises and shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any such utilities to the Premises.
4.2.5
                       
Utilities.
  If any installment of Fixed Rent is paid five (5) or more days after notice that the same is overdue, and if on a prior occasion in the twelve (12) month period prior to the date such installment was due an installment of rent was paid after the same was due, then Tenant shall pay Landlord a late payment fee equal to five (5%) percent of the current overdue payment.
4.3
                                
Late Payment of Rent.
 
The performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall be secured by a letter of credit throughout the term hereof in accordance with and subject to the following terms and conditions:
4.4
                                
Letter of Credit.
 
  Concurrently with Tenant's execution and delivery of this Lease,  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the "Original Letter of Credit") which shall be (i) in the form of Exhibit H attached to this Lease (the "Form LC"), (ii) issued by a commercial bank reasonably satisfactory to Landlord upon which presentment may be made in Boston, Massachusetts, (iii) in the amount equal to the Letter of Credit Amount, and (iv) for a term of at least 1 year, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4.2 below.  The Original Letter of Credit, any Additional Letters(s) of Credit and Substitute Letter(s) of Credit are referred to herein as the "Letter of Credit."
4.4.1
                       
Amount of Letter of Credit.
 
  Each Letter of Credit shall be automatically renewable in accordance with the second to last paragraph of the Form LC; provided however, that Tenant shall be required to deliver to Landlord a new letter of credit (a "Substitute Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit under Section 4.4.1 on or before the date 30 days prior to the expiration of the term of the Letter of Credit then in effect, if the issuer of such Letter of Credit gives notice of its election not to renew such Letter of Credit for any additional period pursuant thereto.  Should any Letter of Credit contain a final expiration date, in addition to a current expiration date, such final expiration date shall be no earlier than 45 days following the Expiration Date of this Lease.  If Tenant does not deliver a Substitute Letter of Credit 30 days prior to the expiration of the current Letter of Credit, Landlord shall be permitted to draw down the entire Letter of Credit Amount and hold the cash as "Security Proceeds" pursuant to Section 4.4.6 below.
4.4.2
                       
Renewal of Letter of Credit.
 
  If the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum payable to Landlord hereunder shall be overdue and unpaid or should Landlord make payments on behalf of the Tenant, or Tenant shall fail to perform any of the terms of this Lease in all cases beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit the amount necessary to cure such default. In the event of any such draw by the Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an additional Letter of Credit ("Additional Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit, except that the amount of such Additional Letter of Credit shall be the amount of such draw, or (b) a substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Original Letter of Credit).
4.4.3
                       
Draws to Cure Defaults.
 
  In addition, if (i) this Lease shall have been terminated as a result of Tenant's default under this Lease beyond the expiration of the applicable cure period, and/or (ii) this Lease shall have been rejected in a bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding, then Landlord shall have the right at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit an amount sufficient to pay any and all damages payable by Tenant on account of such termination or rejection, as the case may be, pursuant to Article 8 hereof. In the event of bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding against Tenant, all proceeds of the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.
4.4.4
                       
Draws to Pay Damages.
 
  In the event the issuer of any Letter of Credit becomes insolvent or is placed into receivership or conservatorship by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any successor or similar entity, or if a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for the issuer, then, effective as of the date of such occurrence, the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to not meet the requirements of this Section 4.4 and Tenant shall, within five (5) business days of written notice from Landlord, deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit which otherwise meets the requirements of this Section, or, alternatively, Tenant shall, within such five (5) business-day period deliver cash to Landlord in the Letter of Credit Amount, which Landlord shall hold as "Security Proceeds", governed by the provisions of Section 4.4.6 below.
4.4.5
                       
Issuing Bank.
 
  If Tenant fails timely to deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter, without giving any notice to Tenant, to draw down the Letter of Credit and to hold the proceeds thereof ("Security Proceeds") in a bank account in the name of Landlord, which may be withdrawn and applied by Landlord under the same circumstances and for the same purposes as if the Security Proceeds were a Letter of Credit. Upon any such application of Security Proceeds by Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an Additional Letter of Credit in the amount of Security Proceeds so applied, or (b) a Substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Security Proceeds).
4.4.6
                       
Draws for Failure to Deliver Substitute Letter of Credit.
 
Landlord shall be entitled to transfer its beneficial interest under the Letter of Credit or any Security Proceeds in connection with (i) Landlord's sale or transfer of the Building, or (ii) the addition, deletion or modification of any beneficiaries under the Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit shall specifically state on its face that it is transferable by Landlord, its successors and assigns.  Landlord shall be responsible for all costs and fees charged to effect such transfer.
4.4.7
                       
Transferability.
 
Within 45 days after the expiration of the term, to the
4.4.8
                       
Return of Letter of Credit at End of Term.
extent Landlord has not previously drawn upon any Letter of Credit or Security Proceeds held by Landlord, Landlord shall return the same to Tenant, less so much thereof that Landlord reasonably estimates is necessary to compensate Landlord toward the curing of any continuing default of any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, specifically including any restoration obligations under Section 6.1.9.
 
On the condition that (a) Tenant is not in default at the time of the applicable reduction, (b) has not been in default of its monetary obligations under this Lease more than two times during the Term, (c) Tenant has had a net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year of Tenant prior to the applicable reduction (the "Profitability Test"), as shown on Tenant's Consolidated Statement of Operations in its most recent audited annual report, and (d) to the extent Tenant is no longer a public company, Tenant provides Landlord with an audited statement reporting satisfaction of the Profitability Test, then the Letter of Credit Amount shall be reduced as follows:
4.4.9
                       
Reduction in Letter of Credit Amount.
 
at the end of the 2 Lease Year, by $170,477.00;
(i)
                                    
nd
 
at the end of the 3rd Lease Year, by $170,477.00; and
(ii)
                                 
 
at the end of the 5th Lease Year, by $170,477.00.
(iii)
                              
 
If Tenant fails to qualify for any reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount due solely to Tenant's inability to satisfy the Profitability Test as of the date of the applicable reduction, Tenant shall nevertheless be permitted to effect a reduction of $170,477.00 at any time after the stated reduction date once Tenant satisfies the Profitability Test and delivers proof thereof to Landlord, provided that Tenant otherwise satisfies the remaining conditions listed above in this Section 4.4.9.  Any reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount for which Tenant qualifies after the applicable reduction date shall not diminish or postpone any subsequent reduction.  Except as provided above, there shall be no reductions in the Letter of Credit Amount, it being understood that at no time shall the Letter of Credit Amount be less than $511,431.00.  Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for taking all necessary steps to effect a reduction, provided however that Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant to amend the Letter of Credit or obtain a Substitute Letter of Credit, as applicable, at no cost to Landlord.
 
ARTICLE 5
Landlord's Covenants
  Landlord covenants with Tenant:
5.1
                                
Affirmative Covenants.
 
  To furnish to the Premises heat and air-conditioning (reserving the right, at any time, to change energy or heat sources) sufficient to maintain the Premises at comfortable temperatures (subject to all federal, state, and local regulations relating to the provision of heat), during the hours of 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays and 7:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays ("Normal Business Hours"), excluding all legal holidays on which the Building is normally closed.  All charges for gas and chilled water furnished to the Premises for normal office heating and normal office air-conditioning will be included in Operating Costs pursuant to Section 4.2.3 and paid for by Tenant pursuant to said Section 4.2.3.  Heat and air-conditioning will be available to Tenant after Normal Business Hours by prior request of Landlord's managing agent at least 24 hours in advance.  As of the date of this Lease, Landlord estimates the after-hours charge for heating or cooling an entire wing is $80.00 per wing per hour based on current utility costs.  The after-hours cost is allocated per wing not per floor, and shall be based upon utility costs to Landlord, taking into account wear and tear on equipment. The rate of increase in the after-hours charges shall not exceed the rate of increase in the utility costs to Landlord.  If Tenant shall use chilled water after Normal Business Hours and if such after-hours use shall result in an additional cost to Landlord on account thereof, Tenant shall, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for the actual utility costs plus any additional costs as reasonably estimated by Landlord (such as wear and tear on the equipment).  If Tenant shall use chilled water in excess of reasonable quantities for normal office air-conditioning, then Landlord reserves the right to install a separate meter or sub-meter, at Tenant's expense, to measure the flow of chilled water to the Premises, if deemed necessary by Landlord, and Tenant shall pay Utilities Charges for the excess chilled water pursuant to Section 4.2.5 above.  The phrase "normal office air-conditioning" wherever used in this Lease means cooling at 1 CFM per square foot averaged over the square footage of the Premises with 55 discharge air and 75 thermostat set points.  In addition, Tenant shall be able to utilize up to 200 tons of process cooling capacity for its labs in Wing B on the 1 Floor, which will be separately sub-metered and paid for by Tenant pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.2.5.

st
 
  To furnish to the Premises, separately sub-metered and paid for by Tenant directly to Landlord, as provided in Section 4.2.5 above, electricity for Tenant's lights, outlets and VAV boxes.  Landlord will provide Tenant with 1,300 KVA of electricity for normal office use from the house system for the Building, and any electrical needs of Tenant above the foregoing capacity will be satisfied by Tenant's electrical service upgrade work, pursuant to Section 3.5 of this Lease.  If at any time after such initial electrical upgrade work, (i) in Landlord's reasonable judgment, Landlord's facilities are inadequate for such excess requirements, or (ii) such excess use shall result in an additional burden on the Building utilities systems and additional cost to Landlord on account thereof, as the case may be, (a)  Tenant shall, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for such
5.1.2
                       
Electricity.
additional cost, as aforesaid, or (b)  Landlord, upon written request, and at the sole cost and expense of Tenant, will furnish and install such additional wire, conduits, feeders, switchboards and appurtenances and other electrical system upgrades as reasonably may be required to supply such additional requirements of Tenant (if electricity therefor is then available to Landlord), provided that the same shall be permitted by applicable laws and insurance regulations and shall not cause permanent damage or injury to the Building or cause or create a dangerous or hazardous condition or entail excessive or unreasonable alterations or repairs. Tenant shall be entitled to use at least the Tenant's Percentage of the Building's available conduit and chase space.
 
.  The Building is equipped with a 1,400 kw (1,750 KVA) standby generator (the "Building Generator").  As of the Date of this Lease, the Building Generator has available capacity for non-exclusive use by tenants of the Building.  Tenant shall be permitted to use up to 725 KVA of the available capacity for Tenant's "special needs" areas.  If Tenant requires additional generator capacity above what is stated in this Section 5.1.2.1, Tenant will be required to make its own arrangements to accommodate Tenant's needs.  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the life safety loads shall remain priority one in the Building Generator.
5.1.2.1
              
Building Generator
 
  To provide cleaning to the Premises in accordance with cleaning and janitorial standards generally prevailing throughout the term hereof in comparable office buildings within the municipality in which the Building is located, but at least to the standards outlined in Exhibit K ; and to furnish water to the Premises for ordinary cleaning, lavatory and toilet facilities.
5.1.3
                       
Cleaning; Water.
 
 To furnish elevator service (if any) from the lobby to the Premises; and to maintain fire alarm systems within the Building.
5.1.4
                       
Elevator; Fire Alarm.
 
  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to make such repairs and replacements to the roof, exterior walls, floor slabs and other structural components of the Building, and to the common areas, facilities and plumbing, electrical, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems of the Building and Park as may be necessary to keep them in good repair and condition (exclusive of equipment installed by Tenant and except for those repairs required to be made by Tenant pursuant to Section 6.1.3 hereof and repairs or replacements occasioned by any act or negligence of Tenant, its servants, agents, customers, contractors, employees, invitees, or licensees).
5.1.5
                       
Repairs.
 
  Landlord shall be under no responsibility or liability for failure or interruption of any of the above-described services, repairs or replacements caused by breakage, accident, strikes, repairs, inability to obtain supplies, labor or materials, or for any other causes beyond the control of the Landlord, and in no event for any indirect or consequential damages to Tenant; and failure or omission on the part of the Landlord to furnish any of same for any of the reasons set forth in this paragraph shall not be construed as an eviction of Tenant, actual or constructive, nor entitle Tenant to an abatement of rent (except with respect to an "Abatement Event" as provided below), nor render the Landlord liable in damages, nor release Tenant from prompt fulfillment of any of its covenants under this Lease.
5.2
                                
Interruption.
 
An "Abatement Event" shall be defined as an event or circumstance (other than those addressed in Article 7) that reasonably prevents Tenant from using the entire Premises, or any material portion thereof, or the parking areas of the Property, as a result of Landlord's failure to provide any service required to be provided by Landlord under this Lease that is essential for Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Premises, or to provide reasonable access to the Premises, provided that such failure or Landlord's inability to remedy such event or circumstance is not due to a cause beyond Landlord's reasonable control generally affecting other buildings in the vicinity of the Premises (such as a neighborhood power outage).  Tenant shall give Landlord notice (an "Abatement Notice") of any such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement Event continues beyond the "Eligibility Period" (as that term is defined below), then the Monthly Fixed Rent and monthly charges on account of Operating Costs Excess and Tax Excess shall be abated entirely or proportionately, as the case may be, after the expiration of the Eligibility Period for such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable area of the Premises.  Tenant shall not be entitled to an abatement of Rent if Tenant is then in default of its monetary obligations beyond the expiration of all notice and cure periods under this Lease.  The term "Eligibility Period" shall mean a period of five (5) consecutive business days after Landlord's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s).
 
With Landlord's prior reasonable approval, Tenant may, at its sole cost and expense, contract for outside services for the Premises over and above those services to be provided by Landlord as set forth herein, including security services, which Landlord acknowledges may involve the installation of cameras, monitory devices and alarms, (which installation shall be subject to the requirements of Section 6.2.5 below).  Tenant may also elect to perform certain of the Landlord-provided services (such as cleaning) utilizing outside vendors. If Landlord approves the installation and/or utilization of such services, such installation and utilization shall be at Tenant's sole cost, risk and expense, in which event all costs relating to the provision of such services shall be excluded from "Operating Costs".
5.3
                                
Outside Services.

Access.
 
  During the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall cause to be operated a full-service caf with catering service for use by all tenants.  Landlord shall construct or provide, at its sole expense, and maintain throughout the Term an unstaffed fitness center in the Park for general availability to all tenants, with no user or membership fees charged to Tenant and its employees.  The fitness center will contain men's and women's locker rooms with shower facilities, cardio equipment, free weights, strength training equipment and stretching areas.  Landlord agrees to complete such fitness center no later than the Commencement Date and operate the same throughout the Term.  Regarding the conference center, Landlord shall assist Tenant in arranging for access to a shared conference facility, which is currently leased to Sun.  Sun has indicated to Landlord that it will work with other tenants of the Park to provide reasonable access to such conference facility, at Sun's discretion.  Landlord agrees to continue to operate a caf and catering service and fitness center of substantially comparable quality, general size and services throughout the Term.  Within 60 days following the date of this Lease, Landlord will provide Tenant with general rules and guidelines relating to the use of the Park amenities center and the Sun conference facility.
5.5
                                
Building Amenities.
 
Landlord represents to Tenant to Landlord's actual knowledge that, except as may be disclosed in that certain Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment Report prepared by Sleeman Hanley & DiNitto dated June 15, 2007 (the "Phase 1 Report"), there are no hazardous materials in, on, about, under or emanating from the Premises or the Park in violation of any laws.  Landlord shall indemnify and defend, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant, and hold Tenant harmless from and against, any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, claims, fees, penalties,  and fines incurred by Tenant as a result of the existence prior to and on the Date of this Lease of hazardous materials, or oil  in, on or about the Premises or the Park; provided, however, that with respect to claims against Tenant by employees or former employees of Tenant relating to such pre-existing hazardous materials or oil, Landlord shall have no duty to defend Tenant, and Landlord's obligation to indemnify Tenant in such cases shall apply only if such employee's claim prevails, despite Tenant having used reasonable efforts to defend such claim, in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction through final judgment, with no further appeal.  Landlord shall not be responsible for any claims for consequential damages or lost profits of Tenant.  Tenant hereby acknowledges receipt of the Phase 1 Report.
5.6
                                
Environmental.
 
Landlord shall maintain in full force throughout the Term, a policy of insurance upon the Building insuring against all risks of physical loss or damage under a "special" coverage form in an amount at least equal to the full replacement value of the Building, with an Agreed Amount endorsement, as well as insurance against breakdown of boilers and other machinery as customarily insured against.
5.7
                                
Insurance.
 
Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant as of the date hereof that (a) Landlord holds fee simple title to the Property, subject to no mortgage other than a mortgage to Bank of America and related participants; (b) Landlord has full power and authority to enter into this Lease; (c) no other party has any possessory right to the Premises or has claimed the same; and (d) Landlord has not received notice within the 12-month period preceding the Date of this Lease of any noncompliance with any land use laws or environmental laws relating to the Building that would adversely affect Tenant's ability to use the Premises (specifically excluded are any notifications relating to any pre-existing condition described in the Phase 1 Report).
5.8
                                
Representations.
 
Landlord shall save harmless, exonerate and indemnify Tenant, its agents and employees (such agents and employees being referred to collectively as the "Tenant Related Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities or penalties asserted by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or public authority on account of injury, death, damage or loss to person or property occurring outside the Premises but within the Building (excluding the Connector Bridge) or on the Campus Common Areas arising out of the negligence, fault or misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's failure to perform and observe the obligations expressly assumed under the provisions of this Lease, except if the same was caused by the negligence, fault or misconduct of Tenant or the Tenant Related Parties.  In respect of all of the foregoing, Landlord shall indemnify Tenant and the Tenant Related Parties from and against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and liabilities incurred in or in connection with any such claim, action or proceeding brought thereon; and, in case of any action or proceeding brought against Tenant or the Tenant Related Parties by reason of any such claim, Landlord, upon notice from Tenant and at Landlord's expense, shall resist or defend such action or proceeding and employ counsel therefor reasonably satisfactory to Tenant provided that Tenant shall be deemed to have approved counsel provided by Landlord's liability insurer.

Prohibited Occupants
 
 
It is understood that Landlord has imposed the foregoing prohibition for the benefit of Sun, and Tenant acknowledges that Sun is a third party beneficiary of the foregoing restriction and use prohibition.  If Tenant allows of the Premises to be used or occupied by any of the Prohibited Occupants in violation of this provision, Landlord may take any and all action necessary to cause such use or occupancy to cease.  During the Term of this Lease, if Sun seeks to reduce the premises under the Sun Lease, Landlord agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain an agreement by Sun to eliminate the foregoing described use restriction.
 
   To maintain the Premises in neat order and condition and to perform all routine and ordinary repairs to the Premises and to any plumbing, heating, electrical, ventilating and air-conditioning systems or other specialty systems located within or outside of the Premises and installed by Tenant such as are necessary to keep them in good working order, appearance and condition, as the case may require, reasonable use and wear thereof and damage by fire or by unavoidable casualty only excepted; to keep all glass in windows and doors of the Premises (except glass in the exterior walls of the Building) whole and in good condition with glass of the same quality as that injured or broken; and to make as and when needed as a result of misuse by, or neglect or improper conduct of Tenant or Tenant's servants, employees, agents, invitees or licensees or otherwise, all repairs necessary, which repairs and replacements shall be in quality and class equal to the original work. Additionally, Tenant shall maintain the Cooling Plant and keep it in good condition and repair throughout the Term.  (Landlord, upon default of Tenant beyond the expiration of the applicable notice and cure periods hereunder [except in emergencies where immediate action may be taken],  may elect, at the expense of Tenant, and upon three (3) business days' prior written notice or fewer if reasonable under the circumstances, to perform all such cleaning and maintenance and to make any such repairs or to repair any damage or injury to the Building or the Premises caused by moving property of Tenant in or out of the Building, or by installation or removal of furniture or other property, or by misuse by, or neglect, or improper conduct of, Tenant or Tenant's servants, employees, agents, contractors, customers, patrons, invitees, or licensees.)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant shall not be responsible for compliance with any such laws, regulations, or the like requiring (a) structural repairs or modifications; or (b) repairs or modifications to the utility or building service equipment; or (c) installation of new building service equipment, such as fire detection or suppression equipment, unless such repairs, modifications, or installations shall be due to Tenant's particular manner of use of the Premises (as opposed to office use generally) or required on account of any work done by or on behalf of Tenant.
6.1.4
                       
Compliance with Law.
 
   To save harmless, exonerate and indemnify Landlord, its agents (including, without limitation, Landlord's managing agent) and employees (such agents and employees being referred to collectively as the "Landlord Related Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities or penalties asserted by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or public authority on account of injury, death, damage or loss to person or property in or upon the Premises (including the Connector Bridge) and the Property or on the Campus Common Areas arising out of the use or occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or by any person claiming by, through or under Tenant (including, without limitation, all patrons, employees and customers of Tenant), or arising out of any delivery to or service supplied to the Premises, or on account of or based upon anything whatsoever done on the Premises, except if the same was caused by the willful negligence, fault or misconduct of Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties.  In respect of all of the foregoing, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties from and against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and liabilities incurred in or in connection with any such
6.1.5

claim, action or proceeding brought thereon; and, in case of any action or proceeding brought against Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties by reason of any such claim, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord and at Tenant's expense, shall resist or defend such action or proceeding and employ counsel therefor reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.  The preceding indemnification shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
 
   To permit Landlord and its agents to enter into and examine the Premises at reasonable times, and upon reasonable prior notice when practical, and to show the Premises, and to make repairs to the Premises, and, during the last six (6) months prior to the expiration of this Lease, to keep affixed in suitable places notices of availability of the Premises. Landlord's entry shall be subject to Tenant's reasonable security rules, including the requirement that Landlord be accompanied by a Tenant representative (except in emergency circumstances).
6.1.6
                       
Landlord's Right to Enter.
 
   All of the furnishings, fixtures, equipment, effects and property of every kind, nature and description of Tenant and of all persons claiming by, through or under Tenant which, during the continuance of this Lease or any occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant, may be on the Premises, shall be at the sole risk and hazard of Tenant and if the whole or any part thereof shall be destroyed or damaged by fire, water or otherwise, or by the leakage or bursting of water pipes, steam pipes, or other pipes, by theft or from any other cause, no part of said loss or damage is to be charged to or to be borne by Landlord, except that Landlord shall in no event be indemnified or held harmless or exonerated from any liability to Tenant or to any other person, for any injury, loss, damage or liability to the extent prohibited by law.
6.1.7
                       
Personal Property at Tenant's Risk.
 
  To pay on demand Landlord's expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in enforcing any obligation of Tenant under this Lease or in curing any default by Tenant under this Lease as provided in Section 8.4.
6.1.8
                       
Payment of Landlord's Cost of Enforcement.
 
   At the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease:  to surrender all keys to the Premises; to remove all of its trade fixtures and personal property in the Premises; to deliver to Landlord stamped architectural plans showing the Premises at yield up (which may be the Final Plans  if Tenant has made no installations after the Commencement Date); to remove all wiring and cabling; to remove all rooftop equipment, and such installations and alterations made by it, including the TIW, as Landlord had designated for removal at the time of Landlord's approval of such installations or alterations (as set forth below) and all Tenant's signs wherever located; to repair all damage caused by such removal and restore any damaged areas to normal office finishes standard for the Building; and to yield up the Premises, including all installations and improvements made by Tenant (which shall be intact and in good working order, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted), except for Tenant's trade fixtures and such of said installations or improvements as Landlord shall have requested Tenant to remove at the time of plan approval as set forth below.  Landlord reserves the right to require removal of any alterations for which plans were not required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.2.5 of this Lease, if Tenant had failed to so request Landlord's designation for removal of such alterations as set forth in  Section 6.2.5.  Tenant shall surrender the Premises broom-clean and in the condition the same were in on the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted. Tenant, at the time of requesting Landlord's approval of any installations or alterations in the Premises, including the TIW and Tenant's Work Change Orders (whether or not plans are required for the installation) shall request in writing that Landlord designate which such installations or alterations must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  After receipt of Tenant's request, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing which such installations or alterations must be removed from the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord does not indicate that a particular installation must be removed, then Landlord shall not later have the right to request its removal.  Likewise, if Tenant, when making any installations or alterations, fails to so request in writing whether Landlord will require removal of such installation or alteration, then Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to remove the installation or alteration at the end of the Term. With respect to the TIW, Tenant need not make a formal written request; however, Landlord shall, as part of its approval of the Schematic Design Plans provide a preliminary summary of which items, if any, it requires be removed.  Landlord will provide Tenant with a progress summary of items designated for removal as soon as practical following receipt of the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, taking into consideration that the resulting Final Plans may necessitate amendment of Landlord's summary of items that require end of term removal.  In any event, Landlord agrees to be reasonable in determining whether any installation or alteration must be removed and agrees to limit its removal requirements to those installations or alterations that Landlord deems specialized for Tenant's use and not typical for normal office tenant use (such as specialty process electrical systems, chillers, generators, nitrogen tanks, by way of example, but not finishes and architectural elements included in the TIW).  Any property required to be removed that is not so removed shall be deemed abandoned and, if Landlord so elects, deemed to be Landlord's property, and may be retained or removed and disposed of by Landlord in such manner as Landlord shall determine and Tenant shall pay Landlord the entire cost and expense incurred by it in effecting such removal and disposition and in making any incidental repairs and replacements to the Premises.  Tenant shall further indemnify Landlord against all loss, cost and damage resulting from Tenant's failure and delay in surrendering the Premises as above provided; however, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages if Tenant occupies the Premises for fewer than
6.1.9
                       
Yield Up.
thirty (30) days beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  Except as specifically provided for in this Section 6.1.9, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages for breach of any provision of this Lease.
 
If the Tenant remains in the Premises beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, such holding over shall be without right and shall not be deemed to create any tenancy, but the Tenant shall be a tenant at sufferance only at a daily rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent in effect under this Lease as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease, for the first thirty (30) days of such holding over, and thereafter at a daily rate of two (2) times the Rent in effect as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease.
 
  To comply with the Rules and Regulations set forth in Exhibit E, and with all reasonable Rules and Regulations of general applicability to all tenants of the Building and the Park hereafter made by Landlord, and of which Tenant has been given notice, concerning, among other things, the use of the cafeteria and fitness center and conference center. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for the failure of other tenants to conform to such Rules and Regulations, of which Tenant has been given notice. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to enforce the Rules and Regulations and shall apply the same in a non-discriminatory manner.
6.1.10
                 
Rules and Regulations.
 
   Upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written request by Landlord, to execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing, which may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F or in another form reasonably similar thereto, or such other commercially reasonable form as Landlord may provide from time to time, certifying all or any of the following to the extent true:  (i) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, (ii) whether the term has commenced and Fixed Rent and Additional Rent have become payable hereunder and, if so, the dates to which they have been paid, (iii) whether or not Landlord is in default in performance of any of the terms of this Lease, (iv) whether Tenant has accepted possession of the Premises, (v) whether Tenant has made any claim against Landlord under this Lease and, if so, the nature thereof and the dollar amount, if any, of such claim, (vi) whether there exist any offsets or defenses against enforcement of any of the terms of this Lease upon the part of Tenant to be performed, and (vii) such further information with respect to the Lease or the Premises as Landlord may reasonably request.  Any such statement delivered pursuant to this subsection 6.1.11 may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Premises, or any prospective assignee of such mortgage.  Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord such financial information as may be reasonably required by Landlord to be provided to any mortgagee or prospective purchaser of the Premises.  The requirement of the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.
6.1.11
                 
Estoppel Certificate.
 
  To reimburse Landlord promptly on demand for all reasonable legal expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with all requests by Tenant for consent or approval hereunder.
6.1.12
                 
Landlord's Expenses Re Consents.
 
Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord that the person signing below has full power and authority to bind Tenant and that Tenant has the authority to enter into this Lease and has obtained all consents and approvals and has taken all actions necessary in connection therewith.
6.1.13
                 
Representation
 
   Tenant covenants at all times during the term and such further time (prior or subsequent thereto) as Tenant occupies the Premises or any part thereof:
6.2
                                
Negative Covenants.
 
  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, not to assign, transfer, mortgage or pledge this Lease or to sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions and licenses and the like) all or any part of the Premises or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate hereby created or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned, transferred or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, or permit the occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord.  In the event Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublet any portion or all of the Premises (whether to a Successor or Affiliate or to a third party), Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of Tenant's intent to so assign this Lease or sublet the Premises and the proposed effective date of such subletting or assignment, and in the case of a transfer to a third party, shall request in such notification that Landlord consent thereto.  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, Landlord may terminate this Lease in the case of a proposed assignment or any proposed sublet of all or any portion of the Premises for the remainder of the Term; and, in the case of any proposed subletting that results in more than 30% of Tenant's space in the Premises and in the Building 75 Premises, in the aggregate, being sublet space, whether via one sublease or multiple subleases, (but in no event resulting in more than 50% of the Premises being sublet) Landlord may recapture that space proposed for subletting and terminate this Lease in part with respect to the entire sublet space or the newly proposed sublet space, as applicable. If Landlord exercises its recapture right, it shall do so by giving written notice of termination to Tenant within ten (10) days after Tenant's request for consent and Landlord's receipt of all relevant information reasonably required by Landlord, with such termination to be effective as of the effective date of such assignment or subletting.  Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration
6.2.1
                       
Assignment and Subletting.
of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed a waiver of its recapture right.  If Landlord does not so terminate or is deemed to have waived its right to terminate, Landlord's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld to an assignment or to a subletting, provided that the following conditions are met:
 
the assignee or subtenant shall use the Premises only for the Permitted Uses;
(i)
                                    
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant has a net worth and, in the case of an assignee, creditworthiness, reasonably sufficient to enable it to perform the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, or the sublease, as applicable;
(ii)
                                 
 
the amount of the aggregate rent to be paid by the proposed subtenant is not less than eighty (80%) percent of the then current market rate for the Premises; and
(iii)
                              
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant is not then a tenant in the Building or the Park, or an entity with which Landlord is dealing or has dealt within the preceding six months regarding the possibility of leasing space in the Building or the Park, and Landlord actually has available reasonably comparable space in the Park;
(iv)
                             
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant is not a Prohibited Occupant as defined under subsection 6.1.2.1.
(v)
                                
 
Tenant shall furnish Landlord with any information reasonably requested by Landlord to enable Landlord to determine whether the proposed assignment or subletting complies with the foregoing requirements, including without limitation, financial statements relating to the proposed assignee or subtenant.  Tenant's rights under Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 6.2.5.1 are personal to the initial named Tenant and may not be assigned except (a) in connection with an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor, and (b) in connection with an assignment of this Lease and the Building 75 Lease, together and in their entirety, to a single assignee.
 
Tenant shall, as Additional Rent, reimburse Landlord promptly for Landlord's reasonable legal expenses incurred in connection with any request by Tenant for such consent.  If Landlord consents thereto, no such subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder, and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation to obtain the Landlord's written approval in the case of any other subletting or assignment.
 
If for any assignment or sublease consented to by Landlord hereunder Tenant receives rent or other consideration, either initially or over the term of the assignment or sublease, in excess of the rent called for hereunder, or in case of sublease of part, in excess of such rent fairly allocable to the part. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent fifty (50%) percent of the excess of each such payment of rent or other consideration received by Tenant promptly after its receipt.  In calculating any excess rent payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this provision, Tenant shall first be entitled to deduct (a) the gross Fixed Rent and Additional Rent paid to Landlord by Tenant with respect to the subject portion of the Premises during the period commencing on the date Tenant vacates the subject portion of the Premises until the date the assignee or sublessee is obligated to pay rent pursuant to its assignment or sublease; (b) improvement allowances or other economic concessions granted by Tenant to the assignee or sublessee; (c) the unamortized costs of initial and subsequent improvements to the sublet portion of the Premises paid for by Tenant and amortized over the sublease term; (d) costs incurred by Tenant to buy out or take over the previous lease of the assignee or sublessee; (e) all costs incurred by Tenant to advertise the subject portion of the Premises for assignment or sublease; (f) brokerage commissions and legal fees paid by Tenant in connection with the assignment or sublease; and (g) all other costs reasonably incurred by Tenant.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, the preceding provisions of this Section 6.2.1 shall not apply to a sublet of all or any portion of the Premises or an assignment of this Lease to either (i) an entity which is controlled by, is under common control with, or which controls Tenant (any of the foregoing, an "Affiliate") or (ii) an entity into or with which Tenant is merged or consolidated or which acquires all or substantially all of Tenant's stock or assets (any of the foregoing, a "Successor"), provided that in the case of an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor (1) such Affiliate or Successor, as the case may be, agrees directly with Landlord, by written instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, to assume and perform all the obligations of Tenant; (2) Tenant continues to remain primarily liable under this Lease; and (3) Tenant notifies Landlord of the merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, stock or membership interests at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such transfer (except where the transaction must for legal and reasonable business purposes remain confidential, in which event such proof of net worth shall be delivered promptly after consummation of the transaction).  The transaction for which consent from the Landlord is not required pursuant to this paragraph shall be referred to as a "Permitted Transfer."
If at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a name change, reformation or reorganization of the Tenant entity, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord documenting such name change, reformation or reorganization.  If, at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a transfer of a controlling interest in the stock, membership or general partnership interests of Tenant, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and (whether or not Tenant so notifies Landlord) such a transfer will be deemed an assignment subject to the provisions of this Section 6.2.1. The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not be applicable as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.
 
  Not to injure, deface or otherwise harm the Premises; nor commit any nuisance; nor permit in the Premises any vending machine (except such as is used for the sale of merchandise to employees of Tenant) or inflammable fluids or chemicals (except such as are customarily used in connection with standard office equipment); nor permit any cooking to such extent as requires special exhaust venting; nor permit the emission of any objectionable noise or odor; nor make, allow or suffer any waste; nor make any use of the Premises which is improper, offensive or contrary to any law or ordinance or which will invalidate any of Landlord's insurance; nor conduct any auction, fire, "going out of business" or bankruptcy sales.
6.2.2
                       
Nuisance.
 
  Except for customary office and cleaning supplies (which shall be handled in compliance with all applicable laws), not to dispose of any hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil on the Premises or the Property, or into any of the plumbing, sewage, or drainage systems thereon, and to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from all claims, liability, loss or damage arising on account of the use or disposal of hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil, including, without limitation, liability under any federal, state, or local laws, requirements and regulations, or damage to any of the aforesaid systems.  Tenant shall comply with all governmental reporting requirements with respect to hazardous wastes, hazardous materials and oil, and shall deliver to Landlord copies of all reports filed with governmental authorities. The preceding indemnification shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
6.2.3
                       
Hazardous Wastes and Materials.
 
  Not to place a load upon any floor of the Premises exceeding the floor load per square foot area which such floor was designed to carry and which is allowed by law.  Landlord reserves the right to prescribe the weight and position of all heavy business machines and equipment, including safes, which shall be placed so as to distribute the weight.  Business machines and mechanical equipment which cause vibration or noise shall be placed and maintained by Tenant at Tenant's expense in settings sufficient to absorb and prevent vibration, noise and annoyance.  Tenant shall not move any safe, heavy machinery, heavy equipment, freight or fixtures into or out of the Premises except in such manner and at such time as Landlord shall in each instance authorize.

Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent and approval within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant, without the prior consent of Landlord, may make nonstructural, interior alterations or installations at a cost not to exceed $1.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises per alteration/installation project (and then only up to $3.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises in any 12-month period), only if such alterations or installations do not adversely affect the structural integrity of the Building, impact the Building systems, involve penetration of the roof or exterior walls. In addition, Tenant may, without Landlord's prior consent, paint and carpet interior areas of the Premises that are not visible from outside the Premises.  In any instance where Tenant is permitted to make an installation or alteration without Landlord's prior consent, then Tenant shall, at the time of making such installation or alteration, request in writing if such installation or alteration must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord so designates such installation or alteration for removal, then Tenant shall remove the same in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1.9 above.  If Tenant fails to make such request, then Landlord shall have the option to require Tenant to remove such installation or alteration at the end of the Term.

the limits set forth in Section 1.1 and to submit certificates evidencing such coverage to Landlord prior to the commencement of such work.  Tenant shall pay promptly when due the entire cost of any work to the Premises undertaken by Tenant so that the Premises shall at all times be free of liens for labor and materials, and at Landlord's request (which shall be made reasonably in light of the scope and cost of the proposed work, among other factors) Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a bond or other security acceptable to Landlord assuring that any work commenced by Tenant will be completed in accordance with the plans and specifications theretofore approved by Landlord and assuring that the Premises will remain free of any mechanics' lien or other encumbrance arising out of such work.  In any event, Tenant shall, within ten days after the institution of such liens or encumbrances, bond against or discharge any mechanics' liens or other encumbrances that may arise out of such work.  Tenant shall procure all necessary licenses and permits at Tenant's sole expense before undertaking such work.  All such work shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner employing materials of good quality and so as to conform with all applicable zoning, building, fire, health and other codes, regulations, ordinances and laws.  Tenant shall save Landlord harmless and indemnified from all injury, loss, claims or damage to any person or property occasioned by or growing out of such work.

The installation, operation, maintenance and removal of any rooftop equipment shall be Tenant's responsibility, at its sole cost and expense and shall be performed in accordance with the terms of the Lease (including but not limited to Section 6.2.5) and all applicable laws and requirements of applicable governmental authorities.  Landlord shall not charge Tenant for the right to use the roof to install the rooftop equipment.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any liability, claims, damage or loss arising from the installation, maintenance, repair replacement and operation of any rooftop equipment, unless caused by Landlord, its agents, employees or contractors.  Tenant shall have the right to use its pro rata share of available shaft space, if any, in the Building as reasonably necessary to connect the Premises to the rooftop equipment.  Tenant shall have access to the roof upon reasonable notice to Landlord  for the purpose of installing, operating, maintaining, repairing, or removing the rooftop equipment.   Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove all rooftop equipment from the roof and repair any damage to the roof caused thereby.  The right to install the rooftop equipment is personal to the initial named Tenant and may not be used by, or assigned or otherwise transferred to, any other party, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2.1.

For so long as Tenant is the largest or second largest tenant in the Building (determined by the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises, from time to time) Tenant shall have the right to install an identification sign on the exterior faade of the Building,the size and location of which must first be approved by Landlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and be in compliance with the Network Drive Sign Policy (the receipt of which Tenant hereby acknowledges).  All signage is subject to and must comply with applicable building codes and zoning ordinances of the Town of Burlington.  Tenant shall be solely responsible for all costs of installing, maintaining and removing its exterior sign.

ARTICLE 7
Casualty or Taking
 In the event that the Premises or the Building, or any material part thereof, (a) shall  be taken by any public authority or for any public use, or (b) shall be Substantially Damaged (as hereinafter defined) by fire or casualty, or by the action of any public authority, or (c) the net proceeds of insurance recovered or damages awarded is insufficient to pay for the cost of restoration work, then this Lease may be

Termination.
terminated at the election of Landlord.  The term "Substantially Damaged" as used herein shall mean damage so extensive that thirty-five (35%) percent or more of the Rentable Floor Area of the Building is destroyed.  Such election, which may be made notwithstanding the fact that Landlord's entire interest may have been divested, shall be made by the giving of notice by Landlord to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the date of the taking or casualty.  If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, it shall also terminate the leases of all other similarly situated tenants of the Building.  In the event that the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or casualty, or if there is a taking of a material part of the Premises or Building, and in either case, in the reasonable opinion of an independent architect or engineer selected by Landlord, cannot be repaired or restored within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the date of such event, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Landlord or Tenant, which election shall be made by the giving of notice to the other party within thirty (30) days after the date the opinion of the architect or engineer is made available to the parties.  If any taking affecting the parking area serving the Building reduces the number of parking spaces afforded Tenant pursuant to Section 2.1, by more than twenty-five (25%) percent, and if Landlord does not provide Tenant with permanent substitute parking elsewhere in the Park within ninety (90) days of the taking, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Tenant by written notice to Landlord within twenty (20) days after at the expiration of such 90-day period.  In addition, with respect to a taking or casualty occurring during the last twelve (12) months of the Term (if Tenant has declined to exercise any remaining Extension Option) which causes the Premises or the Building, or any material part thereof, to be damaged to the extent that 30% or more of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises or the Building is destroyed, then either Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease, which election shall be made within twenty (20) days after the taking or casualty and effective as of the date that is 45 days after the date of a party's written notice of its election.
 
  If neither Landlord nor Tenant elects to so terminate, this Lease shall continue in force and a just proportion of the rent reserved, according to the nature and extent of the damages sustained by the Premises, shall be suspended or abated until the Premises, or what may remain thereof, shall be put by Landlord in proper condition for use (which shall at least be the same as immediately prior to the taking or casualty), which Landlord covenants to do with reasonable diligence to the extent permitted by the net proceeds of insurance recovered, or recoverable if Landlord carried the coverage required to be carried hereunder, or damages awarded for such taking, destruction or damage and subject to zoning and building laws or ordinances then in existence.  "Net proceeds of insurance recovered or damages awarded" refers to the gross amount of such insurance or damages less the reasonable expenses of Landlord incurred in connection with the collection of the same, including without limitation, fees and expenses for legal and appraisal services.
7.2
                                
Restoration.
 
  Irrespective of the form in which recovery may be had by law, all rights to damages or compensation shall belong to Landlord in all cases, except for awards made for Tenant's moving expenses and equipment and trade fixtures.  Except for such awards, Tenant hereby grants to Landlord all of Tenant's rights to such damages and covenants to deliver such further assignments thereof as Landlord may from time to time request.

ARTICLE 8
Defaults
  (a)  If Tenant shall default in the performance of any of its obligations to pay the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum due Landlord hereunder and if such default shall continue for ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord designating such default or if within thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant specifying any other default or defaults Tenant has not commenced diligently to correct the default or defaults so specified or has not thereafter diligently pursued such correction to completion, or (b)  if any assignment shall be made by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for the benefit of creditors, or (c)  if Tenant's leasehold interest shall be taken on execution, or (d)  if a lien or other involuntary encumbrance is filed against Tenant's leasehold interest or Tenant's other property, including said leasehold interest, and is not discharged within  fifteen (15) days thereafter, or (e)  if a petition is filed by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for liquidation, or for reorganization or an arrangement under any provision of any bankruptcy law or code as then in force and effect, or (f)  if an involuntary petition under any of the provisions of any bankruptcy law or code is filed against Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant and such involuntary petition is not dismissed within  ninety (90) days thereafter, then, and in any of such cases, Landlord and the agents and servants of Landlord lawfully may, in addition to and not in derogation of any remedies for any preceding breach of covenant, immediately or at any time thereafter without demand or notice and with or without process of law (forcibly, if necessary) enter into and upon the Premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole or mail a notice of termination addressed to Tenant, and repossess the same as of landlord's former estate and expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant and remove its and their effects (forcibly, if necessary) without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies which might otherwise be used for arrears of rent or prior breach of covenants, and upon such entry or mailing as aforesaid this Lease shall terminate, Tenant hereby waiving all statutory rights to the Premises (including without limitation rights of redemption, if any, to the extent such rights may be lawfully waived) and Landlord, without notice to Tenant, may store Tenant's effects, and those of any person claiming through or under Tenant, at the expense and risk of Tenant, and, if Landlord so elects, may sell such effects at public auction or private sale and apply the net proceeds to the payment of all sums due to Landlord from Tenant, if any, and pay over the balance, if any, to Tenant.
8.1
                                
Events of Default.
 
 In the event that this Lease is terminated under any of the provisions contained in Section 8.1 or shall be otherwise terminated for breach of any obligation of Tenant, Tenant covenants to pay punctually to
8.2
                                
Remedies.
Landlord all the sums and to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated.  In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the next preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with any amount paid to Landlord as compensation as in this Section 8.2 provided and also with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises, after deducting all Landlord's expense in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord may (i)  relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same and (ii)  make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same, and no action of Landlord in accordance with the foregoing or failure to relet or to collect rent under reletting shall operate or be construed to release or reduce Tenant's liability as aforesaid.
 
In lieu of full recovery by Landlord of the sums payable under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 (except for the amount of any rent of any kind accrued and unpaid at the time of termination) Landlord may by written notice to Tenant, elect to recover, and Tenant shall thereupon pay forthwith to Landlord, as compensation, the discounted present value (calculated using a discount factor equal to the then "Prime Rate" as is used by the Bank of America or its successor) of the excess of the total rent reserved for the residue of the term over the rental value of the Premises for said residue of the term.  In calculating the rent reserved there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value of all other considerations agreed to be paid or performed by Tenant for said residue.
 
Nothing contained in this Lease shall, however, limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove for and obtain in proceedings for bankruptcy or insolvency by reason of the termination of this Lease, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.
 
  Any and all rights and remedies which Landlord may have under this Lease, and at law and equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at the same time insofar as permitted by law.
8.3
                                
Remedies Cumulative.
 
 Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure, at any time, without notice, any default by Tenant under this Lease; and whenever Landlord so elects, all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in curing a default shall be paid, as Additional Rent, by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with lawful interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord to the date of payment by Tenant.
8.4
                                
Landlord's Right to Cure Defaults.
 
  Any consent or permission by Landlord to any act or omission which otherwise would be a breach of any covenant or condition herein, shall not in any way be held or construed (unless expressly so declared) to operate so as to impair the continuing obligation of any covenant or condition herein, or otherwise, except as to the specific instance, operate to permit similar acts or omissions.
8.5
                                
Effect of Waivers of Default.
 
 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation.  The receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord.  No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.
8.6
                                
No Waiver, etc.
 
  No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or charge due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent or other charge be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.
8.7
                                
No Accord and Satisfaction.
ARTICLE 9
Rights of Mortgage Holders
  The word "mortgage" as used herein includes mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments evidencing other voluntary liens or encumbrances, and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof.  The word "holder" shall mean a mortgagee, and any subsequent holder or holders of a mortgage.  Until the holder of a mortgage shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have only such rights of Landlord as are necessary to preserve the integrity of this Lease as security.  Upon entry and taking possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have all the rights of Landlord. 
9.1
                                
Rights of Mortgage Holders.
No such holder of a mortgage shall be liable either as mortgagee or as assignee, to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure.  Upon entry for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall be liable to perform all of the obligations of Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the provisions of Section 10.4, provided that a discontinuance of any foreclosure proceeding shall be deemed a conveyance under said provisions to the owner of the equity of the Property.
 
The covenants and agreements contained in this Lease with respect to the rights, powers and benefits of a holder of a mortgage (particularly, without limitation thereby, the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 9.1) constitute a continuing offer to any person, corporation or other entity, which by accepting a mortgage subject to this Lease, assumes the obligations herein set forth with respect to such holder; such holder is hereby constituted a party of this Lease as an obligee hereunder to the same extent as though its name were written hereon as such; and such holder shall be entitled to enforce such provisions in its own name.  Tenant agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time any agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 9.1.
 
  A. It is agreed that the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease shall be (i)  subject or subordinate to any present or future mortgage or mortgages and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest of the holder thereof in the Premises or any property of which the Premises are a part if Landlord shall elect by notice to Tenant to subject or subordinate the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease to such mortgage or (ii)  prior to any present or future mortgage or mortgages, if Landlord shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to give the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease priority to such mortgage; in the event of either of such elections and upon notification by Landlord to that effect, the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease should be deemed to be subordinate to, or have priority over, as the case may be, said mortgage or mortgages, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any such mortgage or mortgages (provided that, in the case of subordination of this Lease to any future mortgages, the holder thereof agrees to recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease and not to disturb the possession of Tenant. Tenant agrees it will, upon not less than fifteen (15) days' prior written request by Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all reasonably acceptable instruments deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable to give effect to or notice of such subordination or priority.  Tenant agrees that any future SNDA that is similar in all materially respects to the form of SNDA attached as Exhibit M will be deemed "reasonably acceptable".  Any Mortgage to which this Lease shall be subordinated may contain such terms, provisions and conditions as the holder deems usual or customary.
9.2
                                
Lease Superior or Subordinate to Mortgages.
 
Landlord agrees to use diligent efforts to cause its current mortgagee to deliver to Tenant  a "subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement" in the form attached to this Lease as Exhibit M (the "SNDA"), no later than 5 business days after full execution of this Lease.  It is agreed that it shall be an express condition precedent to the validity of this Lease that Landlord's current mortgagee provides such an SNDA to Tenant, and if such SNDA is not provided to Tenant by the aforesaid date, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord no later than 10 business days after the full execution of this Lease, effective upon the giving of such notice.

Quiet Enjoyment.

Exhibit G
 
  The term "Landlord" as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations to be performed by Landlord are concerned, shall be limited to mean and include only the

Limitation of Landlord's Liability.
owner or owners at the time in question of the Property, and in the event of any transfer or transfers of title to said property, the Landlord (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then grantor) shall be concurrently freed and relieved from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance, without any further instrument or agreement of all liability as respects the performance of any covenants or obligations on the part of the Landlord contained in this Lease thereafter to be performed, it being intended hereby that the covenants and obligations contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord, shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on the Landlord, its successors and assigns, only during and in respect of their respective successive periods of ownership of said leasehold interest or fee, as the case may be.  Tenant, its successors and assigns, shall not assert nor seek to enforce any claim for breach of this Lease against any of Landlord's assets other than Landlord's interest in the Property and in the rents, issues and proceeds thereof, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such interest for the satisfaction of any liability or claim against Landlord under this Lease, it being specifically agreed that in no event whatsoever shall Landlord (which term shall include, without limitation, any general or limited partner, trustees, beneficiaries, officers, directors, or stockholders of Landlord) ever be personally liable for any such liability.
 
  In any case where either party hereto is required to do any act, delays caused by or resulting from Acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire, flood or other casualty, labor difficulties, shortages of labor, materials or equipment, government regulations, unusually severe weather, or other causes beyond such party's reasonable control (any of the foregoing causes being referred to herein as "Force Majeure") shall not be counted in determining the time during which work shall be completed, whether such time be designated by a fixed date, a fixed time or a "reasonable time," and such time shall be deemed to be extended by the period of such delay.  No event shall constitute "Force Majeure" unless the party invoking the benefit of this Section 10.5 advises the other party of the occurrence of the alleged Force Majeure event within 5 business days after such party's awareness of the occurrence of such event.
10.5
                          
Force Majeure.
 
A.  Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder unless it shall fail to perform such obligations and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default after written notice has been given by Tenant to Landlord (with copies of such notice delivered simultaneously to all mortgagees of which Tenant has notice) specifying the nature of Landlord's alleged default.  Landlord shall not be liable in any event for incidental or consequential damages to Tenant by reason of Landlord's default, whether or not notice is given.  Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any default by Landlord hereunder and no right, for any such default, to offset or counterclaim against any rent due hereunder, except as expressly provided below.
10.6
                          
Landlord's Default.
 
B.  If Landlord fails, after the expiration of the cure periods specified in Paragraph (A) above, to cure any default, Tenant may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Landlord captioned "NOTICE  SELF-HELP REMEDY TO BE INVOKED" advising Landlord that Tenant intends to exercise its self-help rights under this Section 10.6, undertake to cure any default by Landlord under this Lease relating to the Premises and/or building systems exclusively serving the Premises, provided however, that Tenant shall not have the right to cure any such default to the extent that such cure would relate to (i) areas outside of the Premises, (ii) the structure or mechanical or life safety systems of the Building or (iii) any systems serving any portion of the Building other than the Premises.  Whenever Tenant so elects to cure a default by Landlord as set forth herein, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's written demand (which shall include reasonably detailed supporting documentation), reimburse Tenant for all costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in curing a default; provided, however, Landlord shall only be responsible for the incremental cost in excess of the cost that would ordinarily be part of Operating Costs under this Lease, if applicable.  If Landlord fails to make any payment to Tenant as and when due, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity, Tenant shall have the right to offset such owed amounts against its payments of Fixed Rent coming due under this Lease; provided, however, that the amount of each such monthly offset shall not exceed twenty (20%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated under Section 1.1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord has undertaken curative action (which may include providing Tenant with a remedial plan and timetable for rectifying the default) and is proceeding with diligence, but has been unable to fully complete such cure by the expiration of thirty (30) days from Tenant's first notice of such default, Landlord shall be afforded a reasonable time thereafter in which to complete its curative efforts before Tenant may effect a cure.  If Tenant elects to exercise self-help under this Section 10.6, then Tenant may not avail itself of any other remedy at law or in equity.
 
 Each of Landlord and Tenant warrants and represents that it has dealt with no broker in connection with the consummation of this Lease, other than the Brokers, and each agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless form and against any and all loss, cost, damage, claim or expense resulting from the breach of the foregoing warranty.  Landlord shall pay the Brokers pursuant to a separate agreement.  Tenant shall have no liability for any amounts due the Brokers.

Brokerage.
 
  This Lease may be executed in counterpart copies, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, if any provisions of this Lease shall to any extent be invalid, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.  This Lease and the Exhibits attached hereto and forming a part hereof constitute all the covenants, promises, agreements, and understandings between Landlord and Tenant concerning the Premises and the Building and there are no covenants, promises, agreements or understandings, either oral or written, between them other than as are set forth in this Lease.  Neither Landlord nor Landlord's agents shall be bound to any representations with respect to the Premises, the Building or the Property except as herein expressly set forth, and all representations, either oral or written, shall be deemed to be merged into this Lease. Each of Landlord and Tenant shall and does hereby waive

E.
                                     
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and other valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and with the understanding by Tenant that Lenders shall rely hereon in maintaining the Loan, Agent, Landlord, and Tenant agree as follows:
 
Subordination.  The Lease and the rights of Tenant thereunder are subordinate and inferior to the Mortgage and the Assignment and any amendment, renewal, substitution, extension or replacement thereof and each advance made thereunder, and to Agent's right to enforce the Mortgage and the lien and security interest granted therein, as though the Mortgage and the Assignment, and each such amendment, renewal, substitution, extension or replacement were executed and recorded, and the advance made, before the execution of the Lease, all on the terms and conditions herein provided.
1.
                                      
 
Non-Disturbance and Recognition.  So long as Tenant is not in default (beyond any period expressed in the Lease within which Tenant may cure such default) in the payment of rent, (i) Tenant's occupancy of the Premises shall not be disturbed by Agent in the exercise of any of its rights under the Mortgage during the term of the Lease, or any extension or renewal thereof made in accordance with the terms of the Lease; provided, however, Agent will have all the rights and remedies of the Landlord upon any default by Tenant under the Lease, (ii) Agent will not join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or proceeding for the purpose of terminating Tenant's interest and estate under the Lease because of any default under the Mortgage, and (iii) upon succeeding to the interest of Borrower as Landlord under the Lease, except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement, Agent and Lenders shall recognize all of Tenant's rights under the Lease, including, without limitation, all rights of rent offset set forth in the Lease and all rights under that certain Construction Escrow Agreement dated as of November   , 2009 by and between Landlord, Tenant and Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, as escrow agent; provided, however, Agent's obligations under the Lease and under the Construction Escrow Agreement shall be limited to obligations related to TIW (as such term is defined in the Lease) and, in connection therewith, Agent's obligations are further limited to the amount allocated to, and available under, the Loan for TIW for the Premises that has not already been advanced.  Tenant and Borrower confirm and agree, upon succeeding to the interest of Borrower as Landlord under the Lease, Agent's obligations under the Lease and under the Construction Escrow Agreement specifically exclude any obligations relating to the Base Building Work, the Connector Bridge and any other Landlord's Work (as such terms are defined under the Lease).  Agent acknowledges that Tenant has self-help rights under the Lease relating to Landlord's Work and the Connector Bridge, as described in Section 6 hereof; the right to draw funds for completion of Landlord's Work and the Connector Bridge pursuant to the Construction Escrow Agreement; and a right of offset against rent under Section 3.10(C) of the Lease with respect to certain costs of completing the Connector Bridge; and Agent agrees that none of the foregoing shall impair Tenant in any manner in the exercise of those rights.
2.
                                      
 
Attornment and Certificates.  In the event Agent succeeds to the interest of Borrower as Landlord under the Lease, or if the Property or the Premises are sold pursuant to any foreclosure of the Mortgage, Tenant shall attorn to Agent, or a purchaser upon any such foreclosure sale, and shall recognize Agent, or such purchaser, thereafter as the Landlord under the Lease.  Such attornment shall be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instrument.   Tenant agrees, however, to execute and deliver at any time and from time to time, upon the request of any holder(s) of any of the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the Mortgage, or upon request of any such purchaser, (a) any instrument or certificate which, in the reasonable judgment of such holder(s), or such purchaser, may be necessary or appropriate in any such foreclosure proceeding or otherwise to evidence such attornment, and (b) an instrument or certificate regarding the status of the Lease, consisting of statements, if true (and if not true, specifying in what respect), (i) that the Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) the date through which rentals have been paid, (iii) the duration and date of the commencement of the term of the Lease, (iv) the nature of any amendments or modifications to the Lease, (v) that no default, or state of facts, which with the passage of time, or notice, or both, would constitute a default, exists on the part of either party to the Lease, and (vi) the dates on which payments of additional rent, if any, are due under the Lease.
3.
                                      
 
Limitations.  If Agent exercises any of its rights under the Assignment or the Mortgage, or if Agent shall succeed to the interest of Landlord under the Lease in any manner, or if any purchaser acquires the Property, or the Premises, upon or after any foreclosure of the Mortgage, or any deed in lieu thereof, Agent or such purchaser, as the case may be, shall have the same remedies by entry, action or otherwise in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period expressed in the Lease within which Tenant may cure such default) in the payment of rent or in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be paid, performed or observed that the Landlord had or would have had if Agent or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of the present Landlord.  From and after any such attornment, Agent or such purchaser shall be bound to Tenant under all the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall, from and after such attornment to Agent, or to such purchaser, have the same remedies against Agent, or such purchaser, for the breach of an agreement contained in the Lease that Tenant might have had under the Lease against Landlord, if Agent or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord.  Provided, however, that Agent or such purchaser shall only be bound during the period of its ownership, and that in the case of the exercise by Agent of its rights under the Mortgage, or the Assignment, or any combination thereof, or a foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, Agent's liability under the Lease shall be limited to, and all Tenant claims shall be satisfied only out of, the interest, if any, of Agent, or such purchaser, in the Property, and Agent and such purchaser shall not be (a) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including the Landlord); or (b) liable for or incur any obligation with
4.
                                      
 
respect to the construction of the Property or any improvements of the Premises or the Property; or (c) liable for or subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against any prior landlord (including the Landlord), except and only to the extent such offset or defense does not relate to monetary damages accruing as a result of any acts or omissions occurring before the period of Agent's, or any such purchaser's, ownership; provided however, that this limitation does not limit Tenant's exercise of its rights to offset or defense under law and/or as expressly provided in the Lease; or (d) bound by any rent or additional rent which Tenant might have paid for more than the then current rental period to any prior landlord (including the Landlord); or (e) bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease that is made without Agent's prior written consent; or (f) bound by any assignment of the Lease or any encumbrance of Tenant's interest thereunder or any sublet thereunder (except if expressly permitted without Landlord's consent under the terms of the Lease) that is made without Agent's prior written consent; or (g) bound by or responsible for any security deposit not actually received by Agent; or (h) liable for or incur any obligation with respect to any breach of warranties or representations of any nature under the Lease or otherwise including without limitation any warranties or representations respecting use, compliance with zoning, landlord's title, landlord's authority, habitability and/or fitness for any purpose, or possession; or (i) liable for consequential damages.  The foregoing shall not, however:  (i) relieve Agent or such purchaser, of the obligation to remedy or cure any conditions at the Premises the existence of which constitutes a Landlord default under the Lease and which continue at the time of such succession or acquisition, provided, however, that Agent shall in no event be liable for actual damages caused by such conditions; or (ii) deprive the Tenant of the right to terminate the Lease for a breach of Landlord covenant which is not cured as provided for herein and in the Lease and as a result of which there is a material interference with Tenant's permitted use and occupation of the Premises or any permitted business conducted therein; or (iii) deprive Tenant of accrued but unapplied rent offset rights, as set forth in the Lease, relating to periods prior to Agent's or purchaser's succession to the interest of Borrower as Landlord.
 
Rights Reserved.  Nothing herein contained is intended, nor shall it be construed, to abridge or adversely affect any right or remedy of:  (a) the Landlord under the Lease, or any subsequent Landlord, against the Tenant in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period expressed in the Lease within which Tenant may cure such default) in the payment of rent or in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed or observed; or (b) the Tenant under the Lease against the original or any prior Landlord in the event of any default by the original Landlord to pursue claims against such original or prior Landlord whether or not such claim is barred against Agent or a subsequent purchaser.
5.
                                      
 
Notice and Right to Cure.  Tenant agrees to provide Agent with a copy of each notice of default given to Landlord under the Lease, at the same time as such notice of default is given to the Landlord, and that in the event of any default by the Landlord under the Lease, Tenant will take no action to terminate the Lease (a) if the default is not curable by Agent (so long as the default does not interfere with Tenant's use and occupation of the Premises), or (b) if the default is curable by Agent, unless the default remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been given, postage prepaid, to Agent at the address provided in Section 7 below; provided, however, that if any such default is such that it reasonably cannot be cured within such thirty (30) day period, such period shall be extended for such additional period of time as shall be reasonably necessary (including, without limitation, a reasonable period of time to obtain possession of the Property and to foreclose the Mortgage), if Agent gives Tenant written notice within such thirty (30) day period of Agent's election to undertake the cure of the default and if curative action (including, without limitation, action to obtain possession and foreclose) is instituted within a reasonable period of time and is thereafter diligently pursued.  Agent shall have no obligation to cure any default under the Lease.  Provided, however, nothing in this Section 6 shall derogate from Tenant's self-help rights as set forth in (i) Sections 3.10(B) and 3.10(C) of the Lease in connection with the Connector Bridge (as such term is defined in the Lease) and (ii) Sections 3.2(A) and 3.2(B) of the Lease in connection with Landlord's Work (as such term is defined in the Lease).
6.
                                      
 
Notices.  Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be given or delivered:  (i) by United States mail, registered or certified, postage fully prepaid, return receipt requested, or (ii) by recognized courier service or recognized overnight delivery service; and in any event addressed to the party for which it is intended at its address set forth below:
7.
                                      
 
 
 
 
or such other address as such party may have previously specified by notice given or delivered in accordance with the foregoing.   Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given and received on the date delivered or tendered for delivery during normal business hours as herein provided.
 
Payment of Rent To Agent.  Tenant acknowledges that it has notice that the Lease and the rent and all sums due thereunder have been assigned to Agent as part of the security for the obligations secured by the Mortgage.  In the event Agent notifies Tenant of a default under the Loan and demands that Tenant pay its rent and all other sums due under the Lease to Agent, Tenant agrees that it will honor such demand and pay its rent and all other sums due under the Lease to Agent, or Agent's designated agent, until otherwise notified in writing by Agent.  Borrower unconditionally authorizes and directs Tenant to make rental payments directly to Agent following receipt of such notice and Borrower further agrees that Tenant may rely upon such notice without any obligation to further inquire as to whether or not any default exists under the Mortgage or the Assignment and notwithstanding any notice from or claim of Borrower to the contrary.  Borrower shall have no right or claim against Tenant for or by reason of any payments of rent or other charges made by Tenant to Agent following Tenant's receipt of any such notice.
8.
                                      
 
No Amendment or Cancellation of Lease.  As long as the Mortgage remains undischarged of record, Tenant shall not agree to amend or modify the Lease in any material respect, or agree to cancel or terminate the Lease or agree to subordinate the Lease to any other mortgage or deed of trust, without Agent's prior written consent in each instance.
9.
                                      
 
No Waiver.  This Agreement does not:
10.
                                
 
constitute a waiver by Agent of any of its rights under the Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Mortgage); or
(a)
                                 
 
in any way release Borrower from its obligations to comply with the terms, provisions, conditions, covenants and agreements and clauses of the Mortgage and other Loan Documents.
(b)
                                
 
Borrower Compliance.  The provisions of the Mortgage remain in full force and effect and must be complied with by Borrower.
11.
                                
 
Captions.  Captions and headings of sections are not part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
12.
                                
 
Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts each of which when executed and delivered is an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
13.
                                
 
Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State where the Property is located.
14.
                                
 
Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Agent and Tenant regarding the subordination of the Lease to the Mortgage and the rights and obligations of Tenant and Agent as to the subject matter of this Agreement.
15.
                                
 
Interaction with Lease and with Mortgage.  If this agreement conflicts with the Lease, then this Agreement shall govern as between the parties, including upon any attornment pursuant to this Agreement.  This Agreement supersedes, and constitutes full compliance with any provisions in the Lease that provide for subordination of the Lease to, or for delivery of nondisturbance agreements by the holder of, the Mortgage.
16.
                                
 
Agent's Rights and Obligations.  Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, Agent shall have no obligations to Tenant with respect to the Lease.
17.
                                
 
Amendments; No Oral Change.  This Agreement may be amended, discharged or terminated, or any of its provisions waived, only by a written instrument executed by the party to be charged.  This Agreement may not be modified orally or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto or their respective successors in interest.
18.
                                
 
Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Agent, Lenders, Tenant and Borrower and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and any purchaser or purchasers at foreclosure of the Property or any portion thereof, and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.

2.1
                                
Premises.
  Landlord hereby leases the Premises to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases the Premises from Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease, and of any agreements, cross easements and restrictions, as the same may be amended from time to time, applicable to the Park, all of which Tenant and Landlord shall observe and perform insofar as the same are applicable to the Property.  Excluded from the Premises are the roof, exterior surfaces of exterior walls, and the pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures of the Building (and any areas such as the space above the ceiling or in the walls, that may contain such pipes, ducts, conduits, wires or appurtenant fixtures).  However, Tenant shall have the right, in common with Landlord, to use the pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures of the Building as reasonably necessary for Tenant's telecommunications cabling and wiring.  Tenant shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, rights to use in common, subject to reasonable rules of general applicability to tenants of the Park, from time to time made by Landlord of which Tenant is given notice:  (a)  the common walkways, roadways, and driveways necessary for access to the Building and the Property, (b)  the common parking areas serving the Building, and (c) all so-called common areas and amenities of the Park serving the Property for the benefit of tenants for access, egress and the like, including the common on-site cafeteria, and including exclusive use of two (2) one (1) inch innnerducts of conduit currently available in the existing campus wide underground communications conduit network owned and controlled by Landlord to run Tenant's fiber cable at Tenant's sole cost and expense;  it being understood that in order to utilize the empty four (4) inch conduit between TMH-11 and the RCN vault tenant will be required to install innerduct in said conduit. Landlord makes no representations regarding future availability of conduit space for Tenant's use but agrees to cooperate with Tenant for Tenant's future needs. The areas and facilities described in clauses (a) through (d) above are referred to as "Building Common Areas."  The areas, facilities and amenities of the Park described to in clause (e) are referred to as "Campus Common Areas."
 
Tenant shall have the exclusive right to use the two loading docks serving the Building.
 
Tenant shall be permitted, on an unreserved first-come first-served basis, to use up to 3.6 spaces per 1000 rentable square feet of the Premises in the parking area serving the Building, or in a parking area reasonably proximate to the Building.  So long as Avid Technology, Inc. is the Tenant under both this Lease and the Building 65 Lease, Landlord will not grant any new tenant of the Building 65 Premises a greater parking ratio than granted to Tenant, or reserved or exclusive parking rights.  If Landlord does grant any other new tenant greater rights than those afforded Tenant under this paragraph, then Landlord shall also grant Tenant similar rights, on a pro rata basis.
 
Landlord reserves the right from time to time, without unreasonable interference with use of the Premises:  (a)  to install, use, maintain, repair, replace and relocate pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, wherever located in the Building, (b) to make any repairs and replacements to the Premises which Landlord may deem necessary, and (c)  in connection with any excavation made upon adjacent land of Landlord or others, to enter, and to license others to enter, upon the Premises to do such work as the person causing such excavation deems necessary to preserve the wall of the Building from injury or damage and to support the same.  In exercising such rights, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize inconvenience to Tenant's operations in the Premises.
 
2.2
                                
Term.
  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for the Original Term, which shall begin on the Commencement Date,  and end on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided.  The term "Substantially Completed" as used herein shall mean that the work to be performed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit C and the Final Plans (defined below) has been completed with the exception of minor items which can be fully completed without material interference with Tenant and other items which because of the season or weather or the nature of the item are not practicable to do at the time, provided that none of said items is necessary to make the Premises tenantable for the Permitted Uses, that the Premises are delivered broom clean, free of prior tenants and occupants and their personal property, and a Certificate of Occupancy (which may be a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, provided that Landlord uses diligence to obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy within a reasonable time) has been issued by the Town of Burlington and all other requirements of "Substantial Completion" set forth in Section 3.1 have been completed. However, if Landlord cannot obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy by the Target Commencement Date because of a Tenant Delay (defined in Section 3.1.B), then the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have occurred and the Landlord's work deemed to be "Substantially Completed" on the date that such work would have been Substantially Completed but for such Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work (defined in Section 3.2 below) and obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy).  When the Commencement Date, the Expiration Date, the Rent Commencement Date, and the beginning and end of the 1
st
 Lease Year have been determined, as well as the notice dates for exercising the Extension Options, such dates shall be evidenced by a document, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and executed by Landlord and Tenant.  If Landlord's Work in the Premises is Substantially Completed prior to completion of the other Avid Spaces, and Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business nonetheless, then the Commencement Date for the Premises under this Lease will be deemed to have occurred as of the date of Tenant's occupancy.  In that event, the first Lease Year under this Lease shall be extended by the number of days necessary to make the last day of such first Lease Year the same as the last day of the first lease year under the Building 65 Lease or the 10 North Lease, whichever lease has a first lease year expiring latest.
The term "Lease Year" as used herein shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive full calendar months.  The first Lease Year shall begin on the Commencement Date if the Commencement Date is the first day of a calendar month; if not, then the first Lease Year shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the Commencement Date occurs.  Each succeeding Lease Year shall commence upon the anniversary date of the first Lease Year.
 
2.2.1
                       
Condition Precedent.
  Reference is made to the fact that Wing B of the Premises is currently leased to and occupied by Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") pursuant to a lease dated June 27, 2007 (the "Sun Lease"), between Landlord and Sun for premises in certain buildings in the Park, including Wing B of the Building.  Pursuant to the terms the Sun Lease, Sun has elected to contract its premises and surrender Wing B effective as of June 30, 2010.  Landlord, the Building 65 Landlord, and the 10 North Landlord and Tenant now desire that Sun accelerate the surrender date to January 31, 2010.  Therefore, it is an express condition precedent to this Lease, the Building 65 Lease and the 10 North Lease that Sun shall agree to an earlier termination and surrender of Wing B of the Building and execute a letter agreement to that effect (the "Sun Letter Agreement"). Landlord shall use diligent efforts to obtain the Sun Letter Agreement as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the Sun Letter Agreement is not executed by Landlord and Sun and a copy delivered to Tenant by the date that is ten (10) days after the full execution of this Lease, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 65 Lease and the 10 North Lease by giving Landlord written notice of termination any time after the expiration of such 10-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement.  If Tenant gives such notice, then this Lease, the Building  65 Lease and the 10 North Lease shall be terminated immediately as of the date of Tenant's notice.   If Tenant has not elected to so terminate the leases, and Landlord, despite having used diligent efforts, has not obtained a fully executed Sun Letter Agreement by the date that is 30 days after full execution of this Lease, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 65 Lease and the 10 North Lease by giving Tenant written notice of termination at any time after the expiration of such 30-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement, such termination to be effective immediately as of the date of the notice. If this Lease and the Building 65 Lease and the 10 North Lease are terminated by either party, no documentation other than a party's notice of termination shall be required to effectuate such termination, and neither party shall have any liability to the other on account of termination.
 
2.3
                                
Extension Option.
A.  Tenant shall have two options (each, an "Extension Option") to extend the term of this Lease, each for an additional period of five (5) years.  The first such fiveyear period (the "First Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, and the second such five-year period (the "Second Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the First Extended Term, provided that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:
 
As of the date of an Extension Notice (defined below) and as of the commencement of the First Extended Term and, if applicable, the Second Extended Term, Tenant has not been in default of its monetary obligations beyond the expiration of any applicable cure periods under this Lease more than two times during the Term, including any Extended Term;
(i)
                                   
 
Tenant simultaneously exercises an extension option under the Building 65 Lease; and
(ii)
                                
 
Tenant has not subleased 20% or more of the sum total of (a) the rentable square footage of the Premises plus (b) the rentable square footage of the premises under the Building 65 Lease , both at the time of the Extension Notice and as of the commencement of the First Extended Term and, if applicable, the Second Extended Term.
(iii)
                             
 
All of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease shall apply to each Extended Term except that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for each such Extended Term shall be the then- fair market rental rate for premises of comparable size and quality to the Premises, in comparable buildings in the competitive market area  as of the commencement of the applicable Extended Term, (the "Fair Market Rate"), excluding the annual charge-off for the bridge connecting the Premises to the Building 65 Premises (the "Connector Bridge"), but in no event less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the term immediately preceding the Extended Term in question.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate during the First Extended Term shall be no less than $28.04 per rentable square foot of Premises (i.e., the average rental rate per rentable square foot of Premises during the Original Term), and during the Second Extended Term, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate shall be no less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the First Extended Term.  In addition, it is expressly understood and agreed that the annual charge-off for the amortized cost of the Connector Bridge pursuant to Section 3.8 of the Building 65 Lease is payable in addition to and apart from the Fixed Rent during the Term and shall not be included in the determination of the Fair Market Rent during any Extended Term. At the time of commencement of an Extended Term, Tenant's Base Operating Costs shall be revised to be Operating Costs for first full calendar year of the Extended Term grossed up if necessary to reflect full occupancy, and Base Taxes shall be revised to be Taxes for the first fiscal year which begins during the first Lease Year of the Extended Term, grossed up if necessary to reflect full assessment.  If Tenant shall elect to exercise an Extension Option, it shall do so by giving Landlord written notice (the "Extension Notice") of its election not later than fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, or fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the First Extended Term, as the case may be.  If Tenant gives such notice and satisfies the conditions specified above, the extension of this Lease shall be automatically effected without the
B.
                                    
execution of any additional documents, but the parties subsequently shall enter into a lease amendment as contemplated under Section 2.3.F below..  The Original Term and each Extended Term are hereinafter collectively sometimes called the "Term" or the "term".
 
Not later than fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term or the First Extended Term, as applicable, Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rate for the applicable Extended Term.  Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord gives Tenant Landlord's proposal for Fair Market Rate, Tenant shall notify Landlord whether Tenant accepts or disputes such rate.  If Tenant disagrees with Landlord's designation, Landlord and Tenant shall commence negotiations to agree upon the Fair Market Rate.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on the Fair Market Rate within thirty (30) days after the date on which Landlord first gave Tenant Landlord's proposal for the Fair Market Rate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be determined as provided below.
C.
                                    
 
If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the Fair Market Rate by the end of said thirty (30)-day period, then within five (5) days thereafter, Landlord and Tenant shall each simultaneously submit to the other in a sealed envelope its good faith estimate of the Fair Market Rate, including anticipated steps in rent, if any.  If the higher of such estimates is not more than one hundred five  percent (105%) of the other estimate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be the average of the two estimates. If the matter is not resolved by the exchange of estimates, then Fair Market Rate shall be determined by an independent arbitrator as set forth below.
D.
                                   
 
Within seven (7) days after the exchange of estimates, the parties shall select, as an arbitrator, a mutually acceptable commercial real estate broker or appraiser licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts specializing in the field of commercial office leasing in the suburban Boston area, having no less than ten (10) years' experience (an "Approved Arbitrator").  If the parties cannot agree on such person, then within a second period of seven (7) days, each shall select one Approved Arbitrator and the two appointed Arbitrators shall, within five (5) days, select a third Approved Arbitrator who shall be the final decision-maker (the "Final Arbitrator").  If one party shall fail to timely make such appointment, then the person chosen by the other party shall be the sole arbitrator. Once the Final Arbitrator has been selected as provided for above, then, as soon thereafter as practicable, but in any case within fourteen (14) days after his or her appointment, the arbitrator shall determine the Fair Market Rate by selecting either the Landlord's estimate of Fair Market Rate or the Tenant's estimate of Fair Market Rate.  Such arbitrator must choose the proposed Fair Market Rate that he/she determines is closest to the actual market rental rate for the Premises, taking into account that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate must in no event be less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the immediately preceding term, as specifically set forth in Section 2.3 (B). There shall be no discovery or similar proceedings. The arbitrator's decision as to which estimate shall be the Fair Market Rate for the Extended Term shall be rendered in writing to both Landlord and Tenant and shall be final and binding upon them and shall be the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for the Extended Term.  The costs of the Final Arbitrator will be equally divided between Landlord and Tenant.  Any fees of any counsel engaged by Landlord or Tenant, however, shall be borne by the party that retained such counsel.
E.
                                     
 
Once the Fair Market Rate has been determined, the parties shall promptly execute an amendment to this Lease setting  forth the Fixed Rent for the Premises during the applicable Extended Term.  For any part of the Extended Term during which the Fixed Rent Rate is in dispute, or has not yet been finally determined, Tenant shall make payments to Landlord on account of Fixed Rent at the rate per square foot of Rentable Floor Area of the Premises last paid under this Lease.  The parties shall adjust for any overpayments or underpayments upon final determination of such rent.

3.1
                                
Base Building Work; Tenant Improvement Work.
  A. Landlord shall cause to be performed, at its expense, the work to demise the common area bathrooms for the Amenities Center, substantially in accordance with the Schematic Design Plans attached hereto as Exhibit C.  In addition, Landlord shall, at its sole cost, install in the Premises check-meters for utilities and chilled water for Tenant's special needs areas, and shall insure that all restrooms and access/egress ways are in compliance with applicable building codes, including those requiring removal of architectural barriers to disabled persons (all of the foregoing is called, the "Base Building Work").  All Landlord's Base Building Work shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner employing building standard materials and finishes.
 
Landlord shall cause to be performed the alterations and improvements desired by Tenant to prepare the Premises for Tenant's use (the "TIW"), substantially in accordance with the Schematic Design Plans attached hereto as Exhibit C and pursuant to the Final Plans.  The TIW will be performed at Landlord's expense up to the TI Allowance and subject to payment by Tenant of the Tenant's Share (defined in Section 3.4). The TI Allowance may be applied at Tenant's discretion toward architectural and engineering fees, the construction management fee to Nordblom Development Company (referred to below), consulting fees, hard construction costs, air-conditioning and special electrical power distribution, telephone and security systems and the cost of furniture, fixtures or equipment.  All Base Building Work and the TIW (collectively, the "Landlord's Work") shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable building laws  Tenant shall have the right to require Landlord to use, to the extent practical and where possible, the existing building materials and equipment currently on-site within the Premises (but excluding current furniture) and the so-called "attic stock" within Building 65, an inventory of which is attached to the Building 65 Lease.  Tenant shall advise Landlord on or before
B.
                                    
.
November 24, 2009, which of the items listed in such inventory Tenant desires.  Tenant agrees that Landlord may make any non-material changes in the Landlord's Work which may become reasonably necessary or advisable to accommodate field conditions or to substitute materials of equal or better quality to meet availability schedules, without approval of Tenant, provided written notice is promptly given to Tenant; and Landlord may make other changes in such work reasonably necessary to accommodate unforeseen conditions, with the written approval of Tenant, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Landlord shall use diligence to cause Landlord's Work to be Substantially Completed by the Target Commencement Date, subject to Force Majeure events (defined in Section 10.5 hereof) and any Tenant Delay (defined below).  Tenant shall be required to pay to Nordblom Development Company a project management fee equal to 1.5% of the total construction cost of the TIW for both the Premises and the Building 65 Premises, excluding project management costs, costs for architectural and engineering fees, moving costs and telecommunications wiring and cabling costs.  It is understood that the phrases "TIW", "Landlord's Work" and the "Final Plans," referred to in this Article 3 shall mean the base building work, the tenant improvement work and the plans for both the Premises and the Building 65 Premises together as one integrated tenant improvement project, with the exception of subparagraph A above and Sections 3.6 and 3.7, where the respective meanings of such terms shall only be applicable to the Premises.
 
The phrase, "Tenant Delay", shall be defined as any delay in the completion of Landlord's Work actually caused by (i) work, upgrades or long lead-time items for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay, and in either instance Tenant does not withdraw or alter such special work, upgrade, long lead-time item which avoids such delay, (ii) any changes to any plans, including the Final Plans, made by Tenant, or any Tenant's Change Order, in any case for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay at the time of its approval and for which Tenant does not withdraw such change to avoid delay, (iii) any change in the design of the TIW or any component thereof made by Tenant that results in a delay in the Landlord's construction start date beyond January 3, 2010, (iv) the delay of Tenant or its architects and engineers in providing or approving the Construction Plans or the Proposed GMP, or supplying, submitting or approving any other plans, specifications, pricing or estimates or giving authorizations or supplying information reasonably required by Landlord or its General Contractor or the Town of Burlington by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1, and in this Article 3, or in any other instance if no time period is specified, then within three (3) business days after request therefor, (v) any failure by any contractors employed by Tenant including, without limitation, contractors furnishing telecommunications, data processing or other service or equipment directly to Tenant (and not via Landlord's contractors) to comply with the agreed upon timetables for coordination of the parties' respective components of work, as established at on-site progress meetings between Landlord's representative and Tenant's representative, each acting reasonably and in good faith, (vi) any failure to comply with this Article 3 or any material interference with the performance of Landlord's Work by Tenant or any of its agents, employees, architects, engineers or contractors, or (vii) Tenant's delay in delivering the Original Letter of Credit required pursuant to Section 4.4. No event shall constitute a "Tenant Delay" unless Landlord advises Tenant in writing (which may be by email with a copy to Paul.Jakubowski@WilmerHale.com) of such event within three (3) business days after Landlord becomes aware of its occurrence; however, Landlord need not give Tenant notice of any failure of Tenant to act by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1 and in this Article 3, it being acknowledged that a failure to timely act by such stipulated dates is ipso facto a "Tenant Delay on a day for day basis.

3.2
                                
Late Delivery.
A.  In the event that Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by July 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent first coming due as of the Rent Commencement Date shall be abated by one day for each day of delay during the period beginning on July 1, 2010, and ending on the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  If Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by August 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 2 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on August 1, 2010, and continuing until the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  Further, if the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by September 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event,  then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 3 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on September 1, 2010 and continuing until the day Landlord's Work is Substantially Complete.
 
If the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by October 31, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then Tenant may elect to perform the incomplete Landlord's Work itself, utilizing the funds held under the Construction Escrow Agreement for any incomplete TIW, with any reasonable expenditures for the Base Building Work to be reimbursed by Landlord within 30 days after request therefore with back-up documentation to substantiate the request), failing which, Tenant shall have the right to offset such expenditures against the Fixed Rent next coming due as of the Rent Commencement Date, except that such monthly offset shall not exceed fifteen (15%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated in Section 1.1.C.  If the Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by May 31, 2011, despite Landlord having used diligent efforts to complete the Landlord's Work, and provided the reason for Landlord's inability to complete such work by May 31, 2011 is not due solely to Tenant Delay, then either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to the other party.  If either party timely and properly gives the termination notice, then this Lease shall terminate immediately upon the date of a party's notice.

3.3
                                
Plans and Specifications
   A. Tenant shall be solely responsible for the preparation and submission to Landlord of (a)  the Schematic Design Plans, (b) a full set of architectural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing, construction, design development drawings, including demolition plans sufficient for pricing and permitting equivalent in design completion to more than 50% of the TIW Plans (the "Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans"), and (c) a full CD set of architectural and MEP construction plans and
specifications sufficient to permit and construct the TIW, (called "TIW Plans"), and all other information reasonably required by Landlord and the General Contractor (defined below) necessary obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington and otherwise to perform and complete the TIW.  All plans shall emanate from and be consistent with the approved Schematic Design Plan attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Tenant has assured itself by direct communication with the architect and engineers that the Design Development/ Permitting/Pricing Plans can be submitted to Landlord by the respective dates set forth in Section 1.1.  Additionally, Tenant agrees to cause the TIW Plans to be delivered to Landlord for review before the Final Plans Date and agrees to devote such time as may be necessary in consultation with said architect and engineers to enable them to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.  Tenant shall cause its architect and engineers to cooperate with Landlord and the General Contractor, as reasonably necessary to enable Landlord to obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington for the TIW by January 2, 2010.  Tenant shall also cause its architects and engineers to reasonably cooperate with Landlord or the General Contractor, as applicable, as reasonably necessary to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy from the Town of Burlington. Time is of the essence in respect of the preparation and submission of all plans by Tenant.  If in Landlord's judgment, Tenant's architects and engineers are not cooperating fully or progressing diligently, then Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to engage its own architects and engineers to complete any necessary plans and to supply information, and the like to obtain a building permit by January 2, 2010, or to meet construction schedules and to otherwise avoid delay, but such right to take action on Tenant's behalf to speed the approval process shall not entitle Landlord to make material changes to the Final Plans (defined in paragraph B below); provided, however, if the Town of Burlington requires any change to the Final Plans in order to issue a building permit, Tenant shall cooperate reasonably with Landlord to address the Town's concerns and requests.  The fees of any architect and engineer engaged by Landlord pursuant to the preceding sentence will be paid by Tenant within thirty (30) days after invoice from Landlord.
 
All plans shall require Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.  Landlord shall give Tenant notice, in reasonable detail, of any reasonable objections or concerns Landlord may have with respect to any plans or revised plan, within ten (10) business days after submission by Tenant of its plans and all necessary supporting information.  Landlord shall not be deemed unreasonable for withholding or conditioning approval of plans which (i) involve or are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect any structural element or exterior element of the Building or any portion thereof, or (ii)are reasonably likely, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, to materially adversely affect the value of the Building or any portion thereof, or (iii) are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the proper functioning of the Building systems.  If Landlord objects to any plans, or any portion thereof,  Tenant shall cause the plans to be revised in a manner sufficient to remedy Landlord's objections and respond to Landlord's concerns and redelivered to Landlord within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice of objection.   The aforesaid process shall be repeated until the plans are approved by Landlord.   The final TIW Plans approved by Landlord shall be called the "Final Plans" and will be used to obtain a building permit for the TIW.  Tenant shall use diligence to submit the TIW Plans and any revisions in order to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.

3.4
                                
Cost of TIW; Tenant's Share.
 It is understood that totality of the tenant improvement work being performed in the Premises and in the Building 65 Premises is one integrated construction project pursuant to a single construction contract, and, for the purposes of this Section 3.4, all references to "TIW" shall mean the aggregate tenant improvement work in the Premises and in the Building 65 Premises as shown on the Final Plans. Landlord shall cause the TIW to be performed by Erland Construction (the "General Contractor") and by major subcontractors (which shall be re-insured) selected and engaged by Landlord and the General Contractor, and approved by Tenant, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to reasonably bid each major trade of subcontractor work involved in the TIW, and shall cause the General Contractor to accept the lowest qualified bid submitted for each such trade unless such bid fails to conform to the Final Plans or if Landlord, Tenant and General Contractor reasonably agree otherwise.  Landlord shall provide Tenant with periodic pricing once Landlord receives the Schematic Design Plans.  Within 14 days after receipt of
Subguard
the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to provide Tenant a proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price (the "Proposed GMP") for the TIW.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the Proposed GMP Tenant shall either give Landlord its written approval of the Proposed GMP, or shall cause the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans to be value engineered and revised by means of a "deductive alternative" process for budget control rather than a redesign effort.  The revised Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans shall be subject to Landlord's approval and shall be submitted by Landlord to General Contractor for revised pricing.  The foregoing process shall be repeated utilizing the TIW Plans, if necessary, until the Proposed GMP is approved by Tenant in writing.  Tenant agrees to cause its architects and engineers to use diligence to revise the plans as necessary to achieve an approved GMP no later than December 30, 2009 (as approved, the "Contract Price").  It is expressly understood that any delay by Tenant in approving the GMP by December 30, 2009, will constitute a Tenant Delay on a day-for-day basis for each day from December 30, 2009 until the date the GMP is finally approved by Tenant, and if such period of Tenant Delay actually delays Landlord in achieving Substantial Completion of Landlord's Work by June 1, 2010, then Landlord shall have the right to deem the Commencement Date to have occurred on the date that such Landlord's Work would have been Substantially Completed but for such period of Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work and obtain a permanent certificate of occupancy).  Promptly after approval of the Contract Price and receipt of the Final Plans, Landlord shall release the General Contractor to perform the TIW in accordance with the Final Plans, at Landlord's cost, subject to payment by Tenant of the amount (the "Tenant's Share") by which the Contract Price (subject to adjustment pursuant to the next paragraph) exceeds the TI Allowance.
 
Landlord's affiliate, the Building 65 Landlord, and Tenant have entered into the Construction Escrow Agreement to ensure that funds will be available to pay for the TIW and the Connector Bridge.  Within 21 days after the full execution of this Lease, Landlord shall fund $2,992,950.00 (representing the TI Allowance under this Lease) into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established  pursuant to the terms of the Construction Escrow Agreement, and Tenant shall fund into the Escrow Account the Tenant's Share (adjusted pursuant to the Construction Escrow Agreement once the Tenant's Share is finally determined).  In the event either Landlord or Tenant fails to fully fund its share into the Escrow Account within the aforesaid 21-day period, then the other party may elect to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to the other, effective immediately upon the giving of the notice.
 
Landlord acknowledges that its affiliate, the Building 65 Landlord, is obligated pursuant to Section 3.10 of the Building 65 Lease, to construct the Connector Bridge in order to connect Building 65 to the Premises, and agrees to allow such construction to proceed, in accordance with the Building 65 Lease.  Landlord further acknowledges that $1.600,000.00 will be deposited into the Escrow Account by the Building 65 Landlord to fund the construction of the Connector Bridge, and hereby recognizes Tenant's right, pursuant to the terms of Section 3.10(C) of the Building 65 Lease, to complete any incomplete construction of the Connector Bridge if the Building 65 Landlord has not Substantially Completed construction of the Connector Bridge by the date that is ninety (90) days after the later of (i) the Commencement Date or (ii) the date Tenant opens for business in the Building 65 Premises, utilizing the funds deposited into the Escrow Account for the Connector Bridge.  In the event Tenant properly exercises its right to self-help to complete the Connector Bridge, Landlord shall not take any action against Tenant's exercise of its self-help right nor its right to draw on the funds available in the Escrow Account for completion of the Connector Bridge.
 
After the TIW has been completed, if it is determined that the total payments under the contract with the General Contractor were actually less than the Contract Price, the savings shall be refunded to Tenant, and any savings in the cost of constructing the Connector Bridge shall belong to Landlord, as more specifically set forth in the Construction Escrow Agreement.
 
3.5
                                
Work Change Orders.
  After the Final Plans and the Contract Price have been approved, Tenant may elect to propose changes to the Final Plans ("Tenant's Change Order"). Tenant shall submit each proposed Tenant's Change Order to Landlord for its approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided Tenant's requested change will not affect the compliance of the Building or the Premises with applicable laws.  Landlord agrees to respond to any Tenant's Change Order within such time as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances (taking into consideration the information contained in such Change Order), and in any event no later than five (5) business days following submission by Tenant, advising Tenant of any anticipated increase in costs associated with such Tenant Change Order as well as an estimate of any delay in Landlord's Work (it being understood that a delay, if any, in Landlord's Work caused by such Change Order could result in a deemed Commencement Date pursuant to Section 2.1).  Tenant shall then have the right to approve or withdraw such Tenant's Change Order.  If any Tenant's Change Order is approved as aforesaid, and the applicable Tenant Change Order increases the cost of construction, then before implementing any such change, Landlord will prepare a Work Change Order Form, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, setting forth any adjustment in the Contract Price.  To be valid, the Work Change Order Form must be signed by both parties.  Landlord will maintain an accurate log of all Tenant's Change Orders and will invoice Tenant monthly for the cost of each Tenant Change Order.  Tenant will be required to pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt, except for any Tenant's Change Order of $20,000.00 or more, in which case Tenant will deposit such amount into Escrow Account under the Construction Escrow Agreement the cost of such Tenant's Change Order upon signing the Work Change Order Form.  Landlord shall have no obligation to proceed with any Tenant's Change Order until payment is received or made as aforesaid.
3.6
                                
Acceptance of the Premises.
   Tenant or its representatives may, at reasonable times, enter upon the
Premises during the progress of the work to inspect the progress thereof and to determine if the work is being performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.1. Tenant shall promptly give to Landlord notices of any alleged failure by Landlord to comply with those requirements.  Landlord's Work shall be deemed approved by Tenant when Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business, except for items of Landlord's Work which are uncompleted or do not conform to Exhibit C and the Final Plans and as to which Tenant shall, in either case, have given written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the Commencement Date as set forth in a punch-list as set forth below.  A certificate of completion by Landlord's architect or engineer and a Certificate of Occupancy shall be evidence that Landlord's Work has been completed except for items stated in such certificate to be incomplete or not in conformity with Exhibit C and the Final Plans.  Within five (5) days after the Town of Burlington issues a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, Landlord and Tenant shall meet for the purpose of determining the work remaining in order for Landlord to achieve a final Certificate of Occupancy, each acting reasonably and in good faith, and to select a subsequent date for a joint walk-through of the Premises in order to prepare a punch-list identifying items of Landlord's Work which are incomplete (the "Punch-list Items").  Landlord shall cause such Punch-list Items to be completed within thirty (30) days after the preparation of the list by the parties, unless the parties agree upon any longer time periods.  If Tenant notifies Landlord in writing of the existence of a latent defect in Landlord's Work within one year following the Commencement Date, then Landlord at its expense subject to its General Contractor's warranty will repair such defect.  A "latent defect" is a defect in the construction of the Premises which defect would not ordinarily be observed during a walk-through inspection.
 
3.7
                                
Pre-Commencement Entry.
  With Landlord's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Tenant and its agents and architects shall have the right to enter the Premises after full execution and delivery of this Lease during customary business hours and without payment of rent, but otherwise subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, to facilitate Tenant's preparation of its plans for the TIW so long as such work does not interfere with the performance of any Base Building Work or Landlord's Work and is coordinated with Building management.
 
 
4.1
                                
The Fixed Rent.
  Commencing as of the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay rent to Landlord, by electronic fund transfer (or by such other method, as set forth below, or to such other person or entity as Landlord may by notice in writing to Tenant from time to time direct), at the Annual Fixed Rent Rate, in equal installments at the Monthly Fixed Rent Rate (which is 1/12th of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate), in advance, without notice or demand, and without setoff, abatement, suspension, deferment, reduction or deduction, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, on the first day of each calendar month included in the term; and for any portion of a calendar month following the Rent Commencement Date, at the rate for the first Lease Year payable in advance for such portion. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements, that the Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord shall continue to be payable in all events and that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the requirement to pay or perform the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express provision of this Lease.
 
If Landlord shall give notice to Tenant that all rent and/or other payments due hereunder are to be made to Landlord by check, or by any other commercially reasonable means, Tenant shall make all such payments as shall be due after receipt of said notice by means as designated by Landlord, with such payments to be made to such address and to such person or entity as is specified by Landlord.
 
The Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease are sometimes referred to herein as "Rent."
 
4.2
                                
Additional Rent.
  Tenant covenants and agrees to pay, as Additional Rent, insurance costs, utility charges, personal property taxes and its pro rata share of increases in taxes and operating costs with respect to the Premises and the Property as provided in this Section 4.2 as follows:
 
4.2.1
                      
Real Estate Taxes.
   If Taxes (as hereinafter defined) for any Tax Year during the Term shall exceed Base Taxes, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional rent, for Tenant's Percentage of such excess (such amount hereinafter referred to as "Tax Excess").  Tenant shall remit to Landlord, on the first day of each calendar month, estimated payments on account of Tax Excess, such monthly amounts to be sufficient to provide Landlord, by the time real estate tax payments are due and payable to any governmental authority responsible for collection of same, a sum equal to the Tax Excess, as reasonably estimated by Landlord from time to time on the basis of the most recent tax data available.  If the total of such monthly remittances for any Tax Year is greater than the actual Tax Excess for such Tax year, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the actual Tax Excess for such Tax Year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days after a written  notice to Tenant, which notice shall set forth the manner of computation of Tax Excess).
If, after Tenant shall have made reimbursement to Landlord pursuant to this subsection 4.2.1, Landlord shall receive a refund of any portion of Taxes paid by Tenant with respect to any Tax Year during the term hereof as a result of an abatement of such Taxes by legal proceedings, settlement or otherwise (without either party having any obligation to undertake any such proceedings), Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the Tenant's Percentage of the refund (less the proportional, pro rata expenses, including attorneys' fees and appraisers' fees, incurred in connection with obtaining any such refund), as relates to the Tax Excess paid by Tenant to Landlord with respect to any Tax Year for which such refund is obtained.  At the request of Tenant, from time to time but in no event more than three (3) times during the Original Term, Landlord shall file applications seeking abatements or reductions of Taxes or shall institute proceedings to reduce the assessed valuation of the Property or portions thereof including the Premises with the applicable tax commission or in a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial review of such assessed valuation.  Landlord shall diligently, timely and fully prosecute all such applications and/or proceedings filed or instituted by Landlord.
 
In the event this Lease shall commence, or shall end (by reason of expiration of the term or earlier termination pursuant to the provisions hereof), on any date other than the first or last day of the Tax Year, or should the Tax Year or period of assessment of real estate taxes be changed or be more or less than one (1) year, as the case may be, then the amount of Tax Excess which may be payable by Tenant as provided in this subsection 4.2.1 shall be appropriately apportioned and adjusted.
 
The term "Taxes" shall mean all taxes, assessments, betterments and other charges and impositions (including, but not limited to, fire protection service fees and similar charges) levied or assessed, or which may be equitably attributable to the Property, for or in respect of the Property, at any time during the term by any governmental authority, or taxes in lieu thereof, and additional types of taxes to supplement real estate taxes due to legal limits imposed thereon.  If, at any time during the term of this Lease, any tax or excise on rents or other taxes, however described, are levied or assessed against Landlord with respect to the rent reserved hereunder, either wholly or partially in substitution for, or in addition to, real estate taxes assessed or levied on the Property, such tax or excise on rents shall be included in Taxes.  Taxes shall include any estimated payment made by Landlord on account of a fiscal tax period for which the actual and final amount of taxes for such period has not been determined by the governmental authority as of the date of any such estimated payment.  The following shall be from Taxes and shall be paid solely by Landlord: inheritance, estate, succession, transfer, gift, franchise, or capital stock tax, or any income taxes arising out of or related to ownership and operation of income-producing real estate; or any excise taxes imposed upon Landlord based upon gross or net rentals or other income received by it, any increase in taxes and assessments resulting solely from Landlord's sale of, or other transfer of its interest in, the Building, and assessments, charges, taxes, rents, rates, levies, excises, license fees, permit fees, inspection fees, or other authorization fees or charges to the extent allocable to or caused by the development or installation of off-Premises improvements or utilities (including without limitation street and intersection improvements, roads, rights of way, lighting, and signalization) necessary for any past, present or future system development reimbursement schedule or sinking fund related to any of the foregoing, except to the extent any of the foregoing may be properly allocable to and charged against the Premises pursuant to another provision of this Lease.
excluded
 
Currently, the Building and the adjacent buildings known as 95 Network Drive, 45 Network Drive and 35 Network Drive are located on land which is identified as a single tax parcel included in one tax bill from the Town of Burlington.  Until such time that separate tax parcels are defined and assessed by the Town to include a separately identified tax parcel including the Building and the Premises, Taxes hereunder shall include the Tenant's Percentage of the portion of such Taxes allocated by the Town of Burlington to the Building.
 
4.2.2
                      
Personal Property Taxes.
  Tenant shall pay all taxes charged, assessed or imposed upon the personal property of Tenant in or upon the Premises.
 
4.2.3
                      
Operating Costs.
  If, during the Term hereof, Operating Costs (as hereinafter defined) incurred by Landlord in any calendar year shall exceed Base Operating Costs, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional rent, for Tenant's Percentage of any such excess (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Operating Costs Excess").  Tenant shall remit to Landlord, on the first day of each calendar month, estimated payments on account of Operating Costs Excess, such monthly amounts to be sufficient to provide Landlord, by the end of the calendar year, a sum equal to the Operating Costs Excess, as reasonably estimated by Landlord from time to time.  If, at the expiration of the year in respect of which monthly installments of Operating Costs Excess shall have been made as aforesaid, the total of such monthly remittances is greater than the actual Operating Costs Excess for such year, Landlord shall  within 30 days after such determination pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments of Rent to be made by Tenant, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the Operating Costs Excess for such year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days from the date Landlord shall furnish to Tenant an itemized statement of the Operating Costs Excess, prepared, allocated and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Landlord shall keep, in the Building Manager's office, complete books and records regarding Operating Costs and Taxes.  Tenant and its representatives, at Tenant's sole expense, shall have the right, during customary business hours, to inspect at Landlord's offices, Landlord's books and records relating to Operating Costs for the immediately preceding calendar year.  As a condition to performing any such inspection, Tenant and its examiners shall be required to execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, agreeing to keep confidential any information which Tenant and the examining party discover about the Building in connection with such examination, except for disclosures required by law, court order or regulatory authorities, or to Tenant's attorneys, accountants, auditors, or potential purchasers of  the Tenant company.  If Tenant elects to exercise such right, it must provide reasonable prior written notice to Landlord given no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Statement of Operating Costs for any calendar year and it must complete any such inspection within 60 days of commencement.  Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant to enable Tenant to complete its inspection within the time period specified in the preceding sentence.  If Landlord is obligated to reimburse Tenant for the cost of the audit as provided below, Tenant shall give Landlord a complete copy of the results of its inspection.  If it is determined that Tenant is entitled to a refund, then such refund shall either be in cash or applied as a credit to the next due installment of Rent, at the election of Landlord.  If it is determined Tenant has underpaid, then Tenant shall pay such amount within thirty (30) days of Landlord's invoice therefor.  Tenant agrees to use for such inspection a firm that is reasonably acceptable to Landlord and that is not being paid on a contingency fee basis. If Operating Costs were overstated by more than three percent (3%), then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the reasonable cost of the audit.
 
Any reimbursement for Operating Costs due and payable by Tenant with respect to periods of less than twelve (12) months shall be equitably prorated.
 
The term "Operating Costs" shall mean all costs and expenses incurred for the operation, cleaning, maintenance, repair and upkeep of the Property, and the portion of such costs and expenses with  regard to the Campus Common Areas which is equitably allocable to the Property, including, without limitation, all costs of maintaining and repairing the Property and the Park (including snow removal, landscaping and grounds maintenance, operation and maintenance of parking lots, sidewalks, walking paths, access roads and driveways, Building exterior and service areas, security, operation and repair of heating and air-conditioning equipment, elevators, lighting and any other Building equipment or systems) and of all repairs and replacements (other than repairs or replacements for which Landlord has received full reimbursement from contractors or from others) necessary to keep the Property and the Park in good working order, repair, appearance and condition; all payments under any cross easement agreement, declaration of restrictive covenants and like instruments pertaining to the sharing of costs by the Building and other buildings in the Park; all costs of maintenance and repair of the Connector Bridge; all costs, including material and equipment costs, for cleaning and janitorial services to the Building and the Connector Bridge, including window cleaning of the Building and the Connector Bridge; all costs of any reasonable insurance carried by Landlord relating to the Property; all costs related to provision of heat (including electric, and/or gas), chilled water for air-conditioning, and water (including sewer charges) and other utilities to the Premises, if not sub-metered, and to the Property, including all charges for electricity and chilled water furnished by the Building systems to the Connector Bridge; payments under all service contracts relating to the foregoing; all compensation, fringe benefits, payroll taxes and workmen's compensation insurance premiums related thereto with respect to any employees of Landlord or its affiliates engaged in security and maintenance of the Property and the Park; costs of maintaining and operating any amenities available for the general use of all tenants now or hereafter located in the Campus Common Areas including an on-site cafeteria (including a monthly cafeteria subsidy, if any); attorney's fees and disbursement in connection with tax abatement proceedings; auditing and other professional fees and expenses; and a management fee in line with local market rates for similar Class  A buildings (during the Original Term, 3% of the gross collected Rents).
 
The following items shall be excluded in Landlord's calculation of Operating Costs:
 
1.             leasing commissions, fees and costs, advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred in procuring tenants or in selling the Building or the Park;
 
2.             attorney's fees except as set forth above;

5.             depreciation, except on materials, tools, supplies and vendor-type equipment purchased by Landlord to enable Landlord to supply services Landlord might otherwise contract for with a third party where such depreciation and interest payments would otherwise have been included in the charge for such third party's services, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and when depreciation is permitted or required;
6.             rental on ground leases or other underlying leases and the costs of providing the same;
 
7.             wages, bonuses and other compensation of employees above the grade of Property Manager;

 Lease Year to replace worn-out items as may be necessary to maintain the Building in good working order, repair, appearance and in first-class condition, and not to enhance the Building over and above its current appearance and condition, (the items in clauses (a), (b) and (c) are collectively called "capital expenditures"), the total amount of which is not properly included in Operating Costs for the calendar year in which they were made, there shall nevertheless be included in Operating Costs for each calendar year in which and after such capital expenditure is made the annual charge-off of such capital expenditure.  The annual charge-off shall be determined by (i)  dividing the original cost of the capital expenditure by the number of years of useful life thereof  as  reasonably determined by Landlord; and (ii)  adding to such quotient an interest factor computed on the unamortized balance of such capital expenditure based upon an interest rate reasonably determined by Landlord as being the interest rate then being charged for long-term mortgages by institutional lenders on like properties within the locality in which the Building is located.  Except for the annual charge-off described above, no portion of any capital expenditures shall be included within Operating Costs. Landlord covenants that it will not grant to any future tenant of the Park (to the extent Landlord, or its affiliates, controls other buildings in the Park) rights regarding capital expenditures that are more favorable in such regard than this provision is for Tenant.
 
If during the calendar year for which Base Operating Costs are being computed, the Building was not fully occupied by tenants or if Landlord was not supplying all tenants with the services, amenities or benefits being supplied hereunder, the categories of Operating Costs which vary with occupancy shall be reasonably extrapolated by Landlord to the estimated Operating Costs that would have been incurred if the Building were fully occupied by tenants or if such services were being supplied to all tenants, and such extrapolated amount shall, for the purposes of this Section 4.2.3, be deemed to be the Base Operating Costs.
 
4.2.4
                       
Insurance.
  Tenant shall, at its expense, as Additional Rent, take out and maintain throughout the term the following insurance protecting Landlord:
 
Commercial general liability insurance naming Landlord, Tenant, and Landlord's managing agent and any mortgagee of which Tenant has been given notice as additional insureds and indemnifying the parties so named against all claims and demands for death or any injury to person or damage to property which may be claimed to have occurred on the Premises, including the Connector Bridge (or the Property, insofar as used by customers, employees, servants or invitees of the Tenant), in amounts which shall, at the beginning of the term, be at least equal to the limits set forth in Section 1.1, and, which, from time to time during the term, shall be for such higher limits, if any, as are customarily carried in the area in which the Premises are located on property similar to the Premises and used for similar purposes; and workmen's compensation insurance with statutory limits covering all of Tenant's employees working on the Premises.
4.2.4.1
              
 
"Special Risk" property insurance with the usual extended coverage endorsements covering all Tenant's furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment, and business interruption insurance with extra expense coverage.
4.2.4.2
              
 
All such policies shall be obtained from responsible companies qualified to do business and in good standing in Massachusetts, which companies and the amount of insurance allocated thereto shall be subject to Landlord's approval.  Tenant agrees to furnish Landlord with certificates evidencing all such insurance prior to the beginning of the term hereof and evidencing renewal thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of any such policy.  Each such policy shall be non-cancelable with respect to the interest of Landlord and the insurer will endeavor to notify Landlord at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of any policy, but in any event no later than five (5) days following cancelation thereof.
4.2.4.3
              
 
All insurance which is carried by either Landlord or Tenant with respect to the Building, Premises or to furniture, furnishings, fixtures, or equipment therein or alterations or improvements thereto, whether or not required, shall include provisions which either
4.2.4.4
              
designate the other party as one of the insured or deny to the insurer acquisition by subrogation of rights of recovery against the other party to the extent such rights have been waived by the insured party prior to occurrence of loss or injury, insofar as, and to the extent that, such provisions may be effective without making it impossible to obtain insurance coverage from responsible companies qualified to do business in the state in which the Premises are located (even though extra premium may result therefrom).  In the event that extra premium is payable by either party as a result of this provision, the other party shall reimburse the party paying such premium the amount of such extra premium.  If at the request of one party, this non-subrogation provision is waived, then the obligation of reimbursement shall cease for such period of time as such waiver shall be effective, but nothing contained in this subsection shall derogate from or otherwise affect releases elsewhere herein contained of either party for claims.  Each party shall be entitled to have certificates of any policies containing such provisions.  Each party hereby waives all rights of recovery against the other for loss or injury against which the waiving party is protected by insurance containing said provisions, reserving, however, any rights with respect to any excess of loss or injury over the amount recovered by such insurance.
 
4.2.5
                       
Utilities.
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord through Operating Costs, pursuant to Section 4.2.3, for all charges for gas and chilled water for normal office heating and air-conditioning to the Premises and chilled water and electricity to the Connector Bridge, and water for ordinary cleaning and lavatory use during the Term.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord by means of monthly escrow payments (as hereinafter set forth) for all charges for the cost of electricity for Tenant's lights, outlets and VAV boxes, and for usage of electricity and chilled water for Tenant's special requirements at the Premises. Commencing as of the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, estimated charges (the "Utilities Charges") on account of Tenant's consumption of electricity in the Premises for its lights, outlets, and VAV boxes, and for usage of electricity and chilled water consumption for Tenant's special requirements at the Premises.  Landlord shall reasonably estimate the amount of Utilities Charges payable by Tenant per month and shall notify Tenant prior to the Commencement Date of the initial estimate of Utilities Charges to be paid by Tenant.  Tenant shall pay the Utilities Charges on the first day of each calendar month included in the Term, in the same manner as Tenant pays Fixed Rent pursuant to Section 4.1 above. Following Landlord's receipt of utility provider invoices, Landlord will reconcile the estimated Utilities Charges paid by Tenant with the actual amounts owing from Tenant based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity used in the Premises for the preceding month as registered on the sub-meters for the Premises based on the excess chilled water consumption as registered on the BTU meters for the areas of excess use.  If it is determined Tenant has been overcharged, then such overpayment will be refunded to Tenant within thirty (30) days after such determination or credited against Tenant's account for the following month.  If Tenant has underpaid, then Landlord will invoice Tenant for the amount owed and Tenant shall pay such amount within thirty (30) days after billing. Landlord reserves the right to adjust the monthly Utilities Charges from time to time based on the most current data available for Tenant's electrical  and chilled water consumption in the Premises, and Tenant shall thereafter pay the adjusted Utilities Charges to Landlord until further notice.  Additionally, Tenant shall pay all charges for telephone and other utilities or services not supplied by Landlord, whether designated as a charge, tax, assessment, fee or otherwise, all such charges to be paid as the same from time to time become due.  Except as otherwise provided in Article 5, it is understood and agreed that Tenant shall make its own arrangements for the installation or provision of all such utilities and that Landlord shall be under no obligation to furnish any utilities to the Premises and shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any such utilities to the Premises.
 
4.3
                                
Late Payment of Rent.
  If any installment of Fixed Rent is paid five (5) or more days after notice that the same is overdue, and if on a prior occasion in the twelve (12) month period prior to the date such installment was due an installment of rent was paid after the same was due, then Tenant shall pay Landlord a late payment fee equal to five (5%) percent of the current overdue payment.
 
4.4
                                
Letter of Credit.
The performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall be secured by a letter of credit throughout the term hereof in accordance with and subject to the following terms and conditions:
 
4.4.1
       
Amount of Letter of Credit.
   Concurrently with Tenant's execution and delivery of this Lease,  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the "Original Letter of Credit") which shall be (i) in the form of Exhibit H attached to this Lease (the "Form LC"), (ii) issued by a commercial bank reasonably satisfactory to Landlord upon which presentment may be made in Boston, Massachusetts, (iii) in the amount equal to the Letter of Credit Amount, and (iv) for a term of at least 1 year, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4.2 below.  The Original Letter of Credit, any Additional Letters(s) of Credit and Substitute Letter(s) of Credit are referred to herein as the "Letter of Credit."
 
4.4.2
       
Renewal of Letter of Credit.
 Each Letter of Credit shall be automatically renewable in accordance with the second to last paragraph of the Form LC; provided however, that Tenant shall be required to deliver to Landlord a new letter of credit (a "Substitute Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit under Section 4.4.1 on or before the date 30 days prior to the expiration of the term of the Letter of Credit then in effect, if the issuer of such Letter of Credit gives notice of its election not to renew such Letter of Credit for any additional period pursuant thereto.  Should any Letter of Credit contain a final expiration date, in addition to a current expiration date, such final expiration date shall be no earlier than 45 days following the Expiration Date of this Lease.  If Tenant does not deliver a Substitute
Letter of Credit 30 days prior to the expiration of the current Letter of Credit, Landlord shall be permitted to draw down the entire Letter of Credit Amount and hold the cash as "Security Proceeds" pursuant to Section 4.4.6 below.
 
4.4.3
       
Draws to Cure Defaults.
  If the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum payable to Landlord hereunder shall be overdue and unpaid or should Landlord make payments on behalf of the Tenant, or Tenant shall fail to perform any of the terms of this Lease in all cases beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit the amount necessary to cure such default. In the event of any such draw by the Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an additional Letter of Credit ("Additional Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit, except that the amount of such Additional Letter of Credit shall be the amount of such draw, or (b) a substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Original Letter of Credit).
 
4.4.4
       
Draws to Pay Damages.
  In addition, if (i) this Lease shall have been terminated as a result of Tenant's default under this Lease beyond the expiration of the applicable cure period, and/or (ii) this Lease shall have been rejected in a bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding, then Landlord shall have the right at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit an amount sufficient to pay any and all damages payable by Tenant on account of such termination or rejection, as the case may be, pursuant to Article 8 hereof. In the event of bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding against Tenant, all proceeds of the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.
 
4.4.5
       
Issuing Bank.
  In the event the issuer of any Letter of Credit becomes insolvent or is placed into receivership or conservatorship by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any successor or similar entity, or if a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for the issuer, then, effective as of the date of such occurrence, the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to not meet the requirements of this Section 4.4 and Tenant shall, within five (5) business days of written notice from Landlord, deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit which otherwise meets the requirements of this Section, or, alternatively, Tenant shall, within such five (5) business-day period deliver cash to Landlord in the Letter of Credit Amount, which Landlord shall hold as "Security Proceeds", governed by the provisions of Section 4.4.6 below.
 
4.4.6
       
Draws for Failure to  Deliver Substitute Letter of Credit.
  If Tenant fails timely to deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter, without giving any notice to Tenant, to draw down the Letter of Credit and to hold the proceeds thereof  ("Security Proceeds") in a bank account in the name of Landlord, which may be withdrawn and applied by Landlord under the same circumstances and for the same purposes as if the Security Proceeds were a Letter of Credit. Upon any such application of Security Proceeds by Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an Additional Letter of Credit in the amount of Security Proceeds so applied, or (b) a Substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Security Proceeds.
 
4.4.7
       
Transferability.
Landlord shall be entitled to transfer its beneficial interest under the Letter of Credit or any Security Proceeds in connection with (i) Landlord's sale or transfer of the Building, or (ii) the addition, deletion or modification of any beneficiaries under the Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit shall specifically state on its face that it is transferable by Landlord, its successors and assigns.  Landlord  shall be responsible for all costs and fees charged to effect such transfer.
 
4.4.8
       
Return of Letter of Credit at End of Term.
Within 45 days after the expiration of  the term, to the extent Landlord has not previously drawn upon any Letter of Credit or Security Proceeds held by Landlord, Landlord shall return the same to Tenant, less so much thereof that Landlord reasonably estimates is necessary to compensate Landlord toward the curing of any continuing default of any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, specifically including any restoration obligations under Section 6.1.9.
 
4.4.9
       
Reduction in Letter of Credit Amount.
On the condition that (a) Tenant is not in default at the time of the applicable reduction, (b) has not been in default of its monetary obligations under this Lease more than two times during the Term, (c) Tenant has had a net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year of Tenant prior to the applicable reduction (the "Profitability Test") as shown on Tenant's Consolidated Statement of Operations in its most recent audited annual report, and (d) to the extent Tenant is no longer a public company, Tenant provides Landlord with an audited statement reporting satisfaction of the Profitability Test, then the Letter of Credit Amount shall be reduced as follows:
 
at the end of the 2 Lease Year, by $233,131.00;
(i)

(iii)
                              
th
 
If Tenant fails to qualify for any reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount due solely to Tenant's inability to satisfy the Profitability Test as of the date of the applicable reduction, Tenant shall nevertheless be permitted to effect a reduction of $233,131.00 at any time after the stated reduction date once Tenant satisfies the Profitability Test and delivers proof thereof to Landlord, provided that Tenant otherwise satisfies the remaining conditions listed above in this Section 4.4.9.  Any reduction in the Letter of Credit
Amount for which Tenant qualifies after the applicable reduction date shall not diminish or postpone any subsequent reduction.  Except as provided above, there shall be no reductions in the Letter of Credit Amount, it being understood that at no time shall the Letter of Credit Amount be less than $699,395.00.  Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for taking all necessary steps to effect a reduction, provided however that Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant to amend the Letter of Credit or obtain a Substitute Letter of Credit, as applicable, at no cost to Landlord.
 
 
5.1
                                
Affirmative Covenants.
  Landlord covenants with Tenant:
 
5.1.1
                       
Heat and Air-Conditioning.
  To furnish to the Premises heat and air-conditioning (reserving the right, at any time, to change energy or heat sources) sufficient to maintain the Premises at comfortable temperatures (subject to all federal, state, and local regulations relating to the provision of heat), during the hours of 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays and 7:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays ("Normal Business Hours"), excluding all legal holidays on which the Building is normally closed.  All charges for gas and chilled water furnished to the Premises for normal office heating and normal office air-conditioning, and to the Connector Bridge, will be included in Operating Costs pursuant to Section 4.2.3 and paid for by Tenant pursuant to said Section 4.2.3.  Tenant understands that approximately 8 tons of process chilled water and some hot water will be furnished by the Building systems to cool and heat the Connector Bridge.  Heat and air-conditioning for the Premises will be available to Tenant after Normal Business Hours by prior request of Landlord's managing agent at least 24 hours in advance.  As of the date of this Lease, Landlord estimates the after-hours charge for heating or cooling an entire wing is $80.00 per wing per hour based on current utility costs.  The after-hours cost is allocated per wing not per floor, and shall be based upon utility costs to Landlord, taking into account wear and tear on equipment.  The rate of increase in the after-hours charges shall not exceed the rate of increase in the utility costs to Landlord.  If Tenant shall use chilled water after Normal Business Hours and if such after-hours use shall result in an additional cost to Landlord on account thereof, Tenant shall, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for the actual utility costs plus any additional costs as reasonably estimated by Landlord (such as wear and tear on the equipment).  If Tenant shall use chilled water in excess of reasonable quantities for normal office air-conditioning, then Landlord reserves the right to install a separate meter or sub-meter, at Tenant's expense, to measure the flow of chilled water to the Premises, if deemed necessary by Landlord, and Tenant shall pay Utilities Charges for the excess chilled water pursuant to Section 4.2.5 above.  The phrase "normal office air-conditioning" wherever used in this Lease means cooling at 1 CFM per square foot averaged over the square footage of the Premises with 55 discharge air and 75 thermostat set points.

Electricity.
  To furnish to the Premises, separately sub-metered and paid for by Tenant directly to Landlord, as provided in Section 4.2.5 above, electricity for Tenant's lights, outlets and VAV boxes. If Tenant shall require electricity in excess of normal office use for Tenant's Permitted Uses, then Landlord reserves the right to install a sub-meter, at Tenant's expense, to measure Tenant's excessive usage and will bill Tenant separately for its excessive usage.  In addition, if (i)  in Landlord's reasonable judgment, Landlord's facilities are inadequate for such excess requirements, or (ii) such excess use shall result in an additional burden on the Building utilities systems and additional cost to Landlord on account thereof, as the case may be, (a)  Tenant shall, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for such additional cost, as aforesaid, or (b)  Landlord, upon written request, and at the sole cost and expense of Tenant, will furnish and install such additional wire, conduits, feeders, switchboards and appurtenances  and other electrical system upgrades as reasonably may be required to supply such additional requirements of Tenant (if electricity therefor is then available to Landlord), provided that the same shall be permitted by applicable laws and insurance regulations and shall not cause permanent damage or injury to the Building or cause or create a dangerous or hazardous condition or entail excessive or unreasonable alterations or repairs. Tenant shall be entitled to use at least the Tenant's Percentage of the Building's available conduit and chase space.
 
.  The Building is equipped with a 800 kw standby generator (the "Building Generator") which is utilized for building-wide emergency systems.  Tenant shall be permitted to use its proportionate share (i.e., based on the Premises rentable square footage) of the Building Generator's available capacity for Tenant's "special needs" areas.  If Tenant requires additional generator capacity, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to accommodate Tenant's needs.

An "Abatement Event" shall be defined as an event or circumstance (other than those addressed in Article 7) that reasonably prevents Tenant from using the entire Premises, or any material portion thereof, or the parking areas of the Property as a result of Landlord's failure to provide any service required to be provided by Landlord under this Lease that is essential for Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Premises, or to provide reasonable access to the Premises, provided that such failure or Landlord's inability to remedy such event or circumstance is not due to a cause beyond Landlord's reasonable control generally affecting other buildings in the vicinity of the Premises (such as a neighborhood power outage).  Tenant shall give Landlord notice (an "Abatement Notice") of any such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement Event continues beyond the "Eligibility Period" (as that term is defined below), then the Monthly Fixed Rent and monthly charges on account of Operating Costs Excess and Tax Excess shall be abated entirely or proportionately, as the case may be, after the expiration of the Eligibility Period for such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable area of the Premises.  Tenant shall not be entitled to an abatement of Rent if Tenant is then in default of its monetary obligations beyond the expiration of all notice and cure periods under this Lease.  The term "Eligibility Period" shall mean a period of five (5) consecutive business days after Landlord's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s).

Tenant may also elect to perform certain of the Landlord-provided services (such as cleaning) utilizing outside vendors. If Landlord approves the installation and/or utilization of such services, such installation and utilization shall be at Tenant's sole cost, risk and expense, in which event all costs relating to the provision of such services shall be excluded from "Operating Costs".

Access.
  Subject to Landlord's security requirements (if any), Tenant shall have access to the Building and the parking area serving the Building 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Landlord shall construct or provide, at its sole expense, and maintain throughout the Term an unstaffed fitness center in the Park for general availability to all tenants, with no user or membership fees charged to Tenant and its employees.  The fitness center will contain men's and women's locker rooms with shower facilities, cardio equipment, free weights, strength training equipment and stretching areas.  Landlord agrees to complete such fitness center no later than the Commencement Date and operate the same throughout the Term.  Regarding the conference center, Landlord shall assist Tenant in arranging for access to a shared conference facility, which is currently leased to Sun.  Sun has indicated to Landlord that it will work with other tenants of the Park to provide reasonable access to such conference facility, at Sun's discretion.  Landlord agrees to continue to operate a caf and catering service and fitness center of substantially comparable quality, general size and services throughout the Term.

defend Tenant, and Landlord's obligation to indemnify Tenant in such cases shall apply only if such employee's claim prevails, despite Tenant having used reasonable efforts to defend such claim, in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction through final judgment, with no further appeal.  Landlord shall not be responsible for any claims for consequential damages or lost profits of Tenant.  Tenant hereby acknowledges receipt of the Phase 1 Report.

It is understood that Landlord has imposed the foregoing prohibition for the benefit of Sun, and Tenant acknowledges that Sun is a third party beneficiary of the foregoing restriction and use prohibition.  If Tenant allows of the Premises to be used or occupied by any of the Prohibited Occupants in violation of this provision, Landlord may take any and all action necessary to cause such use or occupancy to cease.  During the Term of this Lease, if Sun seeks to reduce the premises under the Sun Lease, Landlord agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain an agreement by Sun to eliminate the foregoing described use restriction.
 
   To maintain the Premises in neat order and condition and to perform all routine and ordinary repairs to the Premises and to any plumbing, heating, electrical, ventilating and air-conditioning systems or other specialty systems located within or outside of the Premises and installed by Tenant such as are necessary to keep them in good working order, appearance and condition, as the case may require, reasonable use and wear thereof and damage by fire or by unavoidable casualty only excepted; to keep all glass in windows and doors of the Premises (except glass in the exterior walls of the Building) whole and in good condition with glass of the same quality as that injured or broken; and to make as and when needed as a result of misuse by, or neglect or improper conduct of Tenant or Tenant's servants, employees, agents, invitees or licensees or otherwise, all repairs necessary, which repairs and replacements shall be in quality and class equal to the original work.  (Landlord, upon default of Tenant beyond the expiration of the applicable notice and cure periods hereunder [except in emergencies where immediate action may be taken], may elect, at the expense of Tenant, and upon three (3) business days' prior written notice or fewer if reasonable under the circumstances, to perform all such cleaning and maintenance and to make any such repairs or to repair any damage or injury to the Building or the Premises caused by moving property of Tenant in or out of the Building, or by installation or removal of furniture or other property, or by misuse by, or neglect, or improper conduct of, Tenant or Tenant's servants, employees, agents, contractors, customers, patrons, invitees, or licensees.)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant shall not be responsible for compliance with any such laws, regulations, or the like requiring (a) structural repairs or modifications; or (b) repairs or modifications to the utility or building service equipment; or (c) installation of new building service equipment, such as fire detection or suppression equipment, unless such repairs, modifications, or installations shall be due to Tenant's particular manner of use of the Premises (as opposed to office use generally) or required on account of any work done by or on behalf of Tenant.
6.1.4
                       
Compliance with Law.
 
   To save harmless, exonerate and indemnify Landlord, its agents (including, without limitation, Landlord's managing agent) and employees (such agents and employees being referred to collectively as the "Landlord Related Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities or penalties asserted by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or public authority on account of injury, death, damage or loss to person or property in or upon the Premises, including the Connector Bridge, and the Property or on the Campus Common Areas arising out of the use or occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or by any person claiming by, through or under Tenant (including, without limitation, all patrons, employees and customers of Tenant), or arising out of any delivery to or service supplied to the Premises, or on account of or based upon anything whatsoever done on the Premises, except if the same was caused by the willful negligence, fault or misconduct of Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties.  In respect of all of the foregoing, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties from and against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and liabilities incurred in or in connection with any such claim, action or proceeding brought thereon; and, in case of any action or proceeding brought against Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties by reason of any such claim, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord and at Tenant's expense, shall resist or defend such action or proceeding and employ counsel therefor reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.

Landlord's entry shall be subject to Tenant's reasonable security rules, including the requirement that Landlord be accompanied by a Tenant representative (except in emergency circumstances).

   At the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease:  to surrender all keys to the Premises; to remove all of its trade fixtures and personal property in the Premises; to deliver to Landlord stamped architectural plans showing the Premises at yield up (which may be the Final Plans  if Tenant has made no installations after the Commencement Date); to remove all wiring and cabling; to remove all rooftop equipment, and such installations and alterations made by it, including the TIW, as Landlord had designated for removal at the time of Landlord's approval of such installations or alterations, as set forth below and all Tenant's signs wherever located; to repair all damage caused by such removal and restore any damaged areas to normal office finishes standard for the Building; and to yield up the Premises (including all installations and improvements made by Tenant (which shall be intact and in good working order, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted) except for Tenant's trade fixtures and such of said installations or improvements as Landlord shall have requested Tenant to remove at the time of plan approval as set forth below.  Landlord reserves the right to require removal of any alterations for which plans were not required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.2.5 of this Lease, if Tenant had failed to so request Landlord's designation for removal as set forth in Section 6.2.5.  Tenant shall surrender the Premises broom-clean and in the condition the same were in on the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted. Tenant, at the time of requesting Landlord's approval of any installations or alterations in the Premises, including the TIW and any Tenant's Work Change Orders (whether or not plans are required for the installation) shall request in writing that Landlord designate which such installations or alterations must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  After receipt of Tenant's request, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing which such installations or alterations must be removed from the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord does not indicate that a particular installation must be removed, then Landlord shall not later have the right to request its removal.  Likewise, if Tenant, when making any installations or alterations, fails to so request in writing whether Landlord will require removal of such installation or alteration, then Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to remove the installation or alteration at the end of the Term.  With respect to the TIW, Tenant need not make a formal written request; however, Landlord shall, as part of its approval of the Schematic Design Plans provide a preliminary summary of which items, if any, it requires be removed.  Landlord will provide Tenant with a progress summary of items designated for removal as soon as practical following receipt of the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, taking into consideration that the resulting Final Plans may necessitate amendment of Landlord's summary of items that require end of term removal.  In any event, Landlord agrees to be reasonable in determining whether any installation or alteration must be removed and agrees to limit its removal requirements to those installations or alterations that Landlord deems specialized for Tenant's use and not typical for normal office tenant use (such as specialty process electrical systems, chillers, generators, and nitrogen tanks, by way of example, but not finishes and architectural elements included in the TIW).  Any property required to be removed that is not so removed shall be deemed abandoned and, if Landlord so elects, deemed to be Landlord's property, and may be retained or removed and disposed of by Landlord in such manner as Landlord shall determine and Tenant shall pay Landlord the entire cost and expense incurred by it in effecting such removal and disposition and in making any incidental repairs and replacements to the Premises.  Tenant shall further indemnify Landlord against all loss, cost and damage resulting from Tenant's failure and delay in surrendering the Premises as above provided; however, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages if Tenant occupies the Premises for fewer than thirty (30) days beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  Except as specifically provided for in this Section 6.1.9, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages for breach of any provision of this Lease.
6.1.9
                       
Yield Up.
 
If the Tenant remains in the Premises beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, such holding over shall be without right and shall not be deemed to create any tenancy, but the Tenant shall be a tenant at sufferance only at a daily rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent in effect under this Lease as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease, for the first thirty (30) days of such holding over, and thereafter at a daily rate of two (2) times the Rent in effect as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease.
 
  To comply with the Rules and Regulations set forth in Exhibit E, and with all reasonable Rules and Regulations of general applicability to all tenants of the Park hereafter made by Landlord, and of which Tenant has been given notice, concerning, among other things, the use of the cafeteria and fitness center and conference center. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for the failure of other tenants to conform to such Rules and Regulations, of which Tenant has been given notice. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to enforce the Rules and Regulations and shall apply the same in a non-discriminatory manner.

hereunder and, if so, the dates to which they have been paid, (iii) whether or not Landlord is in default in performance of any of the terms of this Lease, (iv) whether Tenant has accepted possession of the Premises, (v) whether Tenant has made any claim against Landlord under this Lease and, if so, the nature thereof and the dollar amount, if any, of such claim, (vi) whether there exist any offsets or defenses against enforcement of any of the terms of this Lease upon the part of Tenant to be performed, and (vii) such further information with respect to the Lease or the Premises as Landlord may reasonably request.  Any such statement delivered pursuant to this subsection 6.1.11 may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Premises, or any prospective assignee of such mortgage.  Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord such financial information as may be reasonably required by Landlord to be provided to any mortgagee or prospective purchaser of the Premises.  The requirement of the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.

   Tenant covenants at all times during the term and such further time (prior or subsequent thereto) as Tenant occupies the Premises or any part thereof:

Negative Covenants.
 
  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, not to assign, transfer, mortgage or pledge this Lease or to sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions and licenses and the like) all or any part of the Premises or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate hereby created or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned, transferred or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, or permit the occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord.  In the event Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublet any portion or all of the Premises (whether to a Successor or Affiliate or to a third party), Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of Tenant's intent to so assign this Lease or sublet the Premises and the proposed effective date of such subletting or assignment, and in the case of a transfer to a third party, shall request in such notification that Landlord consent thereto.  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, Landlord may terminate this Lease in the case of a proposed assignment or any proposed sublet of all or any portion of the Premises for the remainder of the Term; and, in the case of any proposed subletting that results in more than 30% of Tenant's space in the Premises and in the Building 75 Premises, in the aggregate, being sublet space, whether via one sublease or multiple subleases, (but in no event resulting in more than fifty (50%) of the Premises being sublet) Landlord may recapture that space proposed for subletting and terminate this Lease in part with respect to the entire sublet space or the newly proposed sublet space, as applicable. If Landlord exercises its recapture right, it shall do so by giving written notice of termination to Tenant within ten (10) days after Tenant's request for consent and Landlord's receipt of all relevant information reasonably required by Landlord, with such termination to be effective as of the effective date of such assignment or subletting.  Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed a waiver of its recapture right.  If Landlord does not so terminate or is deemed to have waived its right to terminate, Landlord's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld to an assignment or to a subletting, provided that the following conditions are met:
6.2.1
                       
Assignment and Subletting.
 
the assignee or subtenant shall use the Premises only for the Permitted Uses;
(i)
                                    
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant has a net worth and, in the case of an assignee, creditworthiness, reasonably sufficient to enable it to perform the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, or the sublease, as applicable;
(ii)
                                 
 
the amount of the aggregate rent to be paid by the proposed subtenant is not less than eighty (80%) percent of the then current market rate for the Premises; and
(iii)
                              
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant is not then a tenant in the Building or the Park, or an entity with which Landlord is dealing or has dealt within the preceding six months regarding the possibility of leasing space in the Building or the Park and Landlord actually has available reasonably comparable space in the Park;
(iv)
                             
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant is not a Prohibited Occupant as defined under subsection 6.1.2.1.
(v)
                                
 
Tenant shall furnish Landlord with any information reasonably requested by Landlord to enable Landlord to determine whether the proposed assignment or subletting complies with the foregoing requirements, including without limitation, financial statements relating to the proposed assignee or subtenant.  Tenant's rights under Sections 2.3, and 6.2.5.1 are personal to the initial named Tenant and may not be assigned except (a) in connection with an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor, and (b) in connection with an assignment of this Lease and the Building 65 Lease together in their entirety to a single assignee of both leases.
 
Tenant shall, as Additional Rent, reimburse Landlord promptly for Landlord's reasonable legal expenses incurred in connection with any request by Tenant for such consent.  If Landlord consents thereto, no such subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder, and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation to obtain the Landlord's written approval in the case of any other subletting or assignment.
 
If for any assignment or sublease consented to by Landlord hereunder Tenant receives rent or other consideration, either initially or over the term of the assignment or sublease, in excess of the rent called for hereunder, or in case of sublease of part, in excess of such rent fairly allocable to the part. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent fifty (50%) percent of the excess of each such payment of rent or other consideration received by Tenant promptly after its receipt.  In calculating any excess rent payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this provision, Tenant shall first be entitled to deduct (a) the gross Fixed Rent and Additional Rent paid to Landlord by Tenant with respect to the subject portion of the Premises during the period commencing on the date Tenant vacates the subject portion of the Premises until the date the assignee or sublessee is obligated to pay rent pursuant to its assignment or sublease; (b) improvement allowances or other economic concessions granted by Tenant to the assignee or sublessee; (c) the unamortized costs of initial and subsequent improvements to the sublet portion of the Premises paid for by Tenant and amortized over the sublease term; (d) costs incurred by Tenant to buy out or take over the previous lease of the assignee or sublessee; (e) all costs incurred by Tenant to advertise the subject portion of the Premises for assignment or sublease; (f) brokerage commissions and legal fees paid by Tenant in connection with the assignment or sublease, and (g) all other costs reasonably incurred by Tenant.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, the preceding provisions of this Section 6.2.1 shall not apply to a sublet of all or any portion of the Premises or an assignment of this Lease to either (i) an entity which is controlled by, is under common control with, or which controls Tenant (any of the foregoing, an "Affiliate") or (ii) an entity into or with which Tenant is merged or consolidated or which acquires all or substantially all of Tenant's stock or assets (any of the foregoing, a "Successor"), provided that in the case of an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor (1) such Affiliate or Successor, as the case may be, agrees directly with Landlord, by written instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, to assume and perform all the obligations of Tenant; (2) Tenant continues to remain primarily liable under this Lease; and (3) Tenant notifies Landlord of the merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, stock or membership interests at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such transfer (except where the transaction must for legal and reasonable business purposes remain confidential, in which event such proof of net worth shall be delivered promptly after consummation of the transaction).  The transaction for which consent from the Landlord is not required pursuant to this paragraph shall be referred to as a "Permitted Transfer."
 
If at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a name change, reformation or reorganization of the Tenant entity, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord documenting such name change, reformation or reorganization.  If, at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a transfer of a controlling interest in the stock, membership or general partnership interests of Tenant, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and (whether or not Tenant so notifies Landlord) such a transfer will be deemed an assignment subject to the provisions of this Section 6.2.1. The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not be applicable as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.
 
  Not to injure, deface or otherwise harm the Premises; nor commit any nuisance; nor permit in the Premises any vending machine (except such as is used for the sale of merchandise to employees of Tenant) or inflammable fluids or chemicals (except such as are customarily used in connection with standard office equipment); nor permit any cooking to such extent as requires special exhaust venting; nor permit the emission of any objectionable noise or odor; nor make, allow or suffer any waste; nor make any use of the Premises which is improper, offensive or contrary to any law or ordinance or which will invalidate any of Landlord's insurance; nor conduct any auction, fire, "going out of business" or bankruptcy sales.

Nuisance.
 
  Except for customary office and cleaning supplies (which shall be handled in compliance with all applicable laws), not to dispose of any hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil on the Premises or the Property, or into any of the plumbing, sewage, or drainage systems thereon, and to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from all claims, liability, loss or damage arising on account of the use or disposal of hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil, including, without limitation, liability under any federal, state, or local laws, requirements and regulations, or damage to any of the aforesaid systems.

governmental reporting requirements with respect to hazardous wastes, hazardous materials and oil, and shall deliver to Landlord copies of all reports filed with governmental authorities. The preceding indemnification shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
 
  Not to place a load upon any floor of the Premises exceeding the floor load per square foot area which such floor was designed to carry and which is allowed by law.  Landlord reserves the right to prescribe the weight and position of all heavy business machines and equipment, including safes, which shall be placed so as to distribute the weight.  Business machines and mechanical equipment which cause vibration or noise shall be placed and maintained by Tenant at Tenant's expense in settings sufficient to absorb and prevent vibration, noise and annoyance.  Tenant shall not move any safe, heavy machinery, heavy equipment, freight or fixtures into or out of the Premises except in such manner and at such time as Landlord shall in each instance authorize.

Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent and approval within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant, without the prior consent of Landlord, may make nonstructural, interior alterations or installations at a cost not to exceed $1.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises per alteration/installation project (and then only up to $3.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises in any 12-month period), only if such alterations or installations do not adversely affect the structural integrity of the Building, impact the Building systems, involve penetration of the roof or exterior walls. In addition, Tenant may, without Landlord's prior consent, paint and carpet interior areas of the Premises that are not visible from outside the Premises.  In any instance where Tenant is permitted to make an installation or alteration without Landlord's prior consent, then Tenant shall, at the time of making such installation or alteration, request in writing if such installation or alteration must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord so designates such installation or alteration for removal, then Tenant shall remove the same in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1.9 above.  If Tenant fails to make such request, then Landlord shall have the option to require Tenant to remove such installation or alteration at the end of the Term.
6.2.5
                       
Installation, Alterations or Additions.
 
B.  Tenant agrees to employ for any work one or more responsible contractors of whom Landlord has given prior approval, and whose labor will work without interference with other labor working on the Property, and to cause such contractors employed by Tenant to carry worker's compensation insurance in accordance with statutory requirements and comprehensive public liability insurance covering such contractors on or about the Premises in amounts at least equal to the limits set forth in Section 1.1 and to submit certificates evidencing such coverage to Landlord prior to the commencement of such work.  Tenant shall pay promptly when due the entire cost of any work to the Premises undertaken by Tenant so that the Premises shall at all times be free of liens for labor and materials, and at Landlord's request (which shall be made reasonably in light of the scope and cost of the proposed work, among other factors) Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a bond or other security acceptable to Landlord assuring that any work commenced by Tenant will be completed in accordance with the plans and specifications theretofore approved by Landlord and assuring that the Premises will remain free of any mechanics' lien or other encumbrance arising out of such work.  In any event, Tenant shall, within ten days after the institution of such liens or encumbrances, bond against or discharge any mechanics' liens or other encumbrances that may arise out of such work.  Tenant shall procure all necessary licenses and permits at Tenant's sole expense before undertaking such work.

Such election, which may be made notwithstanding the fact that Landlord's entire interest may have been divested, shall be made by the giving of notice by Landlord to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the date of the taking or casualty.  In the event that the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or casualty, or if there is a taking of a material part of the Premises or Building, and in either case, in the reasonable opinion of an independent architect or engineer selected by Landlord, cannot be repaired or restored within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the date of such event, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Landlord or Tenant, which election shall be made by the giving of notice to the other party within thirty (30) days after the date the opinion of the architect or engineer is made available to the parties.  If any taking affecting the parking area serving the Building reduces the number of parking spaces afforded Tenant pursuant to Section 2.1, by more than twenty-five (25%) percent, and if Landlord does not provide Tenant with permanent substitute parking elsewhere in the Park within ninety (90) days of the taking, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Tenant by written notice to Landlord within twenty (20) days after at the expiration of such 90-day period.  In addition, with respect to a taking or casualty occurring during the last twelve (12) months of the Term (if Tenant has declined to exercise any remaining Extension Option) which causes the Premises or the Building, or any material part thereof, to be damaged to the extent that 30% or more of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises or the Building is destroyed, then either Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease, which election shall be made within twenty (20) days after the taking or casualty and effective as of the date that is 45 days after the date of a party's written notice of its election.
7.1
                                
Termination.
 
  If neither Landlord nor Tenant elects to so terminate, this Lease shall continue in force and a just proportion of the rent reserved, according to the nature and extent of the damages sustained by the Premises, shall be suspended or abated until the Premises, or what may remain thereof, shall be put by Landlord in proper condition for use (which shall at least be the same as immediately prior to the taking or casualty), which Landlord covenants to do with reasonable diligence to the extent permitted by the net proceeds of insurance recovered, or recoverable if Landlord carried the coverage required to be carried

Restoration.
 
hereunder, or damages awarded for such taking, destruction or damage and subject to zoning and building laws or ordinances then in existence.  "Net proceeds of insurance recovered or damages awarded" refers to the gross amount of such insurance or damages less the reasonable expenses of Landlord incurred in connection with the collection of the same, including without limitation, fees and expenses for legal and appraisal services.
 
  Irrespective of the form in which recovery may be had by law, all rights to damages or compensation shall belong to Landlord in all cases, except for awards made for Tenant's moving expenses and equipment and trade fixtures.  Except for such awards, Tenant hereby grants to Landlord all of Tenant's rights to such damages and covenants to deliver such further assignments thereof as Landlord may from time to time request.

ARTICLE 8
Defaults
 
  (a)  If Tenant shall default in the performance of any of its obligations to pay the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum due Landlord hereunder and if such default shall continue for ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord designating such default or if within thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant specifying any other default or defaults Tenant has not commenced diligently to correct the default or defaults so specified or has not thereafter diligently pursued such correction to completion, or (b)  if any assignment shall be made by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for the benefit of creditors, or (c)  if Tenant's leasehold interest shall be taken on execution, or (d)  if a lien or other involuntary encumbrance is filed against Tenant's leasehold interest or Tenant's other property, including said leasehold interest, and is not discharged within  fifteen (15) days thereafter, or (e)  if a petition is filed by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for liquidation, or for reorganization or an arrangement under any provision of any bankruptcy law or code as then in force and effect, or (f)  if an involuntary petition under any of the provisions of any bankruptcy law or code is filed against Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant and such involuntary petition is not dismissed within  ninety (90) days thereafter, then, and in any of such cases, Landlord and the agents and servants of Landlord lawfully may, in addition to and not in derogation of any remedies for any preceding breach of covenant, immediately or at any time thereafter without demand or notice and with or without process of law (forcibly, if necessary) enter into and upon the Premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole or mail a notice of termination addressed to Tenant, and repossess the same as of landlord's former estate and expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant and remove its and their effects (forcibly,  if necessary) without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies which might otherwise be used for arrears of rent or prior breach of covenants, and upon such entry or mailing as aforesaid this Lease shall terminate, Tenant hereby waiving all statutory rights to the Premises (including without limitation rights of redemption, if any, to the extent such rights may be lawfully waived) and Landlord, without notice to Tenant, may store Tenant's effects, and those of any person claiming through or under Tenant, at the expense and risk of Tenant, and, if Landlord so elects, may sell such effects at public auction or private sale and apply the net proceeds to the payment of all sums due to Landlord from Tenant, if any, and pay over the balance, if any, to Tenant.
8.1
                                
Events of Default.
 
 In the event that this Lease is terminated under any of the provisions contained in Section 8.1 or shall be otherwise terminated for breach of any obligation of Tenant, Tenant covenants to pay punctually to Landlord all the sums and to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated.  In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the next preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with any amount paid to Landlord as compensation as in this Section 8.2 provided and also with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises, after deducting all Landlord's expense in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord may (i)  relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same and (ii)  make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same, and no action of Landlord in accordance with the foregoing or failure to relet or to collect rent under reletting shall operate or be construed to release or reduce Tenant's liability as aforesaid.
8.2
                                
Remedies.
 
In lieu of full recovery by Landlord of the sums payable under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 (except for the amount of any rent of any kind accrued and unpaid at the time of termination) Landlord may by written notice to Tenant, elect to recover, and Tenant shall thereupon pay forthwith to Landlord, as compensation, the discounted present value (calculated using a discount factor equal to the then "Prime Rate" as is used by the Bank of America or its successor) of the excess of the total rent reserved for the residue of the term over the rental value of the Premises for said residue of the term.  In calculating the rent reserved there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value of all other considerations agreed to be paid or performed by Tenant for said residue.
 
Nothing contained in this Lease shall, however, limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove for and obtain in proceedings for bankruptcy or insolvency by reason of the termination of this Lease, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.
 
  Any and all rights and remedies which Landlord may have under this Lease, and at law and equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at the same time insofar as permitted by law.
8.3
                                
Remedies Cumulative.
 
 Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure, at any time, without notice, any default by Tenant under this Lease; and whenever Landlord so elects, all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in curing a default shall be paid, as Additional Rent, by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with lawful interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord to the date of payment by Tenant.
8.4
                                
Landlord's Right to Cure Defaults.
 
  Any consent or permission by Landlord to any act or omission which otherwise would be a breach of any covenant or condition herein, shall not in any way be held or construed (unless expressly so declared) to operate so as to impair the continuing obligation of any covenant or condition herein, or otherwise, except as to the specific instance, operate to permit similar acts or omissions.
8.5
                                
Effect of Waivers of Default.
 
 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation.  The receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord.  No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.
8.6
                                
No Waiver, etc.
 
  No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or charge due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent or other charge be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.
8.7
                                
No Accord and Satisfaction.
 
ARTICLE 9
Rights of Mortgage Holders
 
  The word "mortgage" as used herein includes mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments evidencing other voluntary liens or encumbrances, and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof.  The word "holder" shall mean a mortgagee, and any subsequent holder or holders of a mortgage.  Until the holder of a mortgage shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have only such rights of Landlord as are necessary to preserve the integrity of this Lease as security.  Upon entry and taking possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have all the rights of Landlord.  No such holder of a mortgage shall be liable either as mortgagee or as assignee, to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure.  Upon entry for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall be liable to perform all of the obligations of Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the provisions of Section 10.4, provided that a discontinuance of any foreclosure proceeding shall be deemed a conveyance under said provisions to the owner of the equity of the Property.
9.1
                                
Rights of Mortgage Holders.
 
The covenants and agreements contained in this Lease with respect to the rights, powers and benefits of a holder of a mortgage (particularly, without limitation thereby, the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 9.1) constitute a continuing offer to any person, corporation or other entity, which by accepting a mortgage subject to this Lease, assumes the obligations herein set forth with respect to such holder; such holder is hereby constituted a party of this Lease as an obligee hereunder to the same extent as though its name were written hereon as such; and such holder shall be entitled to enforce such provisions in its own name.  Tenant agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time any agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 9.1.
 
  A.  It is agreed that the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease shall be (i)  subject or subordinate to any present or future mortgage or mortgages and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest of the holder thereof in the Premises or any property of which the Premises are a part if Landlord shall elect by notice to Tenant to subject or subordinate the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease to such mortgage or (ii)  prior to any present or future mortgage or mortgages, if Landlord shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to give the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease priority to such mortgage; in the event of either of such elections and upon notification by Landlord to that effect, the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease should be deemed to be subordinate to, or have priority over, as the case may be, said mortgage or mortgages, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any such mortgage or mortgages (provided that, in the case of subordination of this Lease to any future mortgages, the holder thereof agrees to recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease and not to disturb the possession of Tenant.  Tenant agrees it will, upon not less than fifteen (15) days' prior written request by Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all reasonably acceptable instruments deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable to give effect to or notice of
9.2
                                
Lease Superior or Subordinate to Mortgages.
 
such subordination or priority.  Tenant agrees that any future SNDA that is similar in all material respects to the form of SNDA attached hereto as Exhibit L will be deemed "reasonably acceptable". Any Mortgage to which this Lease shall be subordinated may contain such terms, provisions and conditions as the holder deems usual or customary.
 
B.            Landlord agrees to use diligent efforts to cause its current mortgagee to deliver to Tenant a "subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement" in the form attached to this Lease as Exhibit M (the "SNDA"), no later than 5 business days after full execution of this Lease.  It is agreed that it shall be an express condition precedent to the validity of this Lease that Landlord's current mortgagee provides such an SNDA to Tenant, and if such SNDA is not provided to Tenant by the aforesaid date, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord no later than 10 business days after the full execution of this Lease, effective upon the giving of such notice.
 
ARTICLE 10
Miscellaneous Provisions
 
  All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and addressed, if to the Tenant, at the Original Notice Address of Tenant or such other address as Tenant shall have last designated by notice in writing to Landlord (with a copy by similar means to Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, Attn:  Paul Jakubowski)  and, if to Landlord, at the Original Notice Address of Landlord or such other address as Landlord shall have last designated by notice in writing to Tenant.

10.1
                          
Notices from One Party to the Other.
 
 Landlord agrees that upon Tenant's paying the rent and performing and observing the agreements, conditions and other provisions on its part to be performed and observed, Tenant shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the term hereof without any manner of hindrance or molestation from Landlord or anyone claiming under Landlord, subject, however, to the terms of this Lease.
10.2
                          
Quiet Enjoyment.
 
  Each party agrees that it will not record this Lease.  Both parties shall, upon the request of either, execute and deliver a notice or short form of this Lease in such form, if any, as may be permitted by applicable statute.  Following satisfaction of the contingencies set forth in Sections 2.2.1 and 9.2B, either party may record a notice of lease in the form attached hereto as , which notice of lease shall be executed at Lease signing but held until satisfaction of such contingencies.  Tenant agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver a notice of termination of lease in Tenant's name upon its execution of this Lease which is to be held in escrow by Landlord until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
10.3
                          
Lease not to be Recorded.
Exhibit G
 
  The term "Landlord" as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations to be performed by Landlord are concerned, shall be limited to mean and include only the owner or owners at the time in question of the Property, and in the event of any transfer or transfers of title to said property, the Landlord (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then grantor) shall be concurrently freed and relieved from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance, without any further instrument or agreement of all liability as respects the performance of any covenants or obligations on the part of the Landlord contained in this Lease thereafter to be performed, it being intended hereby that the covenants and obligations contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord, shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on the Landlord, its successors and assigns, only during and in respect of their respective successive periods of ownership of said leasehold interest or fee, as the case may be.  Tenant, its successors and assigns, shall not assert nor seek to enforce any claim for breach of this Lease against any of Landlord's assets other than Landlord's interest in the Property and in the rents, issues and proceeds thereof, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such interest for the satisfaction of any liability or claim against Landlord under this Lease, it being specifically agreed that in no event whatsoever shall Landlord (which term shall include, without limitation, any general or limited partner, trustees, beneficiaries, officers, directors, or stockholders of Landlord) ever be personally liable for any such liability.
10.4
                          
Limitation of Landlord's Liability.
 
  In any case where either party hereto is required to do any act, delays caused by or resulting from Acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire, flood or other casualty, labor difficulties, shortages of labor, materials or equipment, government regulations, unusually severe weather, or other causes beyond such party's reasonable control (any of the foregoing causes being referred to herein as "Force Majeure") shall not be counted in determining the time during which work shall be completed, whether such time be designated by a fixed date, a fixed time or a "reasonable time," and such time shall be deemed to be extended by the period of such delay. No event shall constitute "Force Majeure" unless the party invoking the benefit of this Section 10.5 advises the other party of the occurrence of the alleged Force Majeure event within 5 business days after such party's awareness of the occurrence of such event.
10.5
                          
Force Majeure.
 
A.  Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder unless it shall fail to perform such obligations and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default after written notice has been given by Tenant to Landlord (with copies of such notice delivered simultaneously to all mortgagees of which Tenant has notice) specifying the nature of Landlord's alleged default. 
10.6
                          
Landlord's Default.
 
Landlord shall not be liable in any event for incidental or consequential damages to Tenant by reason of Landlord's default, whether or not notice is given.  Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any default by Landlord hereunder and no right, for any such default, to offset or counterclaim against any rent due hereunder, except as expressly provided below.
 
B.  If Landlord fails, after the expiration of the cure periods specified in Paragraph (A) above, to cure any default, Tenant may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Landlord captioned "NOTICE  SELF-HELP REMEDY TO BE INVOKED" advising Landlord that Tenant intends to exercise its self-help rights under this Section 10.6, undertake to cure any default by Landlord under this Lease relating to the Premises and/or building systems exclusively serving the Premises, provided however, that Tenant shall not have the right to cure any such default to the extent that such cure would relate to (i) areas outside of the Premises, (ii) the structure or mechanical or life safety systems of the Building or (iii) any Building systems (such as air handlers, for example) that feed into the Central Utility Plant  Whenever Tenant so elects to cure a default by Landlord as set forth herein, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's written demand (which shall include reasonably detailed supporting documentation), reimburse Tenant for all costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in curing a default; provided, however, Landlord shall only be responsible for the incremental cost in excess of the cost that would ordinarily be part of Operating Costs under this Lease, if applicable.  If Landlord fails to make any payment to Tenant as and when due, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity, Tenant shall have the right to offset such owed amounts against its payments of Fixed Rent coming due under this Lease; provided, however, that the amount of each such monthly offset shall not exceed twenty (20%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated under Section 1.1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord has undertaken curative action (which may include providing Tenant with a remedial plan and timetable for rectifying the default) and is proceeding with diligence, but has been unable to fully complete such cure by the expiration of thirty (30) days from Tenant's first notice of such default, Landlord shall be afforded a reasonable time thereafter in which to complete its curative efforts before Tenant may effect a cure.  If Tenant elects to exercise self-help under this Section 10.6, then Tenant may not avail itself of any other remedy at law or in equity.
.
 
 Each of Landlord and Tenant warrants and represents that it has dealt with no broker in connection with the consummation of this Lease, other than the Brokers, and each agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless form and against any and all loss, cost, damage, claim or expense resulting from the breach of the foregoing warranty.  Landlord shall pay the Brokers pursuant to a separate agreement.  Tenant shall have no liability for any amounts due the Brokers.

  This Lease may be executed in counterpart copies, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, if any provisions of this Lease shall to any extent be invalid, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.  This Lease and the Exhibits attached hereto and forming a part hereof constitute all the covenants, promises, agreements, and understandings between Landlord and Tenant concerning the Premises and the Building and there are no covenants, promises, agreements or understandings, either oral or written, between them other than as are set forth in this Lease.  Neither Landlord nor Landlord's agents shall be bound to any representations with respect to the Premises, the Building or the Property except as herein expressly set forth, and all representations, either oral or written, shall be deemed to be merged into this Lease. Each of Landlord and Tenant shall and does hereby waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or claim regarding any matter arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant or Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises.  The titles of the several Articles and Sections contained herein are for convenience only and shall not be considered in construing this Lease.  Unless repugnant to the context, the words "Landlord" and "Tenant" appearing in this Lease shall be construed to mean those named above and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and those claiming through or under them respectively.  If there be more than one tenant, the obligations imposed by this Lease upon Tenant shall be joint and several.

Limitations
.

From and after any such attornment, Agent or such purchaser shall be bound to Tenant under all the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall, from and after such attornment to Agent, or to such purchaser, have the same remedies against Agent, or such purchaser, for the breach of an agreement contained in the Lease that Tenant might have had under the Lease against Landlord, if Agent or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord.  , , that Agent or such purchaser shall only be bound during the period of its ownership, and that in the case of the exercise by Agent of its rights under the Mortgage, or the Assignment, or any combination thereof, or a foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, Agent's liability under the Lease shall be limited to, and all Tenant claims shall be satisfied only out of, the interest, if any, of Agent, or such purchaser, in the Property, and Agent and such purchaser shall not be (a) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including the Landlord); or (b) liable for or incur any obligation with respect to the construction of the Property or any improvements of the Premises or the Property; or (c) liable for or subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against any prior landlord (including the Landlord), except and only to the extent such offset or defense does not relate to monetary damages accruing as a result of any acts or omissions occurring before the period of Agent's, or any such purchaser's, ownership; , that this limitation does not limit Tenant's exercise of its rights to offset or defense under law and/or as expressly provided in the Lease; or (d) bound by any rent or additional rent which Tenant might have paid for more than the then current rental period to any prior landlord (including the Landlord); or (e) bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease that is made without Agent's prior written consent; or (f) bound by any assignment of the Lease or any encumbrance of Tenant's interest thereunder or any sublet thereunder (except if expressly permitted without Landlord's consent under the terms of the Lease) that is made without Agent's prior written consent; or (g) bound by or responsible for any security deposit not actually received by Agent; or (h) liable for or incur any obligation with respect to any breach of warranties or representations of any nature under the Lease or otherwise including without limitation any warranties or representations respecting use, compliance with zoning, landlord's title, landlord's authority, habitability and/or fitness for any purpose, or possession; or (i) liable for consequential damages.  The foregoing shall not, however:  (i) relieve Agent or such purchaser, of the obligation to remedy or cure any conditions at the Premises the existence of which constitutes a Landlord default under the Lease and which continue at the time of such succession or acquisition, provided, however, that Agent shall in no event be liable for actual damages caused by such conditions; or (ii) deprive the Tenant of the right to terminate the Lease for a breach of Landlord covenant which is not cured as provided for herein and in the Lease and as a result of which there is a material interference with Tenant's permitted use and occupation of the Premises or any permitted business conducted therein; or (iii) deprive Tenant of accrued but unapplied rent offset rights, as set forth in the Lease, relating to periods prior to Agent's or purchaser's succession to the interest of Borrower as Landlord.

Exhibits.
 
The Exhibits listed below in this section are incorporated in this Lease by reference and are to be construed as a part of this Lease.
 
 
ARTICLE 2 Premises and Term
 
  Landlord hereby leases the Premises to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases the Premises from Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease.  Excluded from the Premises are the roof and the exterior surfaces of the exterior walls of the Building.  Tenant shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, rights to use in common, subject to reasonable rules of general applicability to tenants of the Park from time to time made by Landlord of which Tenant is given notice:  (a)  common walkways, roadways, and driveways necessary for access and egress to the Building and the Property, and (b) the common parking areas serving the Building.  There are currently 82 parking spaces in the parking area serving the Building, which Tenant shall be permitted to use, exclusively, provided, however, that Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to reconfigure the layout of some or all of the parking area serving the Building as long as the parking area remains in the same approximate vicinity around the Building as exists as of the Date of this Lease, and provided, further, such reconfiguration will not result in a net loss of the parking area as existed prior to such reconfiguration.  Landlord shall have no obligation to police the use of the parking area.  In no event will Landlord impact the functionality of the Building loading dock or the associated access driveways serving it in any exercise of its right under this paragraph.
2.1
                                
Premises.
 
Landlord reserves the right from time to time, without unreasonable interference with use of the Premises:  (a) to make any repairs and replacements to the Premises which Landlord may deem necessary, and (b) in connection with any excavation made upon adjacent land of Landlord or others, to enter, and to license others to enter, upon the Premises to do such work as the person causing such excavation deems necessary to preserve the wall of the Building from injury or damage and to support the same.  In exercising such rights, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize inconvenience to Tenant's operations in the Premises.
 
  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for the Original Term, which shall begin on the Commencement Date,  and end on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided.  The term "Substantially Completed" as used herein shall mean that the work to be performed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit C and the Final Plans (defined below) has been completed with the exception of minor items which can be fully completed without material interference with Tenant and other items which because of the season or weather or the nature of the item are not practicable to do at the time, provided that none of said items is necessary to make the Premises tenantable for the Permitted Uses, that the Premises are delivered to Tenant broom clean and free of prior tenants and occupants and their personal property, and a Certificate of Occupancy (which may be a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, provided that Landlord uses diligence to obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy within a reasonable time) has been issued by the Town of Burlington and all other requirements of "Substantial Completion" set forth in Section 3.6 have been completed. However, if Landlord cannot obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy by the Target Commencement Date because of a Tenant Delay (defined in Section 3.1.B), then the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have occurred and the Landlord's Work deemed to be "Substantially Completed" on the date that such work would have been Substantially Completed but for such Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work (defined in Section 3.2 below) and obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy).  When the Commencement Date, the Expiration Date, the Rent Commencement Dates, the beginning and end of the 1st Lease Year have been determined, as well as the notice dates for exercising the Extension Option and the Termination Option, such dates shall be evidenced by a document, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and executed by Landlord and Tenant.  If Landlord's Work in the Premises is Substantially Completed prior to completion of the other Avid Spaces, and Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business nonetheless, then the Commencement Date for the Premises under this Lease will be deemed to have occurred as of the date of Tenant's occupancy.  In that event, the first Lease Year under this Lease shall be extended by the number of days necessary to make the last day of such first Lease Year the same as the last day of the first lease year under the Building 75 Lease or the Building 65 Lease, whichever lease has a first lease year expiring latest.
2.2
                                
Term.
 
The term "Lease Year" as used herein shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive full calendar months.  The first Lease Year shall begin on the Commencement Date if the Commencement Date is the first day of a calendar month; if not, then the first Lease Year shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the Commencement Date occurs.  Each succeeding Lease Year shall commence upon the anniversary date of the first Lease Year.
 
  Reference is made to the fact that Wing B of the Building 75 Premises is currently leased to and occupied by Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") pursuant to a lease dated June 27, 2007 (the "Sun Lease"), between Landlord's affiliate, the Building 75 Landlord and Sun for premises in certain buildings in the adjacent park known as Network Drive at Northwest Park, including Wing B of Building 75.

The Building 75 Landlord, the Building 65 Landlord, and Tenant now desire that Sun accelerate the surrender date to January 31, 2010.  Therefore, it is an express condition precedent to this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease that Sun shall agree to an earlier termination and surrender of Wing B of
2.2.1
                    
Condition Precedent.
 
Building 75 and execute a letter agreement to that effect (the "Sun Letter Agreement"). Landlord shall cause the Building 75 Landlord to use diligent efforts to obtain the Sun Letter Agreement as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the Sun Letter Agreement is not executed by the Building 75 Landlord and Sun and a copy delivered to Tenant by the date that is ten (10) days after the full execution of this Lease, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease by giving Landlord written notice of termination any time after the expiration of such 10-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement.  If Tenant gives such notice, then this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease shall be terminated immediately as of the date of Tenant's notice.  If Tenant has not elected to so terminate the leases, and the Building 75 Landlord, despite having used diligent efforts, has not obtained a fully executed Sun Letter Agreement by the date that is 30 days after full execution of this Lease, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease, the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease by giving Tenant written notice of termination at any time after the expiration of such 30-day period, but prior to and until such time that Landlord delivers the executed Sun Letter Agreement, such termination to be effective immediately as of the date of the notice.  If this Lease and the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease are terminated by either party, no documentation other than a party's notice of termination shall be required to effectuate such termination, and neither party shall have any liability to the other on account of termination.
 
  A.  Tenant shall have two options (each, an "Extension Option") to extend the term of this Lease, each for an additional period of five (5) years.  The first such fiveyear period (the "First Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, and the second such five-year period (the "Second Extended Term") shall begin immediately upon the expiration of the First Extended Term, provided that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:
2.3
                                
Extension Option.
 
As of the date of an Extension Notice (defined below) and as of the commencement of the First Extended Term and, if applicable, the Second Extended Term, Tenant has not been in default of its monetary obligations beyond the expiration of any applicable cure periods under this Lease more than two times during the Term, including any Extended Term; and
(i)
                                    
 
Tenant has not subleased 20% or more of the rentable square footage of the Premises, both at the time of the Extension Notice and as of the commencement of the First Extended Term and, if applicable, the Second Extended Term.
(ii)
          
 
B.            All of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease shall apply to each Extended Term except that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for each such Extended Term shall be the then- fair market rental rate for premises of comparable size and quality to the Premises, in comparable buildings in the competitive market area as of the commencement of the applicable Extended Term, (the "Fair Market Rate"), but in no event less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the immediately preceding term of this Lease (i.e., during the Original Term and during the First Extended Term, as applicable).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate during the First Extended Term shall be no less than $9.53 per rentable square foot of Premises (i.e., the average rental rate per rentable square foot of Premises during the Original Term), and during the Second Extended Term, the Annual Fixed Rent Rate shall be no less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the First Extended Term.  If Tenant shall elect to exercise an Extension Option, it shall do so by giving Landlord written notice (the "Extension Notice") of its election not later than fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term of this Lease, or fifteen (15) months prior to the expiration of the First Extended Term, as the case may be.  If Tenant gives such notice and satisfies the conditions specified above, the extension of this Lease shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional documents, but the parties subsequently shall enter into a lease amendment as contemplated under Section 2.3.F below.  The Original Term and each Extended Term are hereinafter collectively sometimes called the "Term" or the "term".
 
C.            Not later than fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term or the First Extended Term, as applicable, Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rate for the applicable Extended Term.  Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord gives Tenant Landlord's proposal for Fair Market Rate, Tenant shall notify Landlord whether Tenant accepts or disputes such rate.  If Tenant disagrees with Landlord's designation, Landlord and Tenant shall commence negotiations to agree upon the Fair Market Rate.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on the Fair Market Rate within thirty (30) days after the date on which Landlord first gave Tenant Landlord's proposal for the Fair Market Rate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be determined as provided below.
 
D.            If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the Fair Market Rate by the end of said thirty (30)-day period, then within five (5) days thereafter, Landlord and Tenant shall each simultaneously submit to the other in a sealed envelope its good faith estimate of the Fair Market Rate, including anticipated steps in rent, if any.  If the higher of such estimates is not more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the other estimate, then the Fair Market Rate shall be the average of the two estimates. If the matter is not resolved by the exchange of estimates, then Fair Market Rate shall be determined by an independent arbitrator as set forth below.
 
E.             Within seven (7) days after the exchange of estimates, the parties shall select, as an arbitrator, a mutually acceptable commercial real estate broker or appraiser licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts specializing in the field of commercial office leasing in the suburban Boston area, having no
 
less than ten (10) years' experience (an "Approved Arbitrator").  If the parties cannot agree on such person, then within a second period of seven (7) days, each shall select one Approved Arbitrator and the two appointed Arbitrators shall, within five (5) days, select a third Approved Arbitrator who shall be the final decision-maker (the "Final Arbitrator").  If one party shall fail to timely make such appointment, then the person chosen by the other party shall be the sole arbitrator. Once the Final Arbitrator has been selected as provided for above, then, as soon thereafter as practicable, but in any case within fourteen (14) days after his or her appointment, the arbitrator shall determine the Fair Market Rate by selecting either the Landlord's estimate of Fair Market Rate or the Tenant's estimate of Fair Market Rate.  Such arbitrator must choose the proposed Fair Market Rate that he/she determines is closest to the actual market rental rate for the Premises , taking into account that the Annual Fixed Rent Rate must in no event be less than the average Annual Fixed Rent Rate in effect during the immediately preceding term, as specifically set forth in Section 2.3(B).  There shall be no discovery or similar proceedings. The arbitrator's decision as to which estimate shall be the Fair Market Rate for the Extended Term shall be rendered in writing to both Landlord and Tenant and shall be final and binding upon them and shall be the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for the Extended Term.  The costs of the Final Arbitrator will be equally divided between Landlord and Tenant.  Any fees of any counsel engaged by Landlord or Tenant, however, shall be borne by the party that retained such counsel.
 
F.             Once the Fair Market Rate has been determined, the parties shall promptly execute an amendment to this Lease setting  forth the Fixed Rent for the Premises during the applicable Extended Term.  For any part of the Extended Term during which the Fixed Rent Rate is in dispute, or has not yet been finally determined, Tenant shall make payments to Landlord on account of Fixed Rent at the rate per square foot of Rentable Floor Area of the Premises last paid under this Lease.  The parties shall adjust for any overpayments or underpayments upon final determination of such rent.
 
  Provided that as of the date of the notice specified below and as of the Effective Termination Date (hereinafter defined), Tenant is not in default of its obligations beyond any applicable grace period under this Lease, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease effective as of the last day of the fifth (5) Lease Year (such date the "Effective Termination Date").  If Tenant shall elect to exercise such right, it shall do so by giving written notice to Landlord no later than twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Termination Date, such notice to be accompanied by a payment of the Termination Payment.  As used herein, the term "Termination Payment" shall mean the sum of: (a) the unamortized cost of Landlord's Work, (b) Landlord's unamortized transaction costs incurred in connection with this Lease (including legal fees and real estate commissions).  The Termination Payment shall be as set forth on , attached hereto.  It is agreed that time is of the essence of this Section 2.4.  Accordingly, if Tenant fails timely to exercise its right to terminate the Lease on or before the applicable exercise date specified above, and/or timely make the payments set forth herein, then Tenant shall have no further right to terminate this Lease hereunder.  This Termination Option is personal to Avid Technology, Inc. and may not be assigned except in accordance with Section 6.2.1.

Exhibit B-1
 
 
  A. Landlord shall , at its sole cost, insure that all restrooms and access/egress ways are in compliance with applicable building codes, including those requiring removal of architectural barriers to disabled persons (all of the foregoing is called, the "Base Building Work").  All Landlord's Base Building Work shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner employing building standard materials and finishes.
3.1
                                
Base Building Condition; Tenant Improvement Work.
 
B.            Landlord shall cause to be performed the alterations and improvements desired by Tenant to prepare the Premises for Tenant's use (the "TIW") substantially in accordance with the Schematic Design Plans attached hereto as Exhibit C and pursuant to the Final Plans.  Landlord shall also cause a loading dock to be constructed as part of the TIW, substantially in accordance with the preliminary plan attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 and the Final Plans.  The TIW will be performed at Landlord's expense up to the TI Allowance and subject to payment by Tenant of the Tenant's Share (defined in Section 3.4). The TI Allowance may be applied at Tenant's discretion toward architectural and engineering fees, the construction management fee to Nordblom Development Company (referred to below), consulting fees, hard construction costs, air-conditioning and special electrical power distribution, telephone and security systems and the cost of furniture, fixtures or equipment.  All Base Building Work and the TIW (collectively, the "Landlord's Work") shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable building laws.  Tenant agrees that Landlord may make any non-material changes in the Landlord's Work which may become reasonably necessary or advisable to accommodate field conditions or to substitute materials of equal or better quality to meet availability schedules, without approval of Tenant, provided written notice is promptly given to Tenant; and Landlord may make other changes in such work reasonably necessary to accommodate unforeseen conditions, with the written approval of Tenant, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Landlord shall use diligence to cause Landlord's Work to be Substantially Completed by the Target Commencement Date, subject to Force Majeure events (defined in Section 10.5 hereof) and any Tenant Delay (defined below).  Tenant shall be required to pay to Nordblom Development Company a project management fee equal to 1.5% of the total construction cost of the TIW, excluding project management costs, costs for architectural and engineering fees, moving costs and telecommunications wiring and cabling costs.
 
C.            The phrase, "Tenant Delay", shall be defined as any delay in the completion of Landlord's Work actually caused by (i) special work, upgrades or long lead-time items for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay, and in either instance Tenant does not withdraw or alter such special work, upgrade, long lead-time item which avoids such delay, (ii) any changes to any plans, including the Final Plans, made by Tenant, or any Tenant's Change Order, in any case for which Landlord identifies a specified period of delay at the time of its approval and for which Tenant does not withdraw such change to avoid delay, (iii) any change in the design of the TIW or any component thereof made by Tenant that results in a delay in the Landlord's construction start date beyond January 3, 2010, (iv) the delay of Tenant or its architects and engineers in providing or approving the Construction Plans or the Proposed GMP, or supplying, submitting or approving any other plans, specifications, pricing or estimates or giving authorizations or supplying information reasonably required by Landlord or its General Contractor or the Town of Burlington by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1, and in this Article 3, or in any other instance if no time period is specified, then within three (3) business days after request therefor, (v) any failure by any contractors employed by Tenant including, without limitation, contractors furnishing telecommunications, data processing or other service or equipment directly to Tenant (and not via Landlord's contractors) to comply with the agreed upon timetables for coordination of the parties' respective components of work, as established at on-site progress meetings between Landlord's representative and Tenant's representative, each acting reasonably and in good faith, (vi) any failure to comply with this Article 3 or any material interference with the performance of Landlord's Work by Tenant or any of its agents, employees, architects, engineers or contractors, or (vii) Tenant's delay in delivering the Original Letter of Credit required pursuant to Section 4.4. No event shall constitute a "Tenant Delay" unless Landlord advises Tenant in writing (which may be by email with a copy to Paul.Jakubowski@WilmerHale.com) of such event within three (3) business days after Landlord becomes aware of its occurrence; however, Landlord need not give Tenant notice of any failure of Tenant to act by the dates stipulated in Section 1.1 and in this Article 3, it being acknowledged that a failure to timely act by such stipulated dates is a "Tenant Delay" on a day for day basis.
ipso facto
 
A.  In the event that Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by July 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent first coming due as of the Rent Commencement Date shall be abated by one day for each day of delay during the period beginning on July 1, 2010, and ending on the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  If Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by August 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 2 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on August 1, 2010, and continuing until the day the Landlord's Work is in fact Substantially Complete.  Further, if the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by September 1, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event,  then the Fixed Rent shall be further abated by 3 days for each day of delay during the period beginning on September 1, 2010 and continuing until the day Landlord's Work is Substantially Complete.

Late Delivery.
 
B.            If the Landlord's Work is not Substantially Complete by October 31, 2010, for any reason other than a Tenant Delay or Force Majeure event, then Tenant may elect to perform the incomplete Landlord's Work, itself, utilizing the funds held under the Construction Escrow Agreement for any incomplete TIW, with any reasonable expenditures for the Base Building Work to be reimbursed by Landlord within 30 days after request therefore with back-up documentation to substantiate the request, failing which, Tenant shall have the right to offset such expenditures against the Fixed Rent coming due as of the Rent Commencement Date, except that such monthly offset shall not exceed fifteen (15%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated in Section 1.1.
 
C.            If the Landlord's Work is still not Substantially Complete by May 31, 2011, despite Landlord having used diligent efforts to complete the Landlord's Work, and provided the reason for Landlord's inability to complete such work by May 31, 2011 is not due solely to Tenant Delay, then either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to the other party.  If either party timely and properly gives the termination notice, then this Lease shall terminate immediately upon the date of a party's notice.
 
  A. Tenant shall be solely responsible for the preparation and submission to Landlord of (a) the Schematic Design Plans, (b) a full set of architectural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing, construction, design development drawings, including demolition plans sufficient for pricing and permitting equivalent in design completion to more than 50% of the TIW Plans (the "Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans"), and (c) a full CD set of architectural and MEP construction plans and specifications sufficient to permit and construct the TIW (called "TIW Plans"), and all other information reasonably required by Landlord and the General Contractor (defined below) necessary obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington and otherwise to perform and complete the TIW.  All plans shall emanate from and be consistent with the approved Schematic Design Plan attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Tenant has assured itself by direct communication with the architect and engineers that the Design Development/Permitting/Pricing Plans can be submitted to Landlord by the respective dates set forth in Section 1.1.  Additionally, Tenant agrees to cause the TIW Plans to be delivered to Landlord for review before the Final Plans Date and agrees to devote such time as may be necessary in consultation with said architect and engineers to enable them to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.  Tenant shall cause its architect and engineers to cooperate with Landlord and the General Contractor, as reasonably necessary to enable Landlord to obtain a building permit from the Town of Burlington for the TIW by January 2, 2010.  Tenant shall also cause its architects and engineers to reasonably cooperate with Landlord or the General Contractor, as applicable, as reasonably necessary to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy from the Town of Burlington. Time is of the essence in respect of the preparation and submission of all plans by
3.3
                                
Plans and Specifications
 
Tenant.  If in Landlord's judgment, Tenant's architects and engineers are not cooperating fully or progressing diligently, then Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to engage its own architects and engineers to complete any necessary plans and to supply information, and the like to obtain a building permit by January 2, 2010, or to meet construction schedules and to otherwise avoid delay, but such right to take action on Tenant's behalf to speed the approval process shall not entitle Landlord to make material changes to the Final Plans (defined in paragraph B below); provided, however, if the Town of Burlington requires any change to the Final Plans in order to issue a building permit, Tenant shall reasonably cooperate with Landlord to address the Town's concerns and requests.  The fees of any architect and engineer engaged by Landlord pursuant to the preceding sentence will be paid by Tenant within thirty (30) days after invoice from Landlord.
 
B.            All plans shall require Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.  Landlord shall give Tenant notice, in reasonable detail, of any reasonable objections or concerns Landlord may have with respect to any plans or revised plan, within ten (10) business days after submission by Tenant of its plans and all necessary supporting information.  Landlord shall not be deemed unreasonable for withholding or conditioning approval of plans which (i) involve or are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect any structural element or exterior element of the Building or any portion thereof; provided however, that notwithstanding this provision Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, delay, or condition it approval of changes to the exterior loading dock described in Section 3.1 and which changes are reasonably consistent with Exhibit C-1, or (ii) are reasonably likely, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, to materially adversely affect the value of the Building or any portion thereof, or (iii) are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the proper functioning of the Building systems.  If Landlord objects to any plans, or any portion thereof,  Tenant shall cause the plans to be revised in a manner sufficient to remedy Landlord's objections and respond to Landlord's concerns and redelivered to Landlord within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice of objection.  The aforesaid process shall be repeated until the plans are approved by Landlord.  The final TIW Plans approved by Landlord shall be called the "Final Plans" and will be used to obtain a building permit for the TIW.  Tenant shall use diligence to submit the TIW Plans and any revisions in order to complete the Final Plans by the Final Plans Date.
 
 Landlord shall cause the TIW to be performed by Erland Construction (the "General Contractor") and by major subcontractors (which shall be re-insured) selected and engaged by Landlord and the General Contractor, and approved by Tenant, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to reasonably bid each major trade of subcontractor work involved in the TIW, and shall cause the General Contractor to accept the lowest qualified bid submitted for each such trade unless such bid fails to conform to the Final Plans or if Landlord, Tenant and General Contractor reasonably agree otherwise.  Landlord shall provide Tenant with periodic pricing once Landlord receives the Schematic Design Plans.  Within 14  days after receipt of the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to provide Tenant a proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price (the "Proposed GMP") for the TIW.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the Proposed GMP Tenant shall either give Landlord its written approval of the Proposed GMP, or shall cause the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans to be value engineered and revised by means of a "deductive alternative" process for budget control rather than a redesign effort.  The revised Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, shall be subject to Landlord's approval and shall be submitted by Landlord to General Contractor for revised pricing.  The foregoing process shall be repeated utilizing TIW Plans, if necessary, until the Proposed GMP is approved by Tenant in writing.  Tenant agrees to cause its architects and engineers to use diligence to revise the plans as necessary to achieve an approved GMP no later than December 30, 2009 (as approved, the "Contract Price").  It is expressly understood that any delay by Tenant in approving the GMP by December 30, 2009, will constitute a Tenant Delay on a day-for-day basis for each day from December 30, 2009 until the date the GMP is finally approved by Tenant, and if such period of Tenant Delay actually delays Landlord in achieving Substantial Completion of Landlord's Work by June 1, 2010, then Landlord shall have the right to deem the Commencement Date to have occurred on the date that such Landlord's Work would have been Substantially Completed but for such period of Tenant Delay (but Landlord shall not be relieved of the obligation to actually complete Landlord's Work and obtain a permanent certificate of occupancy). Promptly after approval of the Contract Price and receipt of the Final Plans, Landlord shall release the General Contractor to perform the TIW in accordance with the Final Plans at Landlord's cost, subject to payment by Tenant of the amount (the "Tenant's Share") by which the Contract Price (subject to adjustment pursuant to the next paragraph) exceeds the TI Allowance.
3.4
                                
Cost of TIW; Tenant's Share.
Subguard
 
Landlord and Tenant have entered into the Construction Escrow Agreement to ensure that funds will be available to pay for the TIW.  Within 21 days after the full execution of this Lease Landlord shall fund $604,160.00 into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established pursuant to the terms of the Construction Escrow Agreement, and Tenant shall fund into the Escrow Account the Tenant's Share (adjusted pursuant to the Construction Escrow Agreement once Tenant's Share is finally determined).  In the event either Landlord or Tenant fails to fully fund its share into the Escrow Account within the aforesaid 21-day period, then the other party may elect to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to the other, effective immediately upon the giving of the notice.
 
After the TIW has been completed, if it is determined that the total payments under the contract with the General Contractor were actually less than the Contract Price, the savings shall be refunded to Tenant, as more specifically set forth in the Construction Escrow Agreement.
 
  After the Final Plans and the Contract Price have been approved, Tenant may elect
3.5
                                
Work Change Orders.
 
changes to the Final Plans  ("Tenant's Change Order"). Tenant shall submit each proposed Tenant's Change Order to Landlord for its approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided Tenant's requested change will not affect the compliance of the Building or the Premises with applicable laws.  Landlord agrees to respond to any Tenant's Change Order within such time as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances (taking into consideration the information contained in such Change Order), and in any event no later than five (5) business days following submission by Tenant, advising Tenant of any anticipated increase in costs associated with such Tenant Change Order as well as an estimate of any delay in Landlord's Work (it being understood that a delay, if any, in Landlord's Work caused by such Change Order could result in a deemed Commencement Date pursuant to Section 2.1).  Tenant shall then have the right to approve or withdraw such Tenant's Change Order.  If any Tenant's Change Order is approved as aforesaid, and the applicable Tenant Change Order increases the cost of construction, then before implementing any such change, Landlord will prepare a Work Change Order Form, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, setting forth any adjustment in the Contract Price.  To be valid, the Work Change Order Form must be signed by both parties.  Landlord will maintain an accurate log of all Tenant's Change Orders and will invoice Tenant monthly for the cost of each Tenant Change Order.  Tenant will be required to pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt, except for any Tenant's Change Order of $20,000.00 or more, in which case Tenant will deposit into the Escrow Account under the Construction Escrow Agreement the cost of such Tenant's Change Order upon signing the Work Change Order Form.  Landlord shall have no obligation to proceed with any Tenant's Change Order until payment is received or made as aforesaid.
to propose
 
Tenant or its representatives may, at reasonable times, enter upon the Premises during the progress of the work to inspect the progress thereof and to determine if the work is being performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.1. Tenant shall promptly give to Landlord notices of any alleged failure by Landlord to comply with those requirements.  Landlord's Work shall be deemed approved by Tenant when Tenant occupies the Premises for the conduct of its business, except for items of Landlord's Work which are uncompleted or do not conform to Exhibit C and the Final Plans and as to which Tenant shall, in either case, have given written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the Commencement Date as set forth in a punch-list as set forth below.  A certificate of completion by Landlord's architect or engineer and a Certificate of Occupancy shall be evidence that Landlord's Work has been completed except for items stated in such certificate to be incomplete or not in conformity with Exhibit C and the Final Plans.  Within five (5) days after the Town of Burlington issues a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, Landlord and Tenant shall meet for the purpose of determining the work remaining in order for Landlord to achieve a final Certificate of Occupancy, each acting reasonably and in good faith, and to select a subsequent date for a joint walk-through of the Premises in order to prepare a punch-list identifying items of Landlord's Work which are incomplete (the "Punch-list Items").  Landlord shall cause such Punch-list Items to be completed within thirty (30) days after the preparation of the list by the parties, unless the parties agree upon any longer time periods. If Tenant notifies Landlord in writing of the existence of a latent defect in Landlord's Work within one year following the Commencement Date, then Landlord at its expense subject to its General Contractor's warranty will repair such defect.  A "latent defect" is a defect in the construction of the Premises which defect would not ordinarily be observed during a walk-through inspection.
3.6
                                
Acceptance of the Premises.
 
  With Landlord's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Tenant and its agents and architects shall have the right to enter the Premises after full execution and delivery of this Lease during customary business hours and without payment of rent, but otherwise subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, to facilitate Tenant's preparation of its plans for the TIW so long as such work does not interfere with the performance of any Base Building Work or Landlord's Work and is coordinated with Building management.

Pre-Commencement Entry.
 
ARTICLE 4 Rent
 
  Commencing as of the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay rent to Landlord, by electronic fund transfer (or by such other method, as set forth below, or to such other person or entity as Landlord may by notice in writing to Tenant from time to time direct), at the Annual Fixed Rent Rate, in equal installments at the Monthly Fixed Rent Rate (which is 1/12th of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate), in advance, without notice or demand, and without setoff, abatement, suspension, deferment, reduction or deduction, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, on the first day of each calendar month included in the term; and for any portion of a calendar month following the Rent Commencement Date, at the rate for the first Lease Year payable in advance for such portion. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements, that the Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord shall continue to be payable in all events and that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the requirement to pay or perform the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express provision of this Lease.
4.1
                                
The Fixed Rent.
 
If Landlord shall give notice to Tenant that all rent and/or other payments due hereunder are to be made to Landlord by check, or by any other commercially reasonable means, Tenant shall make all such payments as shall be due after receipt of said notice by means as designated by Landlord, with such payments to be made to such address and to such person or entity as is specified by Landlord.
 
The Annual Fixed Rent, the Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease are sometimes referred to herein as "Rent."
 
  Tenant covenants and agrees to pay, as Additional Rent, insurance costs, utility charges, personal property taxes and its pro rata share of taxes and operating costs with respect to the Premises and the Property as provided in this Section 4.2 as follows:
4.2
                                
Additional Rent.
 
  Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, for each tax period partially or wholly included in the Term, Tenant's Percentage of Taxes (as hereinafter defined).  Tenant shall remit to Landlord, on the first day of each calendar month, estimated payments on account of Taxes, such monthly amounts to be sufficient to provide Landlord, by the time real estate tax payments are due and payable to any governmental authority responsible for collection of same, a sum equal to the Tenant's Percentage of Taxes, as reasonably estimated by Landlord from time to time on the basis of the most recent tax data available.  The initial calculation of the monthly estimated payments shall be based upon the Initial Estimate of Tenant's Percentage of Taxes for the Tax Year and upon quarterly payments being due to the governmental authority on August 1, November 1, February 1 and May 1, and shall be made when the Commencement Date has been determined.  If the total of such monthly remittances for any Tax Year is greater than the Tenant's Percentage of Taxes for such Tax year, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments to be made by Tenant pursuant to this subsection 4.2.1, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the Tenant's Percentage of Taxes for such Tax Year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord at least ten (10) days prior to the date or dates within such Tax Year that any Taxes become due and payable to the governmental authority (but in any event no earlier than ten (10) days following a written notice to Tenant, which notice shall set forth the manner of computation of Tenant's Percentage of Taxes).

Provided Landlord is not prosecuting an abatement with respect thereto, Tenant may, upon prior notice to Landlord, prosecute appropriate proceedings for abatement or reduction of any tax with respect to which Tenant is required to make payments as hereinbefore provided, such proceedings to be conducted jointly with any other parties, including Landlord, who have contributed to the payment of such taxes, and Tenant agrees to save Landlord harmless from all costs and expenses incurred on account of Tenant's participation in such proceedings.  Landlord, without obligating itself to incur any costs or expenses in connection with such proceedings, shall cooperate with Tenant with respect to such proceedings so far as reasonably necessary.  Any abatement or reduction effected by such proceedings shall accrue to the benefit of Tenant and Landlord and such other parties as their interests may appear according to their respective contributions to the taxes involved in any such proceedings.
 
In the event this Lease shall commence, or shall end (by reason of expiration of the term or earlier termination pursuant to the provisions hereof), on any date other than the first or last day of the Tax Year, or should the Tax Year or period of assessment of real estate taxes be changed or be more or less than one (1) year, as the case may be, then the amount of Taxes which may be payable by Tenant as provided in this subsection 4.2.1 shall be appropriately apportioned and adjusted.

If, at any time during the term of this Lease, any tax or excise on rents or other taxes, however described, are levied or assessed against Landlord with respect to the rent reserved hereunder, either wholly or partially in substitution for, or in addition to, real estate taxes assessed or levied on the Property, such tax or excise on rents shall be included in Taxes.  Taxes shall include any estimated payment made by Landlord on account of a fiscal tax period for which the actual and final amount of taxes for such period has not been determined by the governmental authority as of the date of any such estimated payment.  The following shall be from Taxes and shall be paid solely by Landlord: inheritance, estate, succession, transfer, gift, franchise, or capital stock tax, or any income taxes arising out of or related to ownership and operation of income-producing real estate, or any excise taxes imposed upon Landlord based upon gross or net rentals or other income received by it, any increase in taxes and assessments resulting solely from Landlord's sale of, or other transfer of its interest in, the Building, and assessments, charges, taxes, rents, rates, levies, excises, license fees, permit fees, inspection fees, or other authorization fees or charges to the extent allocable to or caused by the development or installation of off-Premises improvements or utilities (including without limitation street and intersection improvements, roads, rights of way, lighting, and signalization) necessary for any past, present or future system development reimbursement schedule or sinking fund related to any of the foregoing, except to the extent any of the foregoing may be properly allocable to and charged against the Premises pursuant to another provision of this Lease.

The initial monthly estimated payments shall be in an amount equal to 1/12th of the Initial Estimate of Tenant's Percentage of Operating Costs for the Calendar Year.  If, at the expiration of the year in respect of which monthly installments of Operating Costs shall have been made as aforesaid, the total of such monthly remittances is greater than the actual Operating Costs for such year, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant, or credit against the next accruing payments to be made by Tenant pursuant to this subsection 4.2.3, the difference; if the total of such remittances is less than the Operating Costs for such year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days from the date Landlord shall furnish to Tenant an itemized statement of the Operating Costs, prepared, allocated and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

If it is determined that Tenant is entitled to a refund, then such refund shall either be in cash or applied as a credit to the next due installment of Rent, at the election of Landlord.  If it is determined Tenant has underpaid, then Tenant shall pay such amount within thirty (30) days of Landlord's invoice therefor.  Tenant agrees to use for such inspection a firm that is reasonably acceptable to Landlord and that is not being paid on a contingency fee basis. If Operating Costs were overstated by more than three percent (3%), then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the reasonable cost of the audit.

  Tenant shall, at its expense, as Additional Rent, take out and maintain throughout the term the following insurance protecting Landlord:
4.2.4
      
Insurance.
 
Commercial general liability insurance naming Landlord, Tenant, and Landlord's managing agent and any mortgagee of which Tenant has been given notice as additional insureds  and indemnifying the parties so named against all claims and demands for death or any injury to person or damage to property which may be claimed to have occurred on the Premises (or the Property, insofar as used by customers, employees, servants or invitees of the Tenant), in amounts which shall, at the beginning of the term, be at least equal to the limits set forth in Section 1.1, and, which, from time to time during the term, shall be for such higher limits, if any, as are customarily carried in the area in which the Premises are located on property similar to the Premises and used for similar purposes; and workmen's compensation insurance with statutory limits covering all of Tenant's employees working on the Premises.
4.2.4.1
           
 
Special Risk property insurance with the usual extended coverage endorsements covering all Tenant's furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment, and business interruption insurance, with extra expense coverage.
4.2.4.2
           
 
All such policies shall be obtained from responsible companies qualified to do business and in good standing in Massachusetts, which companies and the amount of insurance allocated thereto shall be subject to Landlord's approval.  Tenant agrees to furnish Landlord with certificates evidencing all such insurance prior to the beginning of the term hereof and evidencing renewal thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of any such policy.  Each such policy shall be non-cancelable with respect to the interest of Landlord and the insurer will endeavor to notify Landlord at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of any policy, but in any event no later than five (5) days following cancelation thereof.
4.2.4.3
           
 
All insurance which is carried by either Landlord or Tenant with respect to the Building, Premises or to furniture, furnishings, fixtures, or equipment therein or alterations or improvements thereto, whether or not required, shall include provisions which either designate the other party as one of the insured or deny to the insurer acquisition by subrogation of rights of recovery against the other party to the extent such rights have
4.2.4.4
           
 
been waived by the insured party prior to occurrence of loss or injury, insofar as, and to the extent that, such provisions may be effective without making it impossible to obtain insurance coverage from responsible companies qualified to do business in the state in which the Premises are located (even though extra premium may result therefrom).  In the event that extra premium is payable by either party as a result of this provision, the other party shall reimburse the party paying such premium the amount of such extra premium.  If at the request of one party, this non-subrogation provision is waived, then the obligation of reimbursement shall cease for such period of time as such waiver shall be effective, but nothing contained in this subsection shall derogate from or otherwise affect releases elsewhere herein contained of either party for claims.  Each party shall be entitled to have certificates of any policies containing such provisions.  Each party hereby waives all rights of recovery against the other for loss or injury against which the waiving party is protected by insurance containing said provisions, reserving, however, any rights with respect to any excess of loss or injury over the amount recovered by such insurance.
 
  Tenant shall pay directly to the applicable utility provider all charges made by such utility provider for the cost of electricity and gas furnished or consumed on the Premises, which are separately metered; Tenant shall pay to Landlord, through Operating Costs, all charges for water (including sewer charges) supplied by Landlord pursuant to Subsection 5.1.3.

Except as otherwise provided in Article 5, it is understood and agreed that Tenant shall make its own arrangements for the installation or provision of all such utilities and that Landlord shall be under no obligation to furnish any utilities to the Premises and shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any such utilities to the Premises.
4.2.5
      
Utilities.
 
  If any installment of Fixed Rent is paid five (5) or more days after notice the same is overdue, and if on a prior occasion in the twelve (12) month period prior to the date such installment was due an installment of rent was paid after the same was due, then Tenant shall pay Landlord a late payment fee equal to five (5%) percent of the current overdue payment.
4.3
         
Late Payment of Rent.
 
The performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall be secured by a letter of credit throughout the term hereof in accordance with and subject to the following terms and conditions:
4.4
         
Letter of Credit.
 
   Concurrently with Tenant's execution and delivery of this Lease,  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the "Original Letter of Credit") which shall be (i) in the form of Exhibit H attached to this Lease (the "Form LC"), (ii) issued by a commercial bank reasonably satisfactory to Landlord upon which presentment may be made in Boston, Massachusetts, (iii) in the amount equal to the Letter of Credit Amount, and (iv) for a term of at least 1 year, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4.2 below.  The Original Letter of Credit, any Additional Letters(s) of Credit and Substitute Letter(s) of Credit are referred to herein as the "Letter of Credit."
4.4.1
      
Amount of Letter of Credit.
 
  Each Letter of Credit shall be automatically renewable in accordance with the second to last paragraph of the Form LC; provided however, that Tenant shall be required to deliver to Landlord a new letter of credit (a "Substitute Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit under Section 4.4.1 on or before the date 30 days prior to the expiration of the term of the Letter of Credit then in effect, if the issuer of such Letter of Credit gives notice of its election not to renew such Letter of Credit for any additional period pursuant thereto.  Should any Letter of Credit contain a final expiration date, in addition to a current expiration date, such final expiration date shall be no earlier than 45 days following the Expiration Date of this Lease.  If Tenant does not deliver a Substitute Letter of Credit 30 days prior to the expiration of the current Letter of Credit, Landlord shall be permitted to draw down the entire Letter of Credit Amount and hold the cash as "Security Proceeds" pursuant to Section 4.4.6 below.
4.4.2
      
Renewal of Letter of Credit.
 
  If the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum payable to Landlord hereunder shall be overdue and unpaid or should Landlord make payments on behalf of the Tenant, or Tenant shall fail to perform any of the terms of this Lease in all cases beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit the amount necessary to cure such default. In the event of any such draw by the Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an additional Letter of Credit ("Additional Letter of Credit") satisfying the requirements for the Original Letter of Credit, except that the amount of such Additional Letter of Credit shall be the amount of such draw, or (b) a substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Original Letter of Credit).
4.4.3
      
Draws to Cure Defaults.
 
  In addition, if (i) this Lease shall have been terminated as a result of Tenant's default under this Lease beyond the expiration of the applicable cure period, and/or (ii) this Lease shall have been rejected in a bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding, then Landlord shall have the right at any time thereafter to draw down from the Letter of Credit an amount sufficient to pay any and all damages payable by Tenant on account of such termination or rejection, as the case may be, pursuant to Article 8 hereof. In the event of bankruptcy or other creditor-debtor proceeding against Tenant, all proceeds of the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.
4.4.4
      
Draws to Pay Damages.
 
  In the event the issuer of any Letter of Credit becomes insolvent or is placed into receivership or conservatorship by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any successor or similar entity, or if a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for the issuer, then, effective as of the date of such occurrence, the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to not meet the requirements of this Section 4.4 and Tenant shall, within five (5) business days of written notice from Landlord, deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit which otherwise meets the requirements of this Section, or, alternatively, Tenant shall, within such five (5) business-day period deliver cash to Landlord in the Letter of Credit Amount, which Landlord shall hold as "Security Proceeds", governed by the provisions of Section 4.4.6 below.
4.4.5
      
Issuing Bank.
 
  If Tenant fails timely to deliver to Landlord a Substitute Letter of Credit, then Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter, without giving any notice to Tenant, to draw down the Letter of Credit and to hold the proceeds thereof  ("Security Proceeds") in a bank account in the name of Landlord, which may be withdrawn and applied by Landlord under the same circumstances and for the same purposes as if the Security Proceeds were a Letter of Credit. Upon any such application of Security Proceeds by Landlord, Tenant shall, within 30 days of written demand therefor, deliver to Landlord either (a) an Additional Letter of Credit in the amount of Security Proceeds so applied, or (b) a Substitute Letter of Credit in the Letter of Credit Amount (to be exchanged for the Security Proceeds).
4.4.6
      
Draws for Failure to  Deliver Substitute Letter of Credit.
 
Landlord shall be entitled to transfer its beneficial interest under the Letter of Credit or any Security Proceeds in connection with (i) Landlord's sale or transfer of the Building, or (ii) the addition, deletion or modification of any beneficiaries under the Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit shall specifically state on its face that it is transferable by Landlord, its successors and assigns.  Landlord  shall be responsible for all costs and fees charged to effect such transfer.
4.4.7
      
Transferability.
 
Within 45 days after the expiration of  the term, to the extent Landlord has not previously drawn upon any Letter of Credit or Security Proceeds held by Landlord, Landlord shall return the same to Tenant, less so much thereof that Landlord reasonably estimates is necessary to compensate Landlord toward the curing of any continuing default of any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, specifically including any restoration obligations under Section 6.1.9.
4.4.8
      
Return of Letter of Credit at End of Term.
 
On the condition that (a) Tenant is not in default at the time of the applicable reduction, (b) has not been in default of its monetary obligations under this Lease more than two times during the Term, (c) Tenant has had a net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year of Tenant prior to the applicable reduction (the "Profitability Test") as shown on Tenant's Consolidated Statement of Operations in its most recent annual report, and (d) to the extent Tenant is no longer a public company, Tenant provides Landlord with an audited statement reporting satisfaction of the Profitability Test, then the Letter of Credit Amount shall be reduced as follows:
4.4.9
      
Reduction in Letter of Credit Amount.
 
at the end of the 2 Lease Year, by $23,977.00;
(i)
           
nd
 
at the end of the 3rd Lease Year, by $23,977.00; and
(ii)
          
 
at the end of the 5th Lease Year, by $23,977.00.
(iii)
         
 
If Tenant fails to qualify for any reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount due solely to Tenant's inability to satisfy the Profitability Test as of the date of the applicable reduction, Tenant shall nevertheless be permitted to effect a reduction of $23,977.00 at any time after the stated reduction date once Tenant satisfies the Profitability Test and delivers proof thereof to Landlord, provided that Tenant otherwise satisfies the remaining conditions listed above in this Section 4.4.9.  Any reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount for which Tenant qualifies after the applicable reduction date shall not diminish or postpone any subsequent reduction.  Except as provided above, there shall be no reductions in the Letter of Credit Amount, it being understood that at no time shall the Letter of Credit Amount be less than $71,935.00.  Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for taking all necessary steps to effect a reduction, provided however that Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant to amend the Letter of Credit or obtain a Substitute Letter of Credit, as applicable, at no cost to Landlord.

  Landlord shall be under no responsibility or liability for failure or interruption of any of the above-described services, repairs or replacements caused by breakage, accident, strikes, repairs, inability to obtain supplies, labor or materials, or for any other causes beyond the control of the Landlord, and in no event for any indirect or consequential damages to Tenant; and failure or omission on the part of the Landlord to furnish any of same for any of the reasons set forth in this paragraph shall not be construed as an eviction of Tenant, actual or constructive, nor entitle Tenant to an abatement of rent (except with respect to an "Abatement Event" as provided below), nor render the Landlord liable in damages, nor release Tenant from prompt fulfillment of any of its covenants under this Lease.
5.2
          
Interruption.
 
An "Abatement Event" shall be defined as an event or circumstance (other than those addressed in Article 7) that reasonably prevents Tenant from using the entire Premises, or any material portion thereof, or the parking areas of the Property, as a result of Landlord's failure to provide any service required to be provided by Landlord under this Lease that is essential for Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Premises, or to provide reasonable access to the Premises, provided that such failure or Landlord's inability to remedy such event or circumstance is not due to a cause beyond Landlord's reasonable control generally affecting other buildings in the vicinity of the Premises (such as a neighborhood power outage).  Tenant shall give Landlord notice (an "Abatement Notice") of any such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement Event continues beyond the "Eligibility Period" (as that term is defined below), then the Monthly Fixed Rent and monthly charges on account of Operating Costs and Taxes shall be abated entirely or proportionately, as the case may be, after the expiration of the Eligibility Period for such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable area of the Premises.  Tenant shall not be entitled to an abatement of Rent if Tenant is then in default of its monetary obligations beyond the expiration of all notice and cure periods under this Lease.  The term "Eligibility Period" shall mean a period of five (5) consecutive business days after Landlord's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s).
 
  Tenant may, at its sole cost and expense, contract for security services for the Premises, which Landlord acknowledges may involve the installation of cameras, monitory devices and alarms, (which installation shall be subject to all of the requirements of Section 6.2.5 below).  Tenant shall be permitted to provide outside services within the Premises over and above those services to be provided by Landlord as set forth herein (subject to Landlord's reasonable approval if relating to HVAC maintenance), in which event all costs relating to the provision of such outside services shall be excluded from "Operating Costs", if applicable.  Landlord will contract with its snow removal vendor for snow and ice to be removed from the Property.  If Landlord is unable to cause the snow to be removed to Tenant's satisfaction, Landlord shall not be deemed in default of this Lease, but Tenant may elect to provide its own snow and ice removal and opt out of the services provided by Landlord by giving Landlord written notification of its election, which election will remain fixed for the remainder of the then current winter season, and in which event all costs relating to the provision of snow removal services shall be excluded from "Operating Costs" and Landlord shall have no obligation to provide Tenant with the same until the following winter season.
5.3
          
Tenant's Security; Outside  Services; Snow Removal
 
  Subject to Landlord's security requirements (if any), Tenant shall have access to the Building and the parking area serving the Building 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
5.4
          
Access.
 
A. Landlord represents to Tenant to Landlord's actual knowledge that, except as may be disclosed in that certain Remedial Monitoring Report No. 18, Northwest Park, Buildings 28 and 37, Burlington, MA (RTN 3-0263) prepared by GEI Consultants, Inc., dated September 29, 2009 (the "RMR Report"), there are no hazardous materials in, on, about, under or emanating from the Premises or the Site (as that term is defined in the RMR Report) in violation of any laws.  Landlord shall indemnify and defend, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant, and hold Tenant harmless from and against, any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, claims, fees, penalties, and fines incurred by Tenant as a result of the existence prior to and on the Date of this Lease of hazardous materials, or oil  in, on or about the Premises
5.5
          
Environmental.
 
or the Site; provided, however, that with respect to claims against Tenant by employees or former employees of Tenant relating to such pre-existing hazardous materials or oil, Landlord shall have no duty to defend Tenant, and Landlord's obligation to indemnify Tenant in such cases shall apply only if such employee's claim prevails, despite Tenant having used reasonable efforts to defend such claim, in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction through final judgment, with no further appeal.  Landlord shall not be responsible for any claims for consequential damages or lost profits of Tenant.  Tenant hereby acknowledges receipt of the RMR Report.
 
B. Landlord shall, prior to the Commencement Date, conduct indoor air quality testing, and may conduct testing of other environmental media, to confirm the absence of vapor intrusion into the Building from contamination in soil or groundwater at or near the Building that poses a significant risk to future occupants (office workers) and users of the Building, as determined under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, 310 CMR 40.0000 et seq.  Prior to conducting the testing, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a copy of the proposed sampling plan.  If the testing yields data indicating that indoor air quality (or other media) that results from vapor intrusion from contaminated soil or groundwater poses a significant risk to future occupants or users of the Building, as determined under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, 310 CMR 40.0000 et seq., then Landlord promptly shall at its sole cost and expense take necessary response actions as recommended by Landlord's Licensed Site Professional ("LSP") to eliminate any significant risk to occupants or users of the Building.  Landlord shall obtain from its LSP a reliance letter reasonably acceptable to Tenant that will allow Tenant to rely upon the findings and recommendations contained in the reports produced by the LSP.  Landlord's LSP shall be Margret Hanley or another LSP reasonably acceptable to Tenant.
 
Landlord shall maintain in full force throughout the Term, a policy of insurance upon the Building insuring against all risks of physical loss or damage under a "special" coverage form in an amount at least equal to the full replacement value of the Building, with an Agreed Amount endorsement, as well as insurance against breakdown of boilers and other machinery as customarily insured against.
5.6
          
Insurance.
 
Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant as of the date hereof that (a) Landlord holds fee simple title to the Property, subject to no mortgage other than a mortgage to Webster Bank; (b) Landlord has full power and authority to enter into this Lease; (c) no other party has any possessory right to the Premises or has claimed the same; and (d) Landlord has not received notice within the 12-month period preceding the Date of this Lease of any noncompliance with any land use laws or environmental laws relating to the Building that would adversely affect Tenant's ability to use the Premises.
5.7
          
Representations.
 
Landlord shall save harmless, exonerate and indemnify Tenant, its agents and employees (such agents and employees being referred to collectively as the "Tenant Related Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities or penalties asserted by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or public authority on account of injury, death, damage or loss to person or property occurring in the areas of the Property outside of the Premises arising out of the negligence, fault or misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's failure to perform and observe the obligations expressly assumed under the provisions of this Lease, except if the same was caused by the negligence, fault or misconduct of Tenant or the Tenant Related Parties.  In respect of all of the foregoing, Landlord shall indemnify Tenant and the Tenant Related Parties from and against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and liabilities incurred in or in connection with any such claim, action or proceeding brought thereon; and, in case of any action or proceeding brought against Tenant or the Tenant Related Parties by reason of any such claim, Landlord, upon notice from Tenant and at Landlord's expense, shall resist or defend such action or proceeding and employ counsel therefor reasonably satisfactory to Tenant provided that Tenant shall be deemed to have approved counsel provided by Landlord's liability insurer.

In addition, Tenant shall, at its sole expense, contract for cleaning and janitorial services to the Premises, including window cleaning.  A trash dumpster enclosure is currently located on the Property in an area designated by Landlord.  Tenant shall, at its expense, contract directly for a trash dumpster to be housed on the Property in such enclosure and to be emptied on a regular basis. However, Tenant shall have the right to relocate the dumpster, from time to time, to a location on the Property reasonably approved by Landlord, subject to all permitting and other requirements of the Town of Burlington and  Landlord's reasonable requirements as to size and screening.  Subject to Tenant's compliance with all requirements of the Town of Burlington, Tenant shall be permitted to keep a cardboard recycling container in an area on the Property reasonably approved by Landlord.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant shall not be responsible for compliance with any such laws, regulations, or the like requiring (a) structural repairs or modifications; or (b) repairs or modifications to the utility or building service equipment; or (c) installation of new building service equipment, such as fire detection or suppression equipment, unless such repairs, modifications, or installations shall be due to Tenant's particular manner of use of the Premises (as opposed to office use generally) or required on account of any work done by or on behalf of Tenant.
6.1.4
      
Compliance with Law.
 
  To save harmless, exonerate and indemnify Landlord, its agents (including, without limitation, Landlord's managing agent) and employees (such agents and employees being referred to collectively as the "Landlord Related Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities or penalties asserted by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or public authority on account of injury, death, damage or loss to person or property in or upon the Premises and the Property arising out of the use or occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or by any person claiming by, through or under Tenant (including, without limitation, all patrons, employees and customers of Tenant), or arising out of any delivery to or service supplied to the Premises, or on account of or based upon anything whatsoever done on the Premises, except if the same was caused by the willful negligence, fault or misconduct of Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties.  In respect of all of the foregoing, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties from and against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and liabilities incurred in or in connection with any such claim, action or proceeding brought thereon; and, in case of any action or proceeding brought against Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties by reason of any such claim, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord and at Tenant's expense, shall resist or defend such action or proceeding and employ counsel therefor reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.  The preceding indemnification shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
6.1.5
      
Indemnification.
 
  To permit Landlord and its agents to enter into and examine the Premises at reasonable times, and upon reasonable prior notice when practical, and to show the Premises, and to make repairs to the Premises, and, during the last six (6) months prior to the expiration of this Lease, to keep affixed in suitable places notices of availability of the Premises.  Landlord's entry shall be subject to Tenant's reasonable security rules, including the requirement that Landlord be accompanied by a Tenant representative (except in emergency circumstances).
6.1.6
      
Landlord's Right to Enter.
 
  All of the furnishings, fixtures, equipment, effects and property of every kind, nature and description of Tenant and of all persons claiming by, through or under Tenant which, during the continuance of this Lease or any occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant, may be on the Premises, shall be at the sole risk and hazard of Tenant and if the whole or any part thereof shall be destroyed or damaged by fire, water or otherwise, or by the leakage or bursting of water pipes, steam pipes, or other pipes, by theft or from any other cause, no part of said loss or damage is to be charged to or to be borne by Landlord, except that Landlord shall in no event be indemnified or held harmless or exonerated from any liability to Tenant or to any other person, for any injury, loss, damage or liability to the extent prohibited by law.
6.1.7
      
Personal Property at Tenant's Risk.
 
  To pay on demand Landlord's expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in enforcing any obligation of Tenant under this Lease or in curing any default by Tenant under this Lease as provided in Section 8.4.
6.1.8
      
Payment of Landlord's Cost of Enforcement.
 
  At the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease:  to surrender all keys to the Premises; to remove all of its trade fixtures and personal property in the Premises; to deliver to Landlord stamped architectural plans showing the Premises at yield up (which may be the Final Plans if Tenant has made no installations after the Commencement Date); to remove all wiring and cabling; to remove all rooftop equipment, and such installations and alterations made by it, including the TIW, as Landlord had designated for removal at the time of Landlord's approval of such installations or alterations (as set forth below) and all Tenant's signs wherever located; to repair all damage caused by such removal and restore any damaged areas to normal office finishes standard for the Building; and to yield up the Premises, including all installations and improvements made by Tenant (which shall be intact and in good working order, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted), except for Tenant's trade fixtures and such of said installations or improvements as Landlord shall have requested Tenant to remove at the time of plan approval as set forth below.  Landlord reserves the right to require removal of any  alterations for which plans were not required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.2.5 of this Lease if Tenant had failed to so request Landlord's designation for removal as set forth in Section 6.2.5.  Tenant shall surrender the Premises broom-clean and in the condition the same were in on the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted. Tenant, at the time of requesting Landlord's approval of any installations or alterations in the Premises, including the TIW and any Tenant's Work Change Orders (whether or not plans are required for the installation) shall request in writing that Landlord designate which such installations or alterations must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  After receipt of Tenant's request, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing which such installations or alterations must be removed from the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord does not indicate that a particular installation must be removed, then Landlord shall not later have the right to request its removal.  Likewise, if Tenant, when making any installations or alterations, fails to so request in writing whether Landlord will require removal of such installation or alteration, then Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to remove the installation or alteration at the end of the Term. With respect to the TIW, Tenant need not make a formal written request; however Landlord shall, as part of its approval of the Schematic Design Plans provide a preliminary summary of which items, if any, it requires be removed. Landlord will provide Tenant with a progress summary of items designated for removal as soon as practical following receipt of the Design Development Permitting/Pricing Plans, taking into consideration that the resulting Final Plans may necessitate amendment of Landlord's summary of items that require end of term removal..  In any event, Landlord agrees to be reasonable in determining whether any installation or alteration must be removed and agrees to limit its removal requirements to those installations or alterations that Landlord deems specialized for Tenant's use and not typical for normal office tenant use (such as specialty process electrical systems, chillers, generators, nitrogen tanks, by way of example, but not finishes and architectural elements included in the TIW.  Any property required to be removed that is not so removed shall be deemed abandoned and, if Landlord so elects, deemed to be Landlord's property, and may be retained or removed and disposed of by Landlord in such manner as Landlord shall determine and Tenant shall pay Landlord the entire cost and expense incurred by it in effecting such removal and disposition and in making any incidental repairs and replacements to the Premises.  Tenant shall further indemnify Landlord against all loss, cost and damage resulting from Tenant's failure and delay in surrendering the Premises as above provided; however, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages if Tenant occupies the Premises for fewer than thirty (30) days beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  Except as specifically provided for in this Section 6.1.9, Tenant shall not be liable for any consequential damages for breach of any provision of this Lease.
6.1.9
      
Yield Up.
 
If the Tenant remains in the Premises beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, such holding over shall be without right and shall not be deemed to create any tenancy, but the Tenant shall be a tenant at sufferance only at a daily rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent in effect under this Lease as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease, for the first thirty (30) days of such holding over, and thereafter at a daily rate of two (2) times the Rent in effect as of the day prior to the date of expiration of this Lease.
 
  To comply with the Rules and Regulations set forth in Exhibit E, and with all reasonable Rules and Regulations of general applicability to all tenants of the Park hereafter made by Landlord, of which Tenant has been given notice.  Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for the failure of other tenants to conform to such Park-wide Rules and Regulations of which Tenant has been given notice.  Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to enforce the Park-wide Rules and Regulations and shall apply the same in a non-discriminatory manner.
6.1.10
    
Rules and Regulations.
 
  Upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written request by Landlord, to execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing, which may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F or in another form reasonably similar thereto, or such other commercially reasonable form as Landlord may provide from time to time, certifying all or any of the following to the extent true:  (i) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, (ii) whether the term has commenced and Fixed Rent and Additional Rent have become payable
6.1.11
    
Estoppel Certificate.
 
hereunder and, if so, the dates to which they have been paid, (iii) whether or not Landlord is in default in performance of any of the terms of this Lease, (iv) whether Tenant has accepted possession of the Premises, (v) whether Tenant has made any claim against Landlord under this Lease and, if so, the nature thereof and the dollar amount, if any, of such claim, (vi) whether there exist any offsets or defenses against enforcement of any of the terms of this Lease upon the part of Tenant to be performed, and (vii) such further information with respect to the Lease or the Premises as Landlord may reasonably request.  Any such statement delivered pursuant to this subsection 6.1.11 may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Premises, or any prospective assignee of such mortgage.  Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord such financial information as may be reasonably required by Landlord to be provided to any mortgagee or prospective purchaser of the Premises.  The requirement of the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.
 
  To reimburse Landlord promptly on demand for all reasonable legal expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with all requests by Tenant for consent or approval hereunder.
6.1.12
    
Landlord's Expenses Re: Consents.
 
Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord that the person signing below has full power and authority to bind Tenant and that Tenant has the authority to enter into this Lease and has obtained all consents and approvals and taken all actions necessary in connection therewith.
6.1.13
    
Representation
 
  Tenant covenants at all times during the term and such further time (prior or subsequent thereto) as Tenant occupies the Premises or any part thereof:
6.2
          
Negative Covenants.
 
  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, not to assign, transfer, mortgage or pledge this Lease or to sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions and licenses and the like) all or any part of the Premises or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate hereby created or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned, transferred or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, or permit the occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord.  In the event Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublet any portion or all of the Premises  (whether to a Successor or Affiliate or to a third party), Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of Tenant's intent to so assign this Lease or sublet the Premises and the proposed effective date of such subletting or assignment, and, in the case of a transfer to a third party, shall request in such notification that Landlord consent thereto.  Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, Landlord may terminate this Lease in the case of a proposed assignment or any proposed sublet of the Premises for the remainder of the Term, and, in the case of any proposed subletting that results in 50% or more of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises being sublet.If Landlord exercises its recapture right, it shall do so by giving written notice of termination to Tenant within ten (10) days after Tenant's request for consent and Landlord's receipt of all relevant information reasonably required by Landlord, with such termination to be effective as of the effective date of such assignment or subletting.  Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed a waiver of its recapture right.  If Landlord does not so terminate or is deemed to have waived its right to terminate, Landlord's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld to an assignment or to a subletting of the entire Premises, provided that the following conditions are met:
6.2.1
      
Assignment and Subletting.
 
the assignee or subtenant shall use the Premises only for the Permitted Uses;
(i)
           
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant has a net worth and, in the case of an assignee, creditworthiness, reasonably sufficient to enable it to perform the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, or the sublease, as applicable;
(ii)
          
 
the amount of the aggregate rent to be paid by the proposed subtenant is not less than eighty (80%) percent of the then current market rate for the Premises; and
(iii)
         
 
the proposed assignee or subtenant is not then a tenant in the Building or the Park, or an entity with which Landlord is dealing or has dealt within the preceding six months regarding the possibility of leasing space in the Building or the Park, and Landlord actually has available reasonably comparable space in the Park.
(iv)
         
 
Tenant shall furnish Landlord with any information reasonably requested by Landlord to enable Landlord to determine whether the proposed assignment or subletting complies with the foregoing requirements, including without limitation, financial statements relating to the proposed assignee or subtenant.  Tenant's rights under Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 6.2.5.1 are personal to the initial named Tenant and may not be assigned except in connection with an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor.
 
Tenant shall, as Additional Rent, reimburse Landlord promptly for Landlord's reasonable legal expenses incurred in connection with any request by Tenant for such consent.  If Landlord consents thereto, no such subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder, and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation to obtain the Landlord's written approval in the case of any other subletting or assignment.
 
If for any assignment or sublease consented to by Landlord hereunder Tenant receives rent or other consideration, either initially or over the term of the assignment or sublease, in excess of the rent called for hereunder, or in case of sublease of part, in excess of such rent fairly allocable to the part.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent fifty (50%) percent of the excess of each such payment of rent or other consideration received by Tenant promptly after its receipt.  In calculating any excess rent payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this provision, Tenant shall first be entitled to deduct (a) the gross Fixed Rent and Additional Rent paid to Landlord by Tenant with respect to the subject portion of the Premises during the period commencing on the date Tenant vacates the subject portion of the Premises until the date the assignee or sublessee is obligated to pay rent pursuant to its assignment or sublease; (b) improvement allowances or other economic concessions granted by Tenant to the assignee or sublessee; (c) the unamortized costs of initial and subsequent improvements to the sublet portion of the Premises paid for by Tenant and amortized over the sublease term; (d) costs incurred by Tenant to buy out or take over the previous lease of the assignee or sublessee; (e) all costs incurred by Tenant to advertise the subject portion of the Premises for assignment or sublease; (f) brokerage commissions and legal fees paid by Tenant in connection with the assignment or sublease; and (g) all other costs reasonably incurred by Tenant.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, the preceding provisions of this Section 6.2.1 shall not apply to a sublet of all or any portion of the Premises or an assignment of this Lease to either (i) an entity which is controlled by, is under common control with, or which controls Tenant (any of the foregoing, an "Affiliate") or (ii) an entity into or with which Tenant is merged or consolidated or which acquires all or substantially all of Tenant's stock or assets (any of the foregoing, a "Successor"), provided that in the case of an assignment of this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor (1) such Affiliate or Successor, as the case may be, agrees directly with Landlord, by written instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, to assume and perform all the obligations of Tenant; (2) Tenant continues to remain primarily liable under this Lease; and (3) Tenant notifies Landlord of the merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, stock or membership interests) at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such transfer (except where the transaction must for legal and reasonable business purposes remain confidential, in which event such proof of net worth shall be delivered promptly after consummation of the transaction).  The transaction for which consent from the Landlord is not required pursuant to this paragraph shall be referred to as a "Permitted Transfer."
 
If at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a name change, reformation or reorganization of the Tenant entity, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord documenting such name change, reformation or reorganization.  If, at any time during the term of this Lease, there is a transfer of a controlling interest in the stock, membership or general partnership interests of Tenant, Tenant shall so notify Landlord and (whether or not Tenant so notifies Landlord) such a transfer will be deemed an assignment subject to the provisions of this Section 6.2.1.  The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not be applicable as long as Tenant is a publicly traded company.
 
  Not to injure, deface or otherwise harm the Premises; nor commit any nuisance; nor permit in the Premises any vending machine (except such as is used for the sale of merchandise to employees of Tenant) or inflammable fluids or chemicals (except such as are customarily used in connection with standard office equipment); nor permit any cooking to such extent as requires special exhaust venting; nor permit the emission of any objectionable noise or odor; nor make, allow or suffer any waste; nor make any use of the Premises which is improper, offensive or contrary to any law or ordinance or which will invalidate any of Landlord's insurance; nor conduct any auction, fire, "going out of business" or bankruptcy sales.
6.2.2
                    
Nuisance.
 
  Except for customary office and cleaning supplies (which shall be handled in compliance with all applicable laws), not to dispose of any hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil on the Premises or the Property, or into any of the plumbing, sewage, or drainage systems thereon, and to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from all claims, liability, loss or damage arising on account of the use or disposal of hazardous wastes, hazardous materials or oil, including, without limitation, liability under any federal, state, or local laws, requirements and regulations, or damage to any of the aforesaid systems.  Tenant shall comply with all governmental reporting requirements with respect to hazardous wastes, hazardous materials and oil, and shall deliver to Landlord copies of all reports filed with governmental authorities. The preceding indemnification shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
6.2.3
                    
Hazardous Wastes and Materials.
 
    Business machines and mechanical equipment which cause vibration or noise shall be placed and maintained by Tenant at Tenant's expense in settings sufficient to absorb and prevent vibration, noise and annoyance to adjacent properties.
6.2.4
                    
Heavy Equipment.
 
  A.     Not to make any installations, alterations or additions in, to or on the Premises nor to permit the making of any holes in the walls, partitions or ceilings (except for holes for normal office wall hangings such a pictures and the like) or floors, nor the installation or modification of any locks or security devices without on each occasion obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to interior, nonstructural alterations or installations that do not adversely affect the structural integrity of the Building, impact the Building systems, or involve penetration of the roof or exterior walls, and then only pursuant to plans and specifications approved by Landlord (acting reasonably) in advance in each instance.  Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant's request for consent and approval within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of all information reasonably requested by Landlord to evaluate Tenant's request.  If Landlord fails to respond by the expiration of such 10-day period, Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice captioned, "SECOND REQUEST FOR CONSENT," and Landlord's failure to respond within five (5) business days after receiving Tenant's second request shall be deemed approval.

In addition, Tenant may, without Landlord's prior consent, paint and carpet interior areas of the Premises that are not visible from outside the Premises.  In any instance where Tenant is permitted to make an installation or alteration without Landlord's prior consent, then Tenant shall, at the time of making such installation or alteration, request in writing if such installation or alteration must be removed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  If Landlord so designates such installation or alteration for removal, then Tenant shall remove the same in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1.9 above.  If Tenant fails to make such request, then Landlord shall have the option to require Tenant to remove such installation or alteration at the end of the Term.

ARTICLE 7 Casualty or Taking
 
  In the event that the Premises or the Buildingor 25% of the parking spaces serving the same, or any material part thereof, (a) shall be taken by any public authority or for any public use, and in the case of the parking areas, Landlord does not provide reasonable permanent alternative parking within 90 days of the taking, or (b) shall be Substantially Damaged (as hereinafter defined) by fire or casualty, or by the action of any public authority, or (c) the net proceeds of insurance recovered or damages awarded is insufficient to pay for the cost of restoration work, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Landlord.  The term "Substantially Damaged" as used herein shall mean damage so extensive that thirty-five (35%) percent or more of the Rentable Floor Area of the Building is destroyed.  Such election, which may be made notwithstanding the fact that Landlord's entire interest may have been divested, shall be made by the giving of notice by Landlord to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the date of the taking or casualty.  In the event that the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or casualty, or if there is a taking of a material part of the Premises or Building, and in either case, in the reasonable opinion of an independent architect or engineer selected by Landlord, cannot be repaired or restored within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the date of such event, then this Lease may be terminated at the election of Landlord or Tenant, which election shall be made by the giving of notice to the other party within thirty (30) days after the date the opinion of the architect or engineer is made available to the parties.

Termination.
,
 
  If neither Landlord nor Tenant elects to so terminate, this Lease shall continue in force and a just proportion of the rent reserved, according to the nature and extent of the damages sustained by the Premises, shall be suspended or abated until the Premises, or what may remain thereof, shall be put by Landlord in proper condition for use (which shall at least be the same as immediately prior to the taking or casualty), which Landlord covenants to do with reasonable diligence to the extent permitted by the net proceeds of insurance recovered, or recoverable if Landlord carried the coverage required to be carried hereunder, or damages awarded for such taking, destruction or damage and subject to zoning and building laws or ordinances then in existence.  "Net proceeds of insurance recovered or damages awarded" refers to the gross amount of such insurance or damages less the reasonable expenses of Landlord incurred in connection with the collection of the same, including without limitation, fees and expenses for legal and appraisal services.
7.2
                                
Restoration.
 
  Irrespective of the form in which recovery may be had by law, all rights to damages or compensation shall belong to Landlord in all cases, except for awards made for Tenant's moving expenses and equipment and trade fixtures.

ARTICLE 8 Defaults
 
  (a)  If Tenant shall default in the performance of any of its obligations to pay the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum due Landlord hereunder and if such default shall continue for ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord designating such default or if within thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant specifying any other default or defaults Tenant has not commenced diligently to correct the default or defaults so specified or has not thereafter diligently pursued such correction to completion, or (b)  if any assignment shall be made by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for the benefit of creditors, or (c)  if Tenant's leasehold interest shall be taken on execution, or (d)  if a lien or other involuntary encumbrance is filed against Tenant's leasehold interest or Tenant's other property, including said leasehold interest, and is not discharged within  fifteen (15) days thereafter, or (e)  if a petition is filed by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for liquidation, or for reorganization or an arrangement under any provision of any bankruptcy law or code as then in force and effect, or (f)  if an involuntary petition under any of the provisions of any bankruptcy law or code is filed against Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant and such involuntary petition is not dismissed within  ninety (90) days thereafter, then, and in any of such cases, Landlord and the agents and servants of Landlord lawfully may, in addition to and not in derogation of any remedies for any preceding breach of covenant, immediately or at any time thereafter without demand or notice and with or without process of law (forcibly, if necessary) enter into and upon the Premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole or mail a notice of termination addressed to Tenant, and repossess the same as of landlord's former estate and expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant and remove its and their effects (forcibly, if necessary) without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies which might otherwise be used for arrears of rent or prior breach of covenants, and upon such entry or mailing as aforesaid this Lease shall terminate, Tenant hereby waiving all statutory rights to the Premises (including without limitation rights of redemption, if any, to the extent such rights may be lawfully waived) and Landlord, without notice to Tenant, may store Tenant's effects, and those of any person claiming through or under Tenant, at the expense and risk of Tenant, and, if Landlord so elects, may sell such effects at public auction or private sale and apply the net proceeds to the payment of all sums due to Landlord from Tenant, if any, and pay over the balance, if any, to Tenant.
8.1
                                
Events of Default.
 
  In the event that this Lease is terminated under any of the provisions contained in Section 8.1 or shall be otherwise terminated for breach of any obligation of Tenant, Tenant covenants to pay punctually to Landlord all the sums and to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated.  In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the next preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with any amount paid to Landlord as compensation as in this Section 8.2 provided and also with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises, after deducting all Landlord's expense in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord may (i)  relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same and (ii)  make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same, and no action of Landlord in accordance with the foregoing or failure to relet or to collect rent under reletting shall operate or be construed to release or reduce Tenant's liability as aforesaid.
8.2
                                
Remedies.
 
In lieu of full recovery by Landlord of the sums payable under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 (except for the amount of any rent of any kind accrued and unpaid at the time of termination) Landlord may by written notice to Tenant, elect to recover, and Tenant shall thereupon pay forthwith to Landlord, as compensation, the discounted present value (calculated using a discount factor equal to the then "Prime Rate" as is used by the Bank of America or its successor) of the excess of the total rent reserved for the residue of the term over the rental value of the Premises for said residue of the term.  In calculating the rent
 
reserved there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value of all other considerations agreed to be paid or performed by Tenant for said residue.
 
Nothing contained in this Lease shall, however, limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove for and obtain in proceedings for bankruptcy or insolvency by reason of the termination of this Lease, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.
 
  Any and all rights and remedies which Landlord may have under this Lease, and at law and equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at the same time insofar as permitted by law.
8.3
                                
Remedies Cumulative.
 
 Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure, at any time, without notice, any default by Tenant under this Lease; and whenever Landlord so elects, all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in curing a default shall be paid, as Additional Rent, by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with lawful interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord to the date of payment by Tenant.
8.4
                                
Landlord's Right to Cure Defaults.
 
  Any consent or permission by Landlord to any act or omission which otherwise would be a breach of any covenant or condition herein, shall not in any way be held or construed (unless expressly so declared) to operate so as to impair the continuing obligation of any covenant or condition herein, or otherwise, except as to the specific instance, operate to permit similar acts or omissions.
8.5
                                
Effect of Waivers of Default.
 
 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation.  The receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord.  No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.
8.6
                                
No Waiver, etc.
 
  No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or charge due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent or other charge be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.
8.7
                                
No Accord and Satisfaction.
 
ARTICLE 9 Rights of Mortgage Holders
 
  The word "mortgage" as used herein includes mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments evidencing other voluntary liens or encumbrances, and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof.  The word "holder" shall mean a mortgagee, and any subsequent holder or holders of a mortgage.  Until the holder of a mortgage shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have only such rights of Landlord as are necessary to preserve the integrity of this Lease as security.  Upon entry and taking possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have all the rights of Landlord.  No such holder of a mortgage shall be liable either as mortgagee or as assignee, to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure.  Upon entry for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall be liable to perform all of the obligations of Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the provisions of Section 10.4, provided that a discontinuance of any foreclosure proceeding shall be deemed a conveyance under said provisions to the owner of the equity of the Property.
9.1
                                
Rights of Mortgage Holders.
 
The covenants and agreements contained in this Lease with respect to the rights, powers and benefits of a holder of a mortgage (particularly, without limitation thereby, the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 9.1) constitute a continuing offer to any person, corporation or other entity, which by accepting a mortgage subject to this Lease, assumes the obligations herein set forth with respect to such holder; such holder is hereby constituted a party of this Lease as an obligee hereunder to the same extent as though its name were written hereon as such; and such holder shall be entitled to enforce such provisions in its own name.  Tenant agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time any agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 9.1.
 
 A.  It is agreed that the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease shall be (i)  subject or subordinate to any present or future mortgage or mortgages and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest of the holder thereof in the Premises or any property of which the Premises are a part if Landlord shall elect by notice to Tenant to subject or subordinate the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease to such mortgage or (ii)  prior to any present or future mortgage or mortgages, if Landlord shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to give the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease priority to such mortgage; in the event of either of such elections and upon notification by
9.2
                                
Lease Superior or Subordinate to Mortgages.
 
Landlord to that effect, the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease should be deemed to be subordinate to, or have priority over, as the case may be, said mortgage or mortgages, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any such mortgage or mortgages (provided that, in the case of subordination of this Lease to any future mortgages, the holder thereof agrees to recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease and not to disturb the possession of Tenant).  Tenant agrees it will, upon not less than fifteen (15) days' prior written request by Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all reasonably acceptable instruments deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable to give effect to or notice of such subordination or priority.  Tenant agrees that any future SNDA that is similar in all material respects to the form of SNDA attached hereto as Exhibit I will be deemed "reasonably acceptable".  Any Mortgage to which this Lease shall be subordinated may contain such terms, provisions and conditions as the holder deems usual or customary.
 
B.            Landlord agrees to use diligent efforts to cause its current mortgagee to deliver to Tenant  a "subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement" in the form attached to this Lease as Exhibit I (the "SNDA"), no later than 5 business days after full execution of this Lease.  It is agreed that it shall be an express condition precedent to the validity of this Lease that Landlord's current mortgagee provides such an SNDA to Tenant, and if such SNDA is not provided to Tenant by the aforesaid date, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord no later than 10 business days after the full execution of this Lease, effective upon the giving of such notice.
 
ARTICLE 10 Miscellaneous Provisions
 
  All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and addressed, if to the Tenant, at the Original Notice Address of Tenant or such other address as Tenant shall have last designated by notice in writing to Landlord (with a copy by similar means to Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, Attn:  Paul Jakubowski) and, if to Landlord, at the Original Notice Address of Landlord or such other address as Landlord shall have last designated by notice in writing to Tenant.  Any notice shall be deemed duly given upon receipt or rejection when mailed to such address postage prepaid, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or on the next business day when sent by nationally recognized overnight courier, or when delivered to such address by hand.
10.1
                          
Notices from One Party to the Other.
 
 Landlord agrees that upon Tenant's paying the rent and performing and observing the agreements, conditions and other provisions on its part to be performed and observed, Tenant shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the term hereof without any manner of hindrance or molestation from Landlord or anyone claiming under Landlord, subject, however, to the terms of this Lease.
10.2
                          
Quiet Enjoyment.
 
  Each party  agrees that it will not record this Lease.  Both parties shall, upon the request of either, execute and deliver a notice or short form of this Lease in such form, if any, as may be permitted by applicable statute.  Following satisfaction of the contingencies set forth in Sections 2.2.1 and 9.2B, either party may record a notice of lease in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G, which notice of lease shall be executed at Lease signing but held until satisfaction of such contingencies.  Tenant agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver a notice of termination of lease in Tenant's name upon its execution of this Lease which is to be held in escrow by Landlord until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
10.3
                          
Lease not to be Recorded.
 
  The term "Landlord" as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations to be performed by Landlord are concerned, shall be limited to mean and include only the owner or owners at the time in question of the Property, and in the event of any transfer or transfers of title to said property, the Landlord (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then grantor) shall be concurrently freed and relieved from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance, without any further instrument or agreement of all liability as respects the performance of any covenants or obligations on the part of the Landlord contained in this Lease thereafter to be performed, it being intended hereby that the covenants and obligations contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord, shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on the Landlord, its successors and assigns, only during and in respect of their respective successive periods of ownership of said leasehold interest or fee, as the case may be.  Tenant, its successors and assigns, shall not assert nor seek to enforce any claim for breach of this Lease against any of Landlord's assets other than Landlord's interest in the Property and in the rents, issues and proceeds thereof, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such interest for the satisfaction of any liability or claim against Landlord under this Lease, it being specifically agreed that in no event whatsoever shall Landlord (which term shall include, without limitation, any general or limited partner, trustees, beneficiaries, officers, directors, or stockholders of Landlord) ever be personally liable for any such liability.
10.4
                          
Limitation of Landlord's Liability.
 
  In any case where either party hereto is required to do any act, delays caused by or resulting from Acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire, flood or other casualty, labor difficulties, shortages of labor, materials or equipment, government regulations, unusually severe weather, or other causes beyond such party's reasonable control (any of the foregoing causes being referred to herein as "Force Majeure") shall not be counted in determining the time during which work shall be completed, whether such time be designated by a fixed date, a fixed time or a "reasonable time," and such time shall be deemed to be extended by the period of such delay.  No event shall constitute "Force Majeure" unless the party invoking the benefit of this Section 10.5 advises the other party of the occurrence of the alleged Force Majeure event
10.5
                          
Force Majeure.
 
within 5 business days after such party's awareness of the occurrence of such event.
 
  A.  Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder unless it shall fail to perform such obligations and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default after written notice has been given by Tenant to Landlord (with copies of such notice delivered simultaneously to all mortgagees of which Tenant has notice) specifying the nature of Landlord's alleged default.  Landlord shall not be liable in any event for incidental or consequential damages to Tenant by reason of Landlord's default, whether or not notice is given.  Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any default by Landlord hereunder and no right, for any such default, to offset or counterclaim against any rent due hereunder, except as expressly provided below.
10.6
                          
Landlord's Default.
 
If Landlord fails, after the expiration of the cure periods specified in Paragraph (A) above, to cure any default, Tenant may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Landlord captioned "NOTICE  SELF-HELP REMEDY TO BE INVOKED" advising Landlord that Tenant intends to exercise its self-help rights under this Section 10.6, undertake to cure any default by Landlord under this Lease relating to the Premises and/or building systems exclusively serving the Premises, provided however, that Tenant shall not have the right to cure any such default to the extent that such cure would relate to (i) areas outside of the Premises, or (ii) the structure or mechanical or life safety systems of the Building.  Whenever Tenant so elects to cure a default by Landlord as set forth herein, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's written demand (which shall include reasonably detailed supporting documentation), reimburse Tenant for all costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in curing a default; provided, however, Landlord shall only be responsible for the incremental cost in excess of the cost that would ordinarily be part of Operating Costs under this Lease, if applicable.  If Landlord fails to make any payment to Tenant as and when due, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity, Tenant shall have the right to offset such owed amounts against its payments of Fixed Rent coming due under this Lease; provided, however, that the amount of each such monthly offset shall not exceed twenty (20%) percent of the monthly installment of Fixed Rent then payable as stipulated under Section 1.1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord has undertaken curative action (which may include providing Tenant with a remedial plan and timetable for rectifying the default) and is proceeding with diligence, but has been unable to fully complete such cure by the expiration of thirty (30) days from Tenant's first notice of such default, Landlord shall be afforded a reasonable time thereafter in which to complete its curative efforts before Tenant may effect a cure.  If Tenant elects to exercise self-help under this Section 10.6, then Tenant may not avail itself of any other remedy at law or in equity.
B.           
 
  Each of Landlord and Tenant warrants and represents that it has dealt with no broker in connection with the consummation of this Lease, other than the Broker (which is Tenant's broker), and each agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless from and against any and all loss, cost, damage, claim or expense resulting from the breach of the foregoing warranty.  Landlord shall pay Broker pursuant to a separate agreement.  Jones, Lang LaSalle ("Landlord's Broker") is representing Landlord with respect to the leases for the other Avid Spaces (i.e., the Building 75 Lease and the Building 65 Lease).  Although Landlord's Broker's involvement in the Building 65 Lease and the Building 75 Lease has covered some matters common to all leases for the Avid Spaces, the parties have not dealt directly with Landlord's Broker in consummating this Lease.  Landlord shall pay Landlord's Broker pursuant to a separate agreement relating to the leases for the other Avid Spaces.  Tenant shall have no liability for any amounts due Broker, nor for claims, if any, by Landlord's Broker in connection with this Lease.
10.7

4.             If Mortgagee succeeds to the interest of Landlord or any successor to Landlord, Mortgagee shall not be:
 
(a)           liable for any act, omission, warranty or representation of any prior landlord (including, but not limited to, Landlord) in connection with or arising out of the Lease;
 
(b)           liable for the return of any security deposits held pursuant to the Lease, except to the extent any such security deposits are transferred to Mortgagee;
 
(c)           bound by any rent or additional rent which Tenant might have paid for more than the then current month to any prior landlord (including, but not limited to, Landlord); or
(d)           bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without Mortgagee's consent.
 
In no event shall Mortgagee have any personal liability as successor to Landlord and Tenant shall look only to the estate and property of Mortgagee in and to the Mortgaged Property for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies for the collection of a judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment of money in the event of any default by Mortgagee as landlord under the Lease, and no other property or assets of Mortgagee shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies under or with respect to the Lease.
 
5.             Tenant acknowledges having been notified that Landlord's interest in and to the Lease has been assigned to Mortgagee pursuant to the Assignment of Leases and Rents and that Landlord has been granted the license to collect all rent and other amounts payable under the Lease (collectively, ""), provided no Event of Default exists under, and as defined in, the Mortgage.  Tenant further acknowledges that if an Event of Default shall exist, Mortgagee has the right, power and authority to direct Tenant to make payment of all Rent directly to Mortgagee or its agents and agrees that upon such direction Tenant shall make such payment of Rent to Mortgagee or its agents in accordance with the written direction of Mortgagee. By its signature below, Landlord unconditionally authorizes and directs Tenant to make rental payments directly to Mortgagee following receipt of such notice from Mortgagee and Landlord further agrees that Tenant may rely upon such notice without any obligation to further inquire as to whether or not any Event of Default exists under the Mortgage or the Assignment and notwithstanding any notice from or claim of Landlord to the contrary.  Landlord shall have no right or claim against Tenant for or by reason of any payments of rent or other charges made by Tenant to Mortgagee following Tenant's receipt of any such notice. Until further notice from Mortgagee, however, Tenant will continue to make all payments under the Lease to Landlord and otherwise look solely to Landlord for the performance of the lessor's obligations under the Lease.
Rent
 
6.             So long as the Mortgage is in effect, Tenant will not, without Mortgagee's prior written consent, (i) agree to any adjustment, modification, supplement or amendment to, the Lease, (ii) pay any rent under the Lease more than one (1) month in advance, or (iii) agree to any termination, cancellation or surrender of the Lease.  Tenant will allow Mortgagee's employees and representatives to inspect the Demised Premises from time to time upon reasonable advance notice.
 
7.             Tenant agrees to send a copy of all notices of default under the Lease to the Mortgagee at the address provided herein.
 
8.             Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be given or delivered:  (i) by United States mail, registered or certified, postage fully prepaid, return receipt requested, or (ii) by recognized courier service or recognized overnight delivery service; and in any event addressed to the party for which it is intended at its address set forth below:
 
 
or such other address as such party may have previously specified by notice given or delivered in accordance with the foregoing.   Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given and received on the date delivered or tendered for delivery during normal business hours as herein provided.
 
9.             Tenant shall afford Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure any defaults of Landlord under the Lease (not to exceed 60 days more than the cure period as provided to Landlord under the Lease), and upon request by Mortgagee from time to time shall provide Mortgagee with an estoppel certificate covering such matters as Mortgagee shall reasonably request.  Mortgagee's cure of Landlord's default shall not be considered an assumption by Mortgagee of Landlord's other obligations under the Lease.  If Mortgagee or any successor or assign becomes obligated to perform as landlord under the Lease, Mortgagee or such successor or assign will be released from such
Lease obligations when such person or entity assigns, sells or otherwise transfers its interest in the Premises or the Property.
 
10.           This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, Tenant, Landlord, Mortgagee and the successors and assigns of each.
 
11.           This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute and be construed as one and the same instrument.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement the day and year first above written.

EXHIBIT 99.1      
 
 
 
 Avid ( today reported revenues of $174.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2009, compared to $206.7 million for the same period in 2008. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $17.9 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $100.3 million, or $2.71 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
TEWKSBURY, Mass., January 28, 2010
NASDAQ: AVID)
 
The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 included amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition related costs, net gains from divested product lines and related tax adjustments, collectively totaling $16.5 million. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $1.4 million for the fourth quarter, or $0.04 per share.

Excluding these items, the non-GAAP operating profit was $2.0 million for the fourth quarter.
Avid has made good progress this quarter.  Our revenues were up sequentially and we believe our markets are stabilizing with some signs of recovery, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO at Avid. We reported a non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter and with the majority of our cost structure transformation complete we feel we are well positioned for margin expansion.
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $629.0 million, compared to revenues of $844.9 million for 2008. GAAP net loss for 2009 was $68.4 million, or $1.83 per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $198.2 million, or $5.28 per share for 2008. GAAP net loss for 2009 included $55.7 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition related costs, net gains from divested product lines and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $12.7 million or $0.34 per share for 2009. GAAP net loss for 2008 included $172.9 million of amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, net gains from divested product lines, impairment charges and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $25.2 million or $0.67 per share for 2008.
The companys cash balance on December 31, 2009 was $109 million, or approximately $2.91 per share.
 
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The reconciliation for operating income (loss), net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are in the tables attached to this press release.
The company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to manage its business, for example, in establishing its annual operating budget, in assessing segment operating performance and for measuring performance under employee incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the companys ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate the companys current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the companys use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect the companys operations. The companys management compensates for these limitations by considering the companys financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.

A conference call to discuss Avids fourth quarter 2009 financial results will be held today, January 28, 2010 at 4:30 p.m. ET.

On February 8, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) adopted the Companys 2010 Executive Bonus Plan (the Plan). The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan. All of the Companys executive officers, with limited exceptions, are eligible to participate in the Plan.
 
Under the Plan, each participant is assigned a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of his or her base salary paid in 2009. Each executive officers cash bonus target is a fixed dollar amount ranging from 60% to 100% of such executive officers base salary, with the exception of the Senior Vice President of Sales and Professional Services.  His cash bonus target under the Plan is less than 60% because a portion of his cash incentive compensation is also tied to sales commissions.
 
Bonus payouts under the Plan will be based 80% on the financial performance of the Company and 20% on each executives personal performance. The financial metrics and relative weights for company performance under the Plan are as follows: company revenues (40%) and company operating earnings (60%). Actual performance of company financial metrics will be determined on a non-GAAP basis consistent with historical company practice.  Examples of personal performance objectives include achievement of company financial metrics, revenue bookings, and key product and project deliveries.
 
The Companys performance relative to each of its financial metrics will receive a score ranging from 0.00 to 1.50. Each participants performance relative to his or her personal goals will receive a score ranging from 0.00 to 1.35. In both cases, a score of 1.00 represents a target performance level. These scores will be used in a weighted average formula to calculate each participants overall bonus score, which will be multiplied by each participants target bonus amount to determine his or her actual bonus payout for 2010. Bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2011 after the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but in no event later than December 31, 2011. Each participant must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2010 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company has an operating loss for 2010, all bonus payouts under the Plan will be reduced to zero.
Nothing in the Plan limits the discretion of the Board or the Committee to approve and pay out additional or alternative bonuses to participants based on performance or provide participants additional or alternative incentives outside of the terms of the Plan.
The preceding description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
 
2
 
On February 9, 2010, the Board adopted an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated By-Laws (as amended, the Amended By-Laws).  The amendment amends and restates Article I, Section 1.9 to provide that, in the election of directors, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee exceed the votes cast against such nominee; provided, that if, as of the tenth day preceding the date of the Companys first notice to stockholders of a meeting of stockholders, the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting, then each director shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast.  Prior to this amendment, each director was elected by a plurality of votes cast regardless of the number of nominees to be elected.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the marked copy of the Amended By-Laws, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The Performance Components have been assigned weights for purposes of calculating bonus payouts, in accordance with the following table:
Performance Component

achievement of these performance levels as set forth in the following table:
 
 
The scores attached to each Company Metric will be used in the following formula, which incorporates the weight of each Company Metric, to determine the :
Company Performance Score

Our year-on-year first quarter revenue increase is a positive sign not only for the growth of Avids business, but the industry-at-large, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO at Avid. We saw some positive momentum at NAB and are excited about the possibilities our new products and the acquisition of Euphonix will play in the future success of our business and our customers businesses.
The companys cash balance on March 31, 2010 was $74.2 million, or almost $2.00 per share.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we provide is in the tables attached to this press release.
We consider both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management, and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, non-GAAP operating net loss and non-GAAP operating loss, do not have standardized meanings. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.

The Avid Europe facility will become available upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  The borrowing availability under the Credit Facilities is based on the lesser of (i) the foregoing commitments for the Company and Avid Europe, as applicable, and (ii) a borrowing base which is a percentage of the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company or Avid Europe, as applicable.

In addition, Avid Europe has granted liens on substantially all of its assets to secure its obligations as borrower under its portion of the Credit Facilities.  General Partner has provided a guarantee and liens on substantially all of its assets to secure the obligations of Avid Europe under the Credit Facilities.

The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain liquidity (comprised of unused availability under the Companys portion of the Credit Facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) of $10 million, at least $5 million of which must be from unused availability under the Companys portion of the Credit Facilities.  Avid Europe is required to maintain liquidity (comprised of unused availability under Avid Europes portion of the Credit Facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) of $5 million, at least $2.5 million of which must be from unused availability under Avid Europes portion of the Credit Facilities.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, mandatory prepayments, and events of default under which the Borrowers payment obligations may be accelerated.

(b)
 
.  In the case of a request for an Advance and so long as either (i) the aggregate amount of Swing Loans made since the last Settlement Date, minus the amount of Collections or payments applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the amount of the requested Advance does not exceed $6,000,000, or (ii) Swing Lender, in its sole discretion, shall agree to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, Swing Lender shall make an Advance in the amount of such requested Borrowing (any such Advance made solely by Swing Lender pursuant to this S ection 2.2(b) being referred to individually each, as a Swing Loan and all such Advances being referred to collectively, as Swing Loans) available to Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds to the Designated Account.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Swing Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, make Swing Loans at any time that one or more of the Lenders is a Defaulting Lender.  Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be an Advance hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including Section 3) applicable to other Advances; , , all payments on any Swing Loan shall be payable to Swing Lender solely for its own account.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(d)(ii), Swing Lender shall not make and shall not be obligated to make any Swing Loan if Swing Lender has actual knowledge that (A) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing, or (B) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.  Swing Lender shall not otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making any Swing Loan.  The Swing Loans shall be secured by Agents Liens, constitute Advances and Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base Rate Loans.

Making of Loans
 
(i)
 
In the event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then promptly after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2(a), Agent shall notify the Lenders, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the Funding Date applicable thereto, by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing.  Each Lender shall make the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agents Account, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Funding Date applicable thereto.  After Agents receipt of the proceeds of such Advances, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account; , , , subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(d)(ii), Agent shall not request any Lender to make, and no Lender shall have the obligation to make, any Advance if (A) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (B) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.
provided

(ii)
 
Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 12:00 noon on the date of a Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount.  If any Lender shall not have made its full amount available to Agent in immediately available funds and if Agent in such circumstances has made available to Borrowers such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount available to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day during such period.  A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.2(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If such amount is so made available, such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lenders Advance on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.  If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agents account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicab le at the time to the Advances composing such Borrowing.  The failure of any Lender to make any Advance on any Funding Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make an Advance on such Funding Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make an Advance to be made by such other Lender on any Funding Date.

Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances
 
(i)
 
Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in Agents sole discretion, (A) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied, to make Advances to, or for the benefit of, Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders (in an aggregate amount for all such Advances taken together not exceeding $6,000,000 outstanding at any one time) that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) (any of the Advances described in this Section 2.2(d)(i) shall be referred to as Protective Advances).
 
(ii)
 
Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Advances (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or thereby would be created, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Advances, the outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by more than , (B) after giving effect to such Advances, the outstanding US Revolver Usage (excep t for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum US Revolver Amount, (C) after giving effect to such Advances, the outstanding Irish Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Irish Revolver Amount, and (D) after giving effect to such Advances, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.  In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the US Revolver Usage, Irish Revolver Usage or Revolver Usage, as applicable, exceeds the amounts permitted by the immediately foregoing provisions, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Advances to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence.  In such circumstances, if any Lender objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders.  In any event: (1) if any unintentional Overadvance remains outstanding for more than thirty (30) days, unless otherwise agreed to by the Required Lenders, Borrowers sh all immediately repay Advances in an amount sufficient to eliminate all such unintentional Overadvances, and (2) after the date all such Overadvances have been eliminated, there must be at least five (5) consecutive days before intentional Overadvances are made.  The foregoing provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent and are not meant for the benefit of Borrowers which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.5.  Each Lender shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided in Section 2.2(e) (or Section 2.2(g), as applicable) for the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.2(d)(ii), and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses.

(iii)
 
Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance shall be deemed to be an Advance hereunder; , , no Protective Advance or Overadvance shall be eligible to be a LIBOR Rate Loan and, prior to Settlement therefor, all payments on the Protective Advances shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account.  The Protective Advances and Overadvances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Agents Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base Rate Loans.  The ability of Agent to make Protective Advances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Overadvances and its ability to make Overadvances is separate and distinct from its ability to make Protective Advances.  For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on Agents ability to make Protective Advances do not apply to Overadvances and the limitations on Agents ability to make Overadvances do not apply to Protective Advances.  The provisions of this Section 2.2(d) are for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers in any way.
except
that
 
(e)
 
.  It is agreed that each Lenders funded portion of the Advances is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Advances.  Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Advances, the Swing Loans, and the Protective Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:
Settlement
 
(i)
 
Agent shall request settlement () with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent (A) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (B) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Protective Advances, and (C) with respect to Borrowers Collections or payments received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settl ement (the date of such requested Settlement being the ).  Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Advances, Swing Loans, and Protective Advances for the period since the prior Settlement Date.  Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.2(g)):  (1) if the outstanding amount of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender exceeds such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) as of a Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 3:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlemen t Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances), and (2) if the outstanding amount of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) made by a Lender is less than such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall no later than 3:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to Agents Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances).  Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (2) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Protective Advances and, together with the portion of such Swing Loans or Protective Advances representing Swing Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Advances of such Lenders.  If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.

(ii)
 
In determining whether a Lenders balance of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Protective Advances is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Protective Advances as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral.
 
(iii)
 
Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Protective Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any Collections or payments received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Advances, for application to the Protective Advances or Swing Loans.  Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Protective Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any Collections or payments received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Advances, for application to S wing Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Advances.  If, as of any Settlement Date, Collections or payments of any Borrower received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Advances other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the provisions of Section 2.2(g)), to be applied to the outstanding Advances of such Lenders, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances.  During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Protective Advances, and each Lender (subject to the effect of agreements between Agent and individual Lenders) with respect to the Advances other than Swing Loans and Prot ective Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable.
 
(iv)
 
Anything in this Section 2.2(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall be entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.2(g).
 
(f)
 
.  Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the principal amount of the Advances owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to Swing Lender, and Protective Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of each Lender, from time to time and such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate.

Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lenders benefit or any Collections or proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments (i) , to Swing Lender to the extent of any Swing Loans that were made by Swing Lender and that were required to be, but were not, repaid by the Defaulting Lender, (ii) , to the Issuing Lender, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, repaid by the Defaulting Lender, (iii) , to each non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case,

proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Advances (or other funding obligations) hereunder (provided any amounts in such suspense account will be treated as if the applicable Advance by such Defaulting Lender had been paid in such amount and no interest or fees shall be payable on such amount), and (v) , from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (L) of Section 2.3(b)(ii).  Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lend er the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender.  Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section 2.10(b), such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and such Lenders Commitment shall be deemed to be zero.

Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Rate
 
(i)
 
The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs, in each case, due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in tax laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor), which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate.  In any such event, the affected Lender shall give Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, may, by notice to such affected Lender     (A) require such Lender to furnish to Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.11(b)(ii)).
 
(ii)
 
In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Agent and Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (A) in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lenders notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (B) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.

Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable within thirty (30) days after presentation by such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail such Lenders calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error).  ; In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; , , Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any reductions in return incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers, of such law, rule, regulation or guideline giving rise to such reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; , , , if such claim arises by reason of the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or guideline that is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(iv)
 
if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because such Lender or Participant serves as an intermediary, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY (with proper attachments); or

(v)
 
a properly completed and executed copy of any other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as may be required under the IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding or backup withholding tax.

(d)
 
If a Lender or Participant claims an exemption from withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than the United States, such Lender or such Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrowers, to deliver to Agent and Administrative Loan Party (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its first (1) payment under this Agreement, but only if such Lender or su ch Participant is legally able to deliver such forms, , , , nothing in this Section 16(d) shall require a Lender or Participant to disclose any information that it deems to be confidential (including, without limitation, its tax returns).

If a Lender or a Participant is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender or such Participant an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such reduction.  If the forms or other documentation required by Section 16(c) or 16(d) are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

(g)
 
If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the participation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for a ny other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and hold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this Section 16, together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses).  The obligation of the Lenders and the Participants under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent.
 
(h)
 
If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrowers or with respect to which Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, it shall pay over such refund to Administrative Loan Party, on behalf of Borrowers (but only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrowers under this Section 16 with respect to Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the rel evant Governmental Authority with respect to such a refund); , , Borrowers, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over to Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest or other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent hereunder) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

.  Each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting.  Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its agent and to h ave accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents; it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of each Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Providers being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not.  In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution.  Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the relevant Bank Product Provider.  In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the relevant Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof).  Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although each Borrower is no t required to do so. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.

.  The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and Loan Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor.  No member of the Lender Group has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and Loan Parties, on the other hand, by virtue of any Lo an Document or any transaction contemplated therein.

We are pleased to report our strongest financial quarter since 2007 including a non-GAAP operating profit and strong year-over-year revenue growth,said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO at Avid.  The steady revenue growth trend in both Avids business and our customers businesses is encouraging and we remain focused on improving our profit margin.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we provide is in the tables attached to this press release.
We consider both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business.  Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitat ions associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income, do not have standardized meanings.  Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.   We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.

On December 6, 2010, Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) committed to a restructuring plan designed to better align financial and human resources in accordance with its strategic plans for the upcoming fiscal year.  In connection with the restructuring, the Company intends to eliminate positions that are in lower growth geographies and markets and reinvest in more strategic areas with greater opportunity for growth.  The plan also calls for streamlining internal operations while making key investments in organizational efficiencies and to close portions of certain office facilities.  The Company expects to incur $10 to $12 million in severance costs relating to the elimination of positions and about $4 million relating to the closure of the office facilities.   The Company expects to record the majority of these charges in the quarter ending December 31, 2010 and anticipates that it will complete the restructuring in the first half of 2011.  All of the charges described herein represent cash expenditures, the majority of which will occur in 2011.
 
 
 
On November 11, 2010, the Company provided guidance with respect to its financial results for 2010 and 2011, which guidance included an estimate for costs that were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.  The Companys commitment to the restructuring plan as described in Item 2.05 above is consistent with such prior guidance, however, the commitment to this restructuring plan changes the timing of the assumption in the original guidance announcement such that a portion of the costs will move from 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2010.  The costs for 2010 are expected to include an additional $6 to $7 million as a result of this timing change, but the aggregate estimate of the GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income for 2010 and 2011 is unchanged.
 
For purposes of providing investors with an understanding of our future business model, the Company is providing forward-looking analysis on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial measures are not, however, available on a forward-looking basis and comparable future GAAP financial measures could be materially different.

EXHIBIT 99.1 
 
 
 
 
 
 Avid ( today reported revenues of $195.3 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2010, compared to $174.7 million for the same period in 2009. The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter was $571 thousand, or $0.01 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $17.9 million, or $0.48 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
BURLINGTON, MA., February 4, 2011
NASDAQ: AVID)
The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 included amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, gains on asset sales, acquisition-related costs and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $14.8 million and $16.5 million, respectively. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $14.2 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2009.
We are pleased to end 2010 on a positive note with year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter and for the year, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO at Avid.  Our return to non-GAAP net income for 2010 is a significant milestone in the transformation of the business and we feel well positioned from a product and financial standpoint as we move into 2011.
Revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010 were $678.5 million, compared to revenues of $629.0 million for the same period in 2009. GAAP net loss for 2010 was $37.0 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $68.4 million, or $1.83 per share, for 2009. GAAP net loss for 2010 and 2009 included amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, gains on asset sales, acquisition-related costs, a legal settlement and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $46.2 million and $55.7 million, respectively.  Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for 2010 was $9.2 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $12.7 million, or $0.34 per share, for 2009.
GAAP operating loss for 2010 was $36.2 million including amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, a gain on asset sales, acquisition-related costs and a legal settlement collectively totaling $49.8 million.  Excluding these items, our non-GAAP operating profit for 2010 was $13.6 million or 2% of revenue.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables attached to this release.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we provide is in the tables attached to this press release.
We consider both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business.  Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performanc e. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income, do not have standardized meanings.  Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.   We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avids fourth quarter 2010 financial results will be held today, February 4, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. EDT. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing 719.457.2617 and referencing confirmation code 4569475. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avids website.

On February 16, 2011, the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) determined that the Companys 2011 annual meeting of stockholders will be held on June 10, 2011 in Burlington, Massachusetts.  The record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be April 11, 2011.  The date of the 2011 annual meeting will be more than 30 days following the anniversary of the 2010 annual meeting.
 
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, stockholders may present proposals for inclusion in the Companys proxy statement for the 2011 annual meeting by submitting their proposals to the Company a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send its proxy materials. The Companys Board of Directors has set the deadline for receipt of stockholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 as March 18, 2011.  In order for a proposal under Rule 14a-8 to be considered timely, it must be received by the Company on or prior to March 18, 2011 at the Companys principal executive offices at 75 Network Drive, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 and be directed to the attention of the Companys Secretary.  All stockholder proposals must be in compliance with ap plicable laws and regulations in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2011 annual meeting.
 
Under the Companys bylaws, if a stockholder intends to present a proposal at the Companys 2011 annual meeting, but not include that proposal in the Companys proxy statement, the proposal must be submitted to the Company Secretary at the Companys principal offices in Massachusetts no later than April 11, 2011, which is the 60th day prior to the date of the 2011 annual meeting.  The Companys by-laws specify requirements relating to the content of the notice that stockholders must provide.
 
 
 
On February 11, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Companys 2011 Executive Bonus Plan (the Plan). The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan. All of the Companys officers, with limited exceptions, are eligible to participate in the Plan.
 
Under the Plan, each participant is assigned a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of his or her base salary paid in 2011. Each officers cash bonus target is a fixed dollar amount ranging from 40% to 100% of such officers base salary.
 
 
 
 
Bonus payouts under the Plan will be based 80% on the financial performance of the Company and 20% on each officers personal performance. The financial metrics and relative weights for Company performance under the Plan are as follows: Company revenues (50%) and Company operating earnings (50%). Actual performance of Company financial metrics will be determined on a non-GAAP basis consistent with historical Company practice.  Examples of personal performance objectives include achievement of specified levels of Company financial metrics, achievement of a specified level of revenue bookings, improved performance in key strategic areas and key project deliveries.
 
The Companys performance relative to each of its financial metrics will receive a score ranging from 0.00 to 1.50. Each participants performance relative to his or her personal goals will receive a score ranging from 0.00 to 1.35. In both cases, a score of 1.00 represents a target performance level. These scores will be used in a weighted average formula to calculate each participants overall bonus score, which will be multiplied by each participants target bonus amount to determine his or her actual bonus payout for 2011. Bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined and paid in the first quarter of 2012. Each participant must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2011 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Company has a non-GAA P operating loss for 2011, all bonus payouts under the Plan will be reduced to zero.
 
Nothing in the Plan limits the discretion of the Board of Directors or the Committee to approve and pay out additional or alternative bonuses to the Companys officers based on performance or provide the Companys officers additional or alternative incentives outside of the terms of the Plan.
 
The preceding description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

This quarter represented the third consecutive quarter that we achieved a non-GAAP operating profit.  With a number of new products now in the market, and a Q1 non-GAAP operating profit for the first time since 2007, we are off to a solid start for the year.
The GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2011 was $3.4 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we provide is in the tables attached to this press release.
 
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business.  Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net loss, do not have  standardized meanings.  Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.   We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.
 
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The contents of this release are subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that relate to future results or events are forward-looking statements and are based on Avids current estimates and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, may, plan, feel, should, will, and would, or similar expressions. Actual results and events in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: Avids ability to execute on its corporate strategy and meet customer needs, including the ability to produce innovative products in response to changing market demand; general economic conditions and conditions within the rapidly evolving media industry specifically; competitive factors; fluctuations in Avids revenues, based on, among other things, Avids performance in particular geographies; and other risk factors and uncertainties disclosed previously and from time to time in Avids filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avids estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the companys estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 7 hereof, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

Section 9. 
Voting
.  Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, or permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation's shares are listed and traded, any question brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes cast on the question, voting as a single class.  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to Section 12 of this Article II, each stockholder represented at a meeting of the stockholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder.  Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in Section 10 of this Article II.  The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in such officer's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.  Other than in a Contested Election Meeting (as defined below), a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominees election exceed the votes cast against such nominees election (with abstentions, broker non-votes and withheld votes not counted as a vote for or against such nominees election).  In a Contested Election Meeting, when a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at such Contested Election Meeting.  If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.  A meeting of stockholders shall be a Contested Election Meeting if there are more persons nominated for election as directors at such meeting than there are directors to be elected at such meeting, determined as of the tenth day preceding the date of the corporations first notice to stockholders of such meeting sent pursuant to Section 6 of this Article II (the Determination Date); provided, however, that if in accordance with Section 5 of this Article II stockholders are entitled to nominate persons for election as director during a period of time that ends after the otherwise applicable Determination Date, the Determination Date shall instead be as of the end of such period. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
 
Section 10. 
Proxies
.  Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.  Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:
 
(i)
 
A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(ii)
 
A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.  If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information on which they relied.
 
7
 
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
Section 11. 
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote
.  The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation.  In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
 
Section 12. 
.  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Section 13.

Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following:  (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the Corporation.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability.  The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by applicable law.
 
 
 
 
Section 1. 
Number and Election of Directors
.  The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than fifteen members, the exact number of which shall be fixed from time to time by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office.  The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that Annual Meeting shall be elected for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class or from the removal from office, death, disability, resignation or disqualification of a director or other cause shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors have the effect of removing or shortening the term of any incumbent director.  Directors need not be stockholders.

Section 2. 
Vacancies
.  Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.  Any director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors of such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class.  Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission if consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.

Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders or any regular or special meeting of the directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we provide is in the tables attached to this press release.
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business.  Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net income, do not have  standardized meanings.  Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.   We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The contents of this release are subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release includes forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that relate to future results or events are forward-looking statements and are based on Avids current estimates and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, may, plan, feel, could, will, and would, or similar expressions. Actual results and events in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: Avids ability to execute on its corporate strategy and meet customer needs, including the ability to produce innovative products in response to changing market demand; competitive factors; fluctuations in Avids revenues, based on, among other things, Avids performance in particular geographies; general economic conditions and conditions within the rapidly evolving media industry specifically; and other risk factors and uncertainties disclosed previously and from time to time in Avids filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avids estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the companys estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): February 23, 2012
AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.
(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
 
On February 23, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Avid Technology, Inc. (Avid or the Company) approved Avid's 2012 Executive Bonus Plan (the Executive Bonus Plan). The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Executive Bonus Plan. All of the Company's executive officers and certain other officers designated by the Committee, with limited exceptions, are eligible to participate in the Executive Bonus Plan.
 
Under the Executive Bonus Plan, each participant is assigned a bonus percentage of his or her base salary paid in 2012, ranging from 35% to 100% of such participant's base salary. A participant's target bonus amount is equal to the participant's bonus percentage multiplied by the participant's base salary paid to him or her in 2012.
 
Expected bonus payouts under the Executive Bonus Plan will initially be based 80% on the financial performance of the Company and 20% on each participant's personal performance. The financial metrics for Company performance under the Executive Bonus Plan are Company revenues and Company operating earnings, with both metrics assigned equal weight. Actual performance of Company financial metrics will be determined on a non-GAAP basis consistent with historical Company practice.  Examples of personal performance objectives include achievement of specified levels of Company financial metrics, achievement of company-wide strategic initiatives, key product deliveries and key project deliveries. Each participant's performance relative to his or her personal goals will be determined by the Committee, in its discretion, on a numerical basis. These scores will be used in a weighted average formula to calculate each participant's overall bonus score, which will be multiplied by each participant's target bonus amount to determine his or her expected bonus payout for 2012. The Committee may determine a bonus payout for any participant that is less than or more than the expected amount determined in accordance with the formula in the Executive Bonus Plan; provided, however, a participant's actual bonus payout may not exceed two times his or her target bonus amount (a participant's Capped Amount). The Committee may make its bonus amount determinations on a participant by participant basis and need not treat participants uniformly.
The Committee will review the Company's actual performance relative to each of its two financial metrics and assign a score ranging from zero to 2.00. A Company performance score of 1.00 represents target performance level. The Company performance score for each financial metric is then assigned equal weight to determine the overall Company performance score. The overall Company performance score is then multiplied by the target bonus amount for each participant and then these amounts are aggregated to determine the recommended bonus pool. The Committee will determine the sufficiency of the recommended bonus pool in view of each participant's personal performance score and will establish the final bonus pool, provided that the final bonus pool shall not exceed the sum of all participants' Capped Amounts.
Bonuses, if any, will be determined and paid by March 15, 2013. Each participant must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2012 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under the Executive Bonus Plan unless otherwise provided in such participant's employment agreement, offer letter or other agreement.
If, during 2012, a corporate transaction or event occurs that the Committee determines has or would distort the applicable performance criteria, the Committee may adjust the calculation of the performance goals to the extent necessary to prevent a reduction or enlargement of a participant's actual bonus payout.
 
Nothing in the Executive Bonus Plan limits the authority of the Board of Directors or the Committee to approve and pay out additional or alternative bonuses to the Company's officers based on performance or provide the Company's officers additional or alternative incentives outside of the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan.

2012 EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN
On February 23, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the 
Committee
) of the Board of Directors (the 
Board
) of Avid Technology, Inc. (the 
Company
) adopted this 2012 Executive Bonus Plan (the 
Plan
).
The purpose of this Plan is: (i) to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate certain Company officers, and (ii) to reward such officers for their contributions toward the achievement of certain Company financial goals and their personal performance in 2012. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term 
Company
, as used in this Plan, includes any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.
The Committee will administer and have final authority on all matters relating to the Plan, except as otherwise set forth herein. The Committee may interpret and construe the Plan, decide any and all matters arising under or in connection with the Plan, and correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent it deems expedient to implement the Plan. Additionally, the Committee may amend, suspend, revoke or terminate the Plan at any time. All bonus payouts under the Plan are subject to prior approval by the Committee. All decisions by the Committee will be made in the Committee's sole discretion and will be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan.
All of the Company's executive officers and certain other officers designated by the Committee (collectively, officers) will be eligible to participate in the Plan; provided, however, that officers hired after September 30, 2012 will be eligible to participate in the Plan at the discretion of the Committee. Eligible officers must be employed by the Company on December 31, 2012 in order to receive a bonus, if any, under this Plan, unless otherwise provided in an employment agreement, offer letter or other similar agreement between the officer and the Company. An eligible officer who ceases to be employed by the Company, other than as a result of termination by the Company for cause, after December 31, 2012, but prior to the bonus payout date, will be entitled to receive a bonus pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan. For purposes of the Plan, the following individuals will be deemed to be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2012: (i) any officer on an approved leave of absence on that date, and (ii) any officer who in 2012 becomes disabled and qualifies for benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan. For individuals who become officers of the Company during 2012 as a result of an acquisition, initial eligibility for participation in the Plan will be determined by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. Each eligible officer is deemed a 
Participant
 in the Plan.
1
Each Participant has been designated by the Company as being eligible to earn a target bonus amount equal to a percentage of the Participant's base salary (the 
Bonus Percentage
).
Each Participant's 
Target Bonus Amount
 for 2012 is his or her Bonus Percentage multiplied by the base salary paid to him or her in 2012. For purposes of the Plan, base salary includes regular wages and vacation, sick time and holiday pay, but not leave of absence, bonus or other premium pay.
Expected bonus payouts will initially be based on the following two components: Company Performance and Personal Performance (each referred to as a 
Performance Component
). Each Performance Component is described in greater detail in Section 6. The Performance Components have been assigned the following weights:
For each Company Metric, the Committee will establish a minimum performance level, a target performance level and a maximum performance level. Each Company Metric will receive a score based upon achievement of these performance levels as set forth in the following table:
2
The scores attached to each Company Metric will be used in the following formula, which incorporates the weight of each Company Metric, to determine the 
Company Performance Score
:
The Committee, within a reasonable period of time after December 31, 2012, will then determine, in its discretion, each Participant's performance relative to each goal on a numerical basis (a 
Personal Performance Score
).
Each Participant will be assigned an 
Overall Score
 that will be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth below:
(Target Bonus Amount) x (Overall Score) = Expected Bonus Payout
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine an actual bonus payout for any Participant that is less than the amount determined in accordance with the foregoing formula or zero with respect to such Participant or, taking into account such factors as the Committee determines appropriate in its sole discretion, determine an actual bonus payout that exceeds the expected bonus payout calculated above, but not beyond two times the Participant's
Target Bonus Amount (a Participant's Capped Amount). The Committee may make its determination on a Participant by Participant basis and need not treat Participants uniformly. A Participant who is eligible for a bonus payout does not earn a bonus payout until the Committee makes any and all final determinations as authorized by the Plan.

Avid Provides Preliminary First Quarter 2012 Results
BURLINGTON, MA- April 11, 2012-
Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported certain preliminary financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012.
Avid's first quarter results are preliminary and subject to change. Avid currently plans to announce final results for the first quarter on April 26, 2012.
The company currently expects revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2012 to be approximately $152 million. First quarter revenues were negatively impacted by weaker demand in the creative enthusiast portion of the company's business, with revenues down approximately 30 percent compared to the first quarter of 2011. Revenues for the remainder of the business were down modestly compared to last year.
The GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2012 is currently expected to be approximately $15 million. The GAAP operating loss includes charges for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition-related costs totaling approximately $7 million. Excluding these charges, the company currently expects to report a non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $8 million for the first quarter of 2012.
 
The company also reported that it ended the March 31, 2012 quarter with a cash balance of approximately $50 million and no bank debt outstanding.
Avid will hold a conference call on April 26 at 4:30 p.m. (EDT) to review its financial results in more detail for the first quarter of 2012. The call will follow the dissemination of the company's press release on those results.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, terms referring to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release, such as non-GAAP operating loss, do not have standardized meanings. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The financial results included in this release are unaudited. The contents of this release are preliminary and subject to change. This release may include forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that relate to future results or events are forward-looking statements and are based on Avid's current estimates and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, may, plan, feel, could, will, and would, or similar expressions. Actual results and events in future periods and for the quarter ended
March 31, 2012 may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: accounting and other adjustments that may be made to the preliminary financial results; Avid's ability to execute its strategic plan and meet customer needs; its ability to produce innovative products in response to changing market demand, particularly in the media industry; competitive factors; fluctuations in its revenue, based on, among other things, Avid's performance in particular geographies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and seasonal factors, such as higher consumer demand at year-end; adverse changes in economic conditions; Avid's liquidity; and other risk factors and uncertainties disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Avid Announces Results for First Quarter 2012
 
BURLINGTON, MA- April 26, 2012-
Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported revenues of $152.1 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to $166.3 million for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $15.6 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.13 per share, in the first quarter of 2011. These results are preliminary and are subject to Avid's completion of its review of a recently identified tax matter described below.
The GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 included amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition and other costs for 2012 only and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $6.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2012 was $9.4 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $840 thousand, or $0.02 per share, for the first quarter of 2011.
The GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2012 was $15.2 million and excluding the items identified above, except tax adjustments, the non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter was $8.5 million. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables attached to this release.
While revenues were down from last year primarily related to the creative enthusiast portion of our business, we see positive signs in the post and professional and our media enterprise markets as customers seek to become more competitive by moving to more seamless workflows, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO of Avid.   Our balance sheet is solid, ending the quarter with $50 million of cash and we remain committed to delivering sustained profitability.
Avid is currently reviewing its prior tax and accounting treatment of an intercompany loan made in 2007 between two of its international subsidiaries. Avid's preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2012 do not reflect the potential impact of this matter, and the final conclusions and results of its review
could impact Avid's final financial results for the first quarter of 2012 and the results of prior periods. Based on the current status of its review, which is in its initial stages and subject to change, Avid currently believes that the impact of this matter could increase tax expenses by approximately $4.5 million. Avid also currently believes it would recover approximately $3.8 million of this amount in a subsequent period, resulting in a net tax expense of approximately $700,000 on a cumulative basis.
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avid's first quarter 2012 financial results will be held today, April 26, 2012 at 4:30 p.m. ET. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing 719.457.2617 and referencing confirmation code 4569475. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avid's website.

(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter)
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
On May 10, 2012, Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2012 in which the Company included revised financial information for each quarter of 2011 and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company is now furnishing the attached Exhibit 99.1 containing reconciliations of financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to non-GAAP financial measures for each of the three month periods ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012, in each case which replace the reconciliations previously furnished for the corresponding periods.
The tables included in Exhibit 99.1 contain non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the SEC. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect the Company's ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management believes it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with management's use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures the Company's management uses may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, terms referring to non-GAAP financial measures used in the tables included in Exhibit 99.1, such as non-GAAP net income or net loss, do not have standardized meanings. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of the Company's performance in relation to other companies. The Company seeks to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables included in Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained in this Item 2.02 (including Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On July 2, 2012, Avid Technology, Inc. (the "Company") committed to a reduction in force and related actions intended to improve operational efficiencies.  The reduction in force impacts approximately 20% of the Company's employees, including employees being transferred to the entities specified in Item 7.01 below.  In connection with these actions and the divestitures referred to in Item 7.01 below, the Company intends to focus its resources on the media enterprise market and the post and professional market. The Company anticipates that it will complete the reduction in force and related actions during the third quarter of 2012.  The Company expects to incur total expenses relating to termination benefits and facility costs associated with the reduction in force and related actions of approximately $19 million to $23 million, which primarily represent cash expenditures. The Company expects to record the majority of these charges in the quarter ended June 30, 2012.  In aggregate, the annualized cost savings, excluding product material cost, estimated to be realized by the Company from these actions and the divestitures referred to in Item 7.01 below are approximately $80 million.  These savings will appear in both the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, the Company expects overall gross margins to improve in the second half of 2012 and further improve in 2013 due to favorable product mix and the Company's cost reduction efforts.
 
The Company is still evaluating the impact of the reduction in force and related actions and the divestitures described in Item 7.01 below on its financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.

BURLINGTON, MA July 2, 2012
Today
Avid (NASDAQ: AVID) initiated a series of strategic actions to focus the company on its Media Enterprise and Post & Professional customers and to drive improved operating performance.  As part of these actions, the company is divesting its consumer businesses.  With these changes, Avid will concentrate on core markets where its deep domain expertise, track-record of technical innovation, and strong brand offer the greatest opportunity for success.
 
"The changes we are announcing today make Avid a more focused and agile company," said Gary Greenfield, CEO of Avid. "By streamlining and simplifying operations, we expect to deliver improved financial performance and partner more closely with our enterprise and professional customers. Our objective remains to provide these customers with the innovative solutions that allow them to create the most listened to, most watched and most loved media in the world.  I'm excited about our future prospects."
 
Avid has agreed to sell its consumer audio and video product lines. The company's consumer audio products are being sold to inMusic, the parent company of Akai Professional, Alesis and Numark, among others. Headquartered in Cumberland, Rhode Island, inMusic's brands are best known for producing innovative products for music production, performance and DJing. The products involved in this transaction include M-Audio brand keyboards, controllers, interfaces, speakers and digital DJ equipment and other product lines. Avid will continue to develop and sell its industry-leading Pro Tools line of software and hardware, as well as associated I/O devices including Mbox and Fast Track.
 
Separately, the company's consumer video editing line is being sold to Corel Corporation, a consumer software company headquartered in Ottawa, Canada. The products involved in this transaction include Avid Studio, Pinnacle Studio, and the Avid Studio App for the Apple iPad
, as well as other legacy video capture products.
 
The divested product lines contributed approximately $91 million of Avid's 2011 revenue of $677 million.  As part of the transactions, certain employees of Avid will transfer to each acquiring company.  Avid estimates that the proceeds from these transactions will be approximately $17
 
million, subject to closing inventory adjustment, with a portion held in escrow.  Both transactions are expected to close today, July 2, 2012.
Avid also plans to reduce the number of its employees as it streamlines operations, with approximately 20% of its permanent employee base impacted by the divestitures and headcount reduction plans.   The company currently expects to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $19 to $23 million related to these actions and other associated measures.
 
The company's cash balance on March 31, 2012 was $49.7 million.  The proceeds from the sale of these product lines should offset most of the restructuring charges paid in 2012.
 
Conference Call
 
A conference call to discuss these actions has been scheduled for today, July 2, 2012 at 12:00 p.m. ET. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing (719)-325-2234 and referencing confirmation code 2084154.  The call and presentation slides will also be available on Avid's website. To listen and view the slides, go to http://ir.avid.com/events.cfm prior to the start of the conference call.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Avid Announces Results for Second Quarter 2012
Reports Year-on-Year Revenue Growth for Non-divested Business
BURLINGTON, MA- July 30, 2012-
Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported GAAP revenues of $157.4 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, compared to $161.8 million for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $39.0 million, or $1.01 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.29 per share, in the second quarter of 2011.
Excluding revenue from the consumer product lines divested on July 2nd, the revenue for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 was $143.7 million and the revenue on the same basis for the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 was $137.3 million.
The GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2012 and 2011 included amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures, acquisition and other costs, losses on assets held for sale and asset sales, legal settlement for 2011 only and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $34.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2012 was $4.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.09 per share, for the second quarter of 2011.
The GAAP operating loss for the second quarter of 2012 was $37.8 million and excluding the items identified above, except tax adjustments, the non-GAAP operating loss for the second quarter was $2.1 million.
Our results for the second quarter were encouraging with 5% year-on-year revenue growth for our ongoing business and a $10 million sequential increase in our cash balance, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO of Avid.   This performance reinforced the strategic direction we took earlier this month and we are excited about our prospects for the second half of the year.
Revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 were $309.6 million, compared to revenues of $327.5 million for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the first six months of 2012 was $52.0 million, or $1.34 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $15.9 million, or $0.42 per share, for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 included $40.5 million of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures, acquisition and other costs, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $11.5 million, or $0.30 per share, for the first half of 2012. The GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 included $13.2 million of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, legal settlement, acquisition-related costs, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 was $2.7 million or $0.07 per share.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables attached to this release.
The company's cash balance on June 30, 2012 was $59.4 million. The quarter-end cash balance excludes the proceeds from the sale of consumer product lines of $14.5 million, a portion of which is being held in escrow. It is expected that these proceeds will offset the majority of cash cost associated with the Company's 2012 restructuring plan.
The company continues to review certain estimates associated with the divestiture of consumer product lines and estimates related to the restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures.  A change in those estimates could result in adjustments to the company's financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which could be material. 
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss Avid's second quarter 2012 financial results will be held today, July 30, 2012 at 5:00 p.m. ET. The call will be open to the public and can be accessed by dialing 719.457.2617 and referencing confirmation code 4569475. The call and subsequent replay will also be available on Avid's website.

for complete details prior to the start of the conference call.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is in the tables attached to this press release.
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, terms referring to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net loss, do not have standardized meanings. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The financial results included in this release are preliminary and unaudited. The contents of this release are subject to the completion and filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This release may include forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that relate to future results or events are forward-looking statements and are based on Avid's current estimates and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, may, plan, feel, could, will, and would, or similar expressions. Actual results and events in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: adjustments that may be made to Avid's preliminary financial results included in this release as a result of the review of certain estimates associated with the sale of Avid's consumer audio and video product lines and restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures; Avid's ability to execute its strategic plan and meet customer needs; Avid's ability to realize operational and financial benefits from the sale of its consumer audio and video product lines and the reduction in workforce
announced earlier this month; Avid's ability to sell its professional products through retail sales channels following the divestiture of consumer products sold through those sales channels; its ability to produce innovative products in response to changing market demand, particularly in the media industry; competitive factors; fluctuations in its revenue, based on, among other things, Avid's performance in particular geographies or markets, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and seasonal factors; adverse changes in economic conditions; Avid's liquidity; and other risk factors and uncertainties disclosed previously and from time to time in Avid's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avid's estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

He is also eligible to participate in the Companys annual performance bonus plan, where his target annual bonus is equal to 35% of his base salary, with a portion of the target annual bonus tied to the attainment of company performance objectives (currently 80%) and the remaining amount tied to the attainment of individual performance objectives (currently 20%). Potential payouts range from 0% to greater than 35% of base salary based on the degree to which performance objectives have been met and other factors, including the discretion of the plan administrator. Any bonus paid for 2012 will be pro-rated by the number of days he was employed by the Company in 2012.
 
Equity Awards
. On October 15, 2012 (the Grant Date), the Company granted to Mr. Johnsen the following equity awards under the Companys Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan:
           an option to purchase 8,000 shares of the Companys common stock, which will have a seven year term and an exercise price per share equal to $8.88 (the closing price of the Companys common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the Grant Date), with 25% of such shares vesting on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and the remaining 75% of such shares vesting in equal 6.25% installments every three months thereafter ending on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date;
 an option to purchase 16,000 shares of the Companys common stock, which will have a seven year term and an exercise price per share equal to $8.88 (the closing price of the Companys common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the Grant Date), with vesting of such shares tied to the Companys achievement of annual return on equity (ROE) targets or operating margin targets set forth below:
      4,000 time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), with each unit representing the right to receive one share of the Companys common stock. 25% of such RSUs will vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and the remaining 75% of such RSUs will vest in equal 6.25% installments every three months thereafter ending on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date; and
           4,000 performance-based RSUs, with each unit representing the right to receive one share of the Companys common stock.  These RSUs will vest on a performance-based schedule tied to the achievement of annual ROE targets or operating margin targets set forth below:
Any performance-based RSUs that have not vested as of the date the Board makes the final determination of ROE and operating margin for 2022 will be forfeited.
ROE will be the percentage determined using the Companys published non-GAAP pre-tax income for the applicable year divided by the average common stockholder equity during the same year. ROE determinations for each year will be made by the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, based upon the Companys financial results for the applicable calendar year.
Operating margin is defined as the percentage determined using the Companys published non-GAAP operating profit divided by the Companys published revenue for the applicable year. Operating margin determinations for each year will be made by the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, based upon the Companys financial results for the applicable year.
For the avoidance of doubt, the percentage of performance-based options or RSUs that vests will be the higher of the ROE or operating margin vesting percentage achieved on a vesting date and is not cumulative.
In each case, vesting is conditioned on Mr. Johnsen being employed by the Company on the applicable vesting date.
Severance
. The Letter provides that if Mr. Johnsens employment is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Letter) other than due to his long-term disability, then the Company will pay to Mr. Johnsen (i) his base salary for a period of six months following his termination, (ii) an annual bonus, if earned, pro-rated by the number of months he was employed by the Company during the year of the date of his termination, and (iii) an amount equal to the Companys portion of his COBRA premiums for 6 months after the termination of his employment.
 
If Mr. Johnsens employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause within one year after a change-in-control of the Company, in addition to the severance described above, the Company will pay to Mr. Johnsen an additional six months base salary, and the exercisability, with respect to stock options, and the payment, with respect to RSUs, of 25% (or such smaller percentage as may then be unvested) of the original amount of any individual stock option or RSU grant made to Mr. Johnsen will accelerate in full as of his last date of employment.
Other Benefits
.
Mr. Johnsen will be eligible to participate in the benefit programs generally available to officers of the Company.
The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Letter is qualified in its entirety by the Letter, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012, and incorporated herein by reference.

Avid Provides Preliminary Third Quarter 2012 Results
BURLINGTON, MA October 22, 2012
Avid (
NASDAQ: AVID)
today reported certain preliminary financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012.
Avids third quarter results are preliminary, subject to change, and expressed in approximate figures. Avid currently plans to hold a conference call on October 29, 2012 to provide additional detail and updated results for the third quarter
and information as to current expectations for the fourth quarter.
The company currently expects revenues to be $125 to $127 million and the GAAP net loss to be $17 to $19 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012. This compares to revenue of $164.7 million and a GAAP net loss of $7.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011.
The third quarter revenue includes $4 million of revenue related to the July 2012 divestitures of its video and audio consumer-focused businesses. The revenue for the on-going business for the third quarter of 2012 was $121 to $123 million, down 14% to 15% compared to on-going revenue for the third quarter of 2011 of $143 million.
The company believes the decline was largely due to sales execution in the Americas region and some transitional issues related to the implementation of the strategic actions announced by the company in July 2012.
The estimated GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2012 includes amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures, acquisition and other costs, and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $14 million. Excluding these items, the estimated non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2012 is expected to be $3 to $5 million.
The GAAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2012 is expected to be $16 to $18 million and excluding the items identified above, except tax adjustments, totaling $14 million, the non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter is expected to be $2 to $4 million.
The company also reported that it ended the September 30, 2012 quarter with a cash balance of $71 million and no bank debt outstanding.
EXHIBIT 99.1
Avid will hold a conference call on October 29, 2012 at 4:15 p.m. (EDT) to review its financial results for the third quarter of 2012. The call will follow the dissemination of the companys press release on those results.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
Management considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing our business. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally, for example, in establishing annual operating budgets, in assessing operating performance and for measuring performance under incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures are also used in operating and financial decision-making because we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business and allow meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe it is useful for investors and others to also review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare in a consistent manner the companys current financial results with past financial performance. The primary limitations associated with our use of non-GAAP financial measures are that they may not include all items of income and expense that affect our operations and that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, terms referring to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release, such as non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, do not have standardized meanings. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.
EXHIBIT 99.1
Use of Forward-Looking Statements
The financial results included in this release are unaudited. The contents of this release are preliminary and subject to change. This release may include forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release that relate to future results or events are forward-looking statements and are based on Avids current estimates and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as anticipate, believe, should, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, may, plan, feel, could, will, and would, or similar expressions. Actual results and events in future periods and for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including: accounting and other adjustments that may be made to the preliminary financial results; Avids ability to execute its strategic plan and meet customer needs; Avid's ability to realize operational and financial benefits from the sale of its consumer audio and video product lines and the reduction in workforce announced in July 2012; Avid's ability to sell its professional products through retail sales channels following the divestiture of consumer products sold through those sales channels; its ability to produce innovative products in response to changing market demand, particularly in the media industry; competitive factors; fluctuations in its revenue, based on, among other things, Avids performance in particular geographies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and seasonal factors; adverse changes in economic conditions; Avids liquidity; and other risk factors and uncertainties disclosed previously and from time to time in Avids filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent Avids estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing the companys estimates as of any subsequent date. While Avid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Avid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the estimates change.

Avid (

The GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $17.4 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.20 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
Revenue for the ongoing business for the third quarter of 2012 was $123.0 million compared to $142.8 million of ongoing revenue for the same period in 2011.
The GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 included amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures, gain on asset sales, acquisition and other costs and related tax adjustments collectively totaling $14.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2012 was $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per share, for the third quarter of 2011.

The company's balance sheet remains strong with cash of $71 million, up $12 million sequentially.
 
During the third quarter we completed the majority of the changes we announced earlier this summer, said Gary Greenfield, chairman and CEO of Avid.   Despite the transitional issues we experienced in the
quarter, we remain focused on executing the business strategy we outlined in July as the path to returning the business to sustained profitability.
Revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 were $436.7 million, compared to revenues of $492.2 million for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the first nine months of 2012 was $69.6 million, or $1.80 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $23.5 million, or $0.61 per share, for the same period in 2011. The GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 included $55.1 million of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and costs and allowances related to divestitures, acquisition and other costs, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss was $14.6 million, or $0.38 per share, for the first nine months of 2012. The GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 included $21.6 million of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, legal settlement, acquisition-related costs, loss on asset sales and related tax adjustments. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 was $1.9 million or $0.05 per share.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results and a reconciliation of ongoing revenue are included in the tables attached to this release.

Agreement
 
In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, Executive and the Company, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
 
 
Article 1. Services
 
1.1. . Commencing on February 11, 2013 (the Effective Date) and throughout the Term (as defined below), Executive shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth below.
Service
 
1.2. . During the Term, Executive agrees to perform such executive duties consistent with his position as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board or Board of Directors) and to devote his full working time and attention to such duties. Following the Effective Date, Executive shall be permitted to continue his then-existing roles as an adviser, consultant, and/or board member for other companies. However, Executive shall not increase his formal responsibilities with respect to such companies, or take on new formal responsibilities with other companies, without prior Board approval.
Duties
 
1.3. . During the Term, Executive will not undertake any commitments, engage or have an interest in any outside business activities or enter into any consulting agreements which, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors (excluding Executive), conflict with the Companys interests or which might reasonably be expected to impair the performance of Executives duties as a full-time employee of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may pursue personal interests (including, without limitation, industry, civic and charitable activities) and attend to his personal investments, so long as such activities do not interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder.
No Conflicting Commitments
 
1.4. . Executive shall continue as a member of the Board of Directors as of the Effective Date and shall serve as a member of the Board without additional compensation. During the Term, at each annual meeting of the Companys stockholders at which Executives membership on the Board expires, the Company will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board. Executives service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Upon termination of Executives employment with the Company for any reason, unless the Board affirmatively requests that Executive remain on the Board, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from the Board voluntarily as of the last day of employment with the Company; and at the Boards request, Executive will execute any documents necessary to reflect such resignation.
Board Membership
 
 
 
Article 2. Term
 
2.1. . The term of this Agreement (the Term) shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date unless the Term is:
Term
 
2.1.1 extended pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.1; or
 
2.1.2 terminated when Executives employment terminates pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof;
 
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term shall continue to automatically be extended for periods of one (1) year so long as neither party provides written notice to the other of its intent to terminate by a date which is at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the then-current expiration date of this Agreement, and, provided further, that (i) in the event that a Change-in-Control of the Company (as defined in Section 4.2.2) should occur during the twelve (12) months prior to the end of the then-current Term and Executive is still an employee of the Company at that time, then the Term shall be deemed to expire no earlier than the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such Change-in-Control of the Company, (ii) in the event a Potential Change-in-Control Period (as defined in Section 4.2.6) exists within the twelve (12) months prior to the end of the then-current Term and Executive is still an employee of the Company as of that date, the Term shall be deemed to expire no earlier than the date that is twelve (12) months after the commencement of such Potential Change-in-Control Period and (iii) the expiration of the Term shall not adversely affect Executives rights under this Agreement which have accrued prior to such expiration (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all severance pay, benefits and other rights that accrue under Article 4 as a result of termination of Executives employment before the last day of the Term). For the avoidance of doubt, if a Potential Change-in-Control Period shall commence in the twelve (12) months prior to the end of the then-current Term and a Change-in-Control of the Company shall also occur during such twelve (12) month period, and if Executive is still an employee of the Company on the date of the Change-in-Control of the Company, the Term shall be deemed to expire no earlier than twelve (12) months after the date of such Change-in-Control. Unless the services of Executive have terminated prior to or upon the end of the Term in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, from and after the end of the Term, Executive shall be an employee-at-will.
 
Article 3. Payments

During the Term, the Company shall pay Executive an annual base salary (the Base Salary) of Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000), payable in regular installments in accordance with the Companys usual payment practices. The Base Salary shall be reviewed by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee at least annually and increased (but not decreased) accordingly at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
Base Compensation
 
 
 
3.2. . Commencing with the Companys fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 and thereafter during the remainder of the Term, Executive shall be eligible to participate in an annual performance bonus plan pursuant to which he shall be eligible to receive a target annual bonus (the Annual Incentive Bonus) equal to One Hundred percent (100%) of his then Base Salary for full attainment of his performance objectives (which may include company-wide objectives), with a maximum annual bonus equal to Two Hundred percent (200%) of his then Base Salary for extraordinary performance on all or nearly all of his performance objectives. The amount of Executives Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, shall be based on the degree to which Executives performance objectives for a fiscal year have been met. The Compensation Committee of the Board (after discussion with the Executive and receiving input from the Board) shall establish Executives performance objectives for fiscal year 2013 in writing as soon as practicable after the Effective Date. Thereafter, during the Term, Executives performance objectives for each fiscal year shall be established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (after discussion with Executive) during Executives annual performance review; provided, that in no event shall the percentages set forth in this Section 3.2 to be used in calculating Executives Annual Incentive Bonus be reduced. The Compensation Committee of the Board shall determine, for each fiscal year, the extent to which Executives performance objectives for such fiscal year have been attained and the corresponding amount of the Annual Incentive Bonus, if any, for such fiscal year. Any Annual Incentive Bonus earned by Executive with respect to a fiscal year shall be paid to him promptly after the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year but in no event later than 2.5 months after the end of such fiscal year.

Equity Grant
 
3.3.1. . Effective as of the Effective Date, pursuant to a stock option agreement, Executive will be awarded an option to purchase Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand (725,000) shares of Avid Technology, Inc. common stock (the Stock Option). The exercise price will be the closing price of the stock on the Effective Date (the Start Price).
Option Grant
 
a) One Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of the Stock Option will vest on a time-based schedule in equal 6.25% increments every three months, with the first vesting date on May 11, 2013 and the last vesting date on February 11, 2017, as long as Executive is employed by the Company on each such vesting date.
 
b) Six Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand (625,000) shares of the Stock Option (the "ROE Option Shares") will vest in accordance with the following table, based upon improvement in the Company's Return on Equity, or ROE (as defined below), in calendar year periods, commencing with calendar year 2013.  Improvements for each calendar year shall be measured against a baseline ROE for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2012 ("Baseline").
 
 
 
The Board (excluding Executive if he is a member of the Board) shall make the final determination of ROE and the ROE percentage point improvement for purposes hereof for each calendar year no later than the 1st day of March following the end of such calendar year.

The ROE Option Shares, if any, that are not vested at the end of the seventh calendar year shall be forfeited.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, the vested percentage at any time shall not be less than the vested percentage at any prior time. For example, if ROE for 2013 is 4% above the Baseline, 30% of the ROE Option will be vested; if ROE for 2014 is only 2% above the Baseline, the vested percentage shall remain 30%; and if ROE for 2015 is 6% above the Baseline, the vested percentage shall increase to 45% and shall not thereafter be reduced.

Effective as of the Effective Date, pursuant to a restricted stock unit agreement, Executive will be granted One Hundred Thousand (100,000) restricted stock units (the Restricted Stock Unit Grant), which will vest as to 25% of the units on February 11, 2014 and in equal 6.25% increments every three months thereafter, commencing on May 11, 2014, until fully vested on February 11, 2017, as long as Executive is employed by the Company on each such vesting date.

Covenant Regarding Registration
 
3.4. . During the Term, the Company shall provide Executive and his dependents with medical insurance and such other cash and noncash benefits, on the same terms and conditions, as amended from time to time, as are generally made available by the Company to its full-time executive officers. Executive shall be entitled to six (6) weeks of paid vacation per year.

c) the Company shall pay Executive incentive compensation for the fiscal year in which the termination of Executives employment with the Company occurs in the amount of the Termination Bonus Amount (as defined above) multiplied by the sum of One Hundred Percent (100%) plus the Pro Ration Percentage; such payment will be made at the same time as the severance payment required by paragraph b), above;
 
d) if Executive is eligible to receive and elects to continue receiving any group medical and dental insurance coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), the Company shall pay to Executive the following amount for each month that starts after the Date of Termination and on or before the earliest of (x) the first anniversary of the Date of Termination, (y) the date Executives coverage ends by reason of failure to pay the required premium or (z) the date on which Executive becomes eligible to receive group medical and dental insurance benefits from another employer that are substantially equivalent (including, without limitation, equivalent as to benefits, premium costs and co-pay amounts) to those provided by the Company as of the Date of Termination: 167 percent of the excess of (i) the total monthly premium for the coverage that Executive elects to receive over (ii) the monthly amount that the Company requires its Chief Executive Officer to pay for such coverage. Subject to Section 4.5 (Section 409A provisions), the payment for each month shall be made during such month. Executive agrees to notify the Company in writing promptly upon becoming eligible to receive the group medical and dental insurance described in clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence from another employer;
 
e) the Company shall provide Executive, at the Companys sole cost, with full executive outplacement assistance with an agency selected by Executive (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company), provided that no outplacement benefits shall be provided after the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs;
 
f) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Company stock plan, or under the terms of any grant, award agreement or form for exercising any right under any such plan (including, without limitation, the agreements evidencing the Stock Option and the Restricted Stock Unit Grant), any stock options, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights or other equity participation rights held by Executive as of the date Executives employment with the Company terminates shall become exercisable or vested, as the case may be, with respect to all time-based vesting awards as to an additional number of shares equal to the number that would have been exercisable or vested as of the end of the 12 month period immediately following the date Executives employment with the Company terminates (as if Executive had remained employed by the Company until the end of such 12-month period), and
 
 
g) Executive shall be entitled to exercise any such options or other awards or equity participation rights until 12 months after the date Executives employment with the Company terminates (but not after the latest expiration date prescribed by the applicable award agreement), but all performance-based vesting awards that have not vested as of the end of the fiscal year in which Executives employment with the Company terminates (determined based on actual performance) shall be forfeited as of such date. No other payments or benefits shall be due under this Agreement to Executive, but Executive shall be entitled to any benefits accrued or earned in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company.
 
4.3.4. . If, within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company, Executive shall terminate Executives employment pursuant to Section 4.1.6 or the Company shall terminate Executives employment pursuant to Section 4.1.4, then in any such event, subject to Section 4.6:
Without Cause or with Good Reason After a Change-in-Control of the Company
 
a) Unless otherwise required by law to be paid on a different date, the Company shall pay Executive the following amounts as severance pay (and without regard to the provisions of any benefit plan) in a lump sum in cash within five (5) days after the release of claims described in Section 4.6 becomes effective (and no later than the last day of the applicable 2 month period prescribed by Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)):
 
(i) the sum of (A) Executives accrued but unpaid Base Salary through the date Executives employment with the Company terminates, plus (B) the Annual Incentive Bonus for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which Executives employment with the Company terminates, if unpaid, (C) the product of (x) Executives Termination Bonus Amount, and (y) One Hundred Percent (100%) plus the Pro Ration Percentage, plus (D) any accrued but unused vacation pay; and
 
(ii) the amount equal to one and a half (1.5) times the sum of (i) Executives Base Salary in effect as of the date Executives employment with the Company terminates, plus (ii) Executives Termination Bonus Amount.
 
b) if Executive is eligible to receive and elects to continue receiving any group medical and dental insurance coverage under COBRA, the Company shall pay to Executive the amount described in Section 4.3.3(d), above, for each month that starts after the Date of Termination and on or before the earliest of (x) the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Date of Termination, (y) the date Executives coverage ends by reason of failure to pay the required premium or (z) the date on which Executive becomes eligible to receive group medical and dental insurance benefits from another employer that are substantially equivalent (including, without limitation, equivalent as to benefits, premiums and co-pay amounts) to those provided by the Company as of the Date of Termination (Executive agrees to notify the Company in writing promptly upon becoming eligible to receive such group medical and dental insurance from another employer);
 
 
c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Company stock plan, or under the terms of any grant, award agreement or form for exercising any right under such plan (including, without limitation, the agreements evidencing the Stock Option and the Restricted Stock Unit Grant), all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and other equity participation rights then held by Executive with respect to the common stock of the Company (or securities exchanged for such common stock in connection with the Change-in-Control of the Company) shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable, and Executive shall be entitled to exercise any such options or other awards or equity appreciation rights until 18 months after the date Executives employment with the Company terminates (but not after the latest expiration date prescribed by the applicable award agreement); and
 
d) the Company shall provide Executive, at the Companys sole cost, with full executive outplacement assistance with an agency selected by Executive (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company), provided that no outplacement benefits shall be provided after the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which Date of Termination occurs.
 
4.3.5. . If, during the existence of a Potential Change-in-Control Period, Executive shall terminate Executives employment pursuant to Section 4.1.6 or the Company shall terminate Executives employment pursuant to Section 4.1.4, then in any such event, subject to Section 4.6, Executive shall receive the payments, benefits and rights set forth in Section 4.3.4.
Without Cause or with Good Reason During a Potential Change-in-Control Period
 
 
4.4. .
Excess Parachute Payments
 
4.4.1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that (a) any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive (including any payment or benefit received or to be received in connection with a Change-in-Control or the termination of Executive's employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") is reasonably likely to be treated as a parachute payment (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) and (b) Executives forfeiture of payments due would result in the aggregate after-tax amount that Executive receives being greater than the aggregate after-tax amount he would receive if there were no such forfeiture, then payments otherwise required by this Agreement that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be reduced (if necessary, to zero) to the extent necessary to ensure that Executive does not receive a parachute payment under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, Executive may elect to have noncash amounts reduced (or eliminated) prior to any reduction of any cash amounts.
 
 
4.4.2 For purposes of this limitation, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a "payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change-in-Control, the Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (iii) payments shall be reduced only to the extent necessary so that the Total Payments (other than those referred to in clauses (i) or (ii)) in their entirety constitute reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code or are otherwise not treated as parachute payments under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, and (iv) the value of any noncash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
 
4.5. .
Section 409A
 
4.5.1. Each payment to Executive under this Article 4 shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Payments hereunder shall first be made from the portion that does not consist of nonqualified deferred compensation until it is exhausted and then shall be made from the portion, if any, that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. If Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the commencement of the delivery of any payments that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation will be delayed to the earlier of (a) date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after Executives Date of Termination or (b) a date determined by the Company that is within thirty (30) days after Executives death (the Earliest Payment Date). Any payments that are delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid on the Earliest Payment Date. The determination of whether, and the extent to which, any of the payments to be made to Executive hereunder are nonqualified deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable exclusions under Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4) and (9). Any payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service set forth in Treasury Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year of Executive following the taxable year of Executive in which Executives employment with the Company terminates. Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until Executive has incurred a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Executive shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to Executive) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.
 
4.5.2. The parties acknowledge and agree that the interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and its application to the terms of this Agreement is uncertain and may be subject to change as additional guidance and interpretations become available. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits and payments required by this Agreement are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be administered, construed, and interpreted consistent with such intent. If, however, any such benefit or payment is nevertheless deemed to not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive agree to renegotiate in good faith any such benefit or payment (including, without limitation, as to the timing of any severance payments payable hereof) so that either (i) Section 409A of the Code will not apply or (ii) compliance with Section 409A of the Code will be achieved; provided, however, that any resulting renegotiated terms shall provide to Executive the after-tax economic equivalent of what otherwise has been provided to Executive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided further, that any deferral of payments or other benefits shall be only for such time period as may be required to comply with Section 409A; and provided, further, that payments or other benefits that occur as a result of the application of this Section 4.5.2 shall themselves be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
4.6. . In order to be eligible to receive any of the payments or benefits under Sections 4.3.3, 4.3.4 or 4.3.5, Executive (or his personal representative, if applicable) shall be required to execute and deliver to the Company (without subsequent revocation) and allow to become effective and unrevoked, within sixty (60) days after the Date of Termination or such shorter period as the Company then provides, a binding severance and mutual release agreement in a form provided by and reasonably satisfactory to the Company which shall contain a release of claims by Executive substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Release
 
Article 5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
5.1. . Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and accordingly agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company and the following period: (a) one year after the date Executives employment with the Company terminates, in the case of a termination other than within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company, or (b) 18 months after the date Executives employment with the Company terminates, in the case of a termination within 12 months after a Change-in-Control of the Company:
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
5.1.1. Executive will not perform services for or own an interest in (except for investments of not more than five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares or other equity interests of a company or entity in which Executive does not actively participate in management) any firm, person or other entity that competes in any geographic area with the Company in the business of the development, manufacture, promotion, distribution or sale of professional or consumer film, video or audio production tools, including, but not limited to, editing, special effects, 3D, animation, live sound, broadcast or newsroom products or systems, content-creation tools, media storage or other business or services in which the Company is engaged or plans (as evidenced by consideration by the Companys executive staff or by the Board) to engage at the time Executives employment with the Company terminates.
 
5.1.2. Executive will not directly or indirectly assist others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is prohibited to engage by Section 5.1.1.
 
 
5.1.3.

This Section 5.1.3 (i) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual whose employment with the Company has been terminated or whose engagement to the Company as an independent contractor has been terminated and (ii) shall not apply to the solicitation, hiring or engagement of any individual arising from such individuals affirmative response to a general recruitment effort carried out through a public solicitation or a general solicitation.
 
5.1.4. Executive will not directly or indirectly either alone or in association with others solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by Executive to solicit, any current or future customer or supplier of the Company to cease doing business in whole or in part with the Company or otherwise adversely modify his, her or its business relationship with the Company.
 
5.2. . It is expressly understood and agreed that (a) although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Article 5 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Article 5 is unenforceable, such restriction shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed to be enforceable to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable and (b) if any restriction contained in this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
Reasonableness of Restrictions
 
5.3. . Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Companys remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 5 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive expressly agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.

On March 21, 2013, Avid Technology, Inc. announced that, due to the previously disclosed delay in the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the Form 10-K), the Company has, as expected, received on March 19, 2013 a notification letter from staff of the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff). The notification states that the Company is no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The NASDAQ letter was issued in accordance with standard NASDAQ procedure, which provides that failure to timely file the Company's Form 10-K could serve as a basis for the delisting of the Company's stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Company intends to submit to the Staff a plan as to how it plans to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. The NASDAQ notice specifies that this plan has to be submitted by May 20, 2013. If the Staff accepts the Company's plan, the Company expects to have up to 180 calendar days from the initial due date for the Form 10-K, or until September 16, 2013, to regain compliance. If the Staff does not accept Avid's plan, Avid will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel.

On March 19, 2013, the Company filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC stating that it was unable to file the Form 10-K with the SEC on or before March 18, 2013, the prescribed due date, because it is continuing to evaluate the accounting treatment related to bug fixes, upgrades and enhancements in certain of the Company's customer arrangements (collectively, Software Updates). The primary focus of the Company's evaluation to date has been to determine whether certain Software Updates previously thought to be only bug fixes met the definition of post-contract customer support under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company is working diligently to complete the review and continues to focus its efforts on completing the Form 10-K filing as soon as possible.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
In March 2013, Avid Technology, Inc. (the Company) announced that due to the delay in the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (Form 10-K), it had received a notification letter from the staff of the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department (the NASDAQ Staff) stating that the Company does not comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).
On May 17, 2013, the Company received an additional notification from the NASDAQ Staff of the Companys continued noncompliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to the Companys delay in filing its Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013 (Form 10-Q). The notification was issued in accordance with NASDAQ procedure, which provides that failure to comply with the above-referenced rule could serve as a basis for the delisting of the Companys stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
The Company has, in accordance with the NASDAQ Staffs requirements as set forth in the notification, on May 20, 2013, submitted a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQs continued listing requirements. If the NASDAQ Staff accepts the Companys plan, the Company expects to have up to 180 calendar days from the initial due date for the Form 10-K, or until September 16, 2013, to regain compliance. If the NASDAQ Staff does not accept the Companys plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel. The NASDAQ notifications have no immediate effect on the listing of the Companys common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
The Company issued a press release on May 21, 2013 disclosing the Companys receipt of the additional NASDAQ notification letter. A copy of such press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
As previously reported in the Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing of Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and Notification of Late Filing of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 (collectively the Notices of Late Filing) and the Current Report on Form 8-K (the March Form 8-K) filed by the Company with the Commission on March 21, 2013 (collectively with the Notices of Late Filing, the Prior Reports), during the course of the Companys normal review of its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, it was determined that the Company needed to evaluate its current and historical accounting treatment related to bug fixes, upgrades, enhancements and compatibility extensions (collectively Software Updates).
The first step in the Companys evaluation was to undertake an initial review of whether Software Updates previously made available by the Company to certain of its customers at no-charge included upgrades, enhancements or compatibility extensions and if so, whether such upgrades, enhancements or compatibility extensions met the definition of post-contract customer support (PCS) under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). During the course of this initial review, the Company concluded that certain of these no-charge Software Updates should have been accounted for as implied PCS when recognizing revenue for the original sale of the related product.
On May 20, 2013, after evaluating managements initial assessment of the potential magnitude of the incorrect application of GAAP with respect to certain Software Updates, the Audit Committee of the
        
        
Companys Board of Directors concluded, after discussions with the Companys management that the Companys unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended (i) September 30, 2012 and 2011, (ii) June 30, 2012 and 2011, and (iii) March 31, 2012 and 2011, as well as its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 should no longer be relied upon because of these errors in the application of GAAP. The Company's Audit Committee discussed this matter with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. In addition, any previously issued press release or other publicly issued statement by the Company containing financial information for such periods should not be relied upon.
The Company expects that the timing of revenue recognition for the impacted customer arrangements will change from the historical presentation in the Companys financial statements pursuant to which revenue was recognized up front, generally to being recognized ratably over the estimated implied PCS service period. In addition, the timing of recognition of certain costs related to these customer arrangements may also be impacted, along with the timing of related income taxes. The Company cannot at this time estimate the full impact of the adjustments of revenue and costs, and the related impact on income taxes, on any previously issued financial statements for any individual reporting period, although it may be significant. However, while the restatement adjustments will impact previously reported revenue and operating results for prior periods, the restatement adjustments are not expected to affect the amount of total revenue ultimately to be earned, or the amount or timing of cash received or to be received, from the sales transactions or the Companys liquidity or cash flow for any prior period.
In addition, the Company will revise its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for the correction of the errors previously identified and disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012.
The Company is also reassessing its accounting for certain restructuring expenses related to lease obligations and other exit activities in the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012. While the Company continues to analyze the accounting treatment of these restructuring expenses, the Company has concluded that it has improperly accounted for such restructuring expenses and currently estimates that the restructuring expenses may have been cumulatively overstated by approximately $3.5 million on a pre-tax basis at September 30, 2012.
The Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2012 or March 31, 2013 because of the material weaknesses in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting relating to the matters disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012 and the matters described in this Form 8-K.
The Companys evaluation of current and historical accounting treatment related to Software Updates is ongoing and the Company may identify additional issues, which could require further adjustments to the Companys prior financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years or periods.
When the Companys evaluation is completed, the Company intends to correct the above-described errors through the filing of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company is not currently able to predict when it will file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.
        
        
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 21, 2013, the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AVID ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF SECOND ANTICIPATED NASDAQ LETTER AND INITIAL DETERMINATIONS OF ITS ACCOUNTING EVALUATION
Burlington, MA, May 21, 2013
- In March 2013, Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVID) announced that due to the delay in the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (Form 10-K), it had received a notification letter from the staff of the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department (the NASDAQ Staff) stating that the Company does not comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Avid, announced today that on May 17, 2013, it received from the NASDAQ Staff an anticipated notification of Avid's continued noncompliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to Avid's delay in filing its Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013 (Form 10-Q). These notifications were issued in accordance with NASDAQ procedures and have no immediate effect on the listing of Avid's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market.
On May 20, 2013, Avid has, in accordance with the NASDAQ Staff's requirements as set forth in the notification, submitted a plan explaining how it expects to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. If the NASDAQ Staff accepts the Company's plan, the Company expects to have up to 180 calendar days from the initial due date for the Form 10-K, or until September 16, 2013, to regain compliance. If the NASDAQ Staff does not accept Avid's plan, Avid will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel.
The Company has, as previously reported, been unable to file the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q because it is continuing to evaluate the accounting treatment related to bug fixes, upgrades, enhancements and compatibility extensions (collectively, Software Updates). The first step in the Company's evaluation was to undertake an initial review of whether Software Updates previously made available by the Company to certain of its customers at no-charge included upgrades, enhancements or compatibility extensions and if so, whether such upgrades, enhancements or compatibility extensions met the definition of post-contract customer support (PCS) under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). During the course of this initial review, the Company concluded that certain of these no-charge Software Updates should have been accounted for as implied PCS when recognizing revenue for the original sale of the related product. The Company management has evaluated the potential impact of its findings on the Company's prior period financial statements and concluded that the Company's unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended (i) September 30, 2012 and 2011, (ii) June 30, 2012 and 2011, and (iii) March 31, 2012 and 2011, as well as its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 should no longer be relied upon because of these errors in the application of GAAP. In addition, any previously issued press release or other publicly issued statement by the Company containing financial information for such periods should not be relied upon.
The Company expects that the timing of revenue recognition for the impacted customer arrangements will change from the historical presentation in the Company's financial statements pursuant to which revenue was recognized up front, generally to being recognized ratably over the estimated implied PCS service period. In addition, the timing of recognition of certain costs related to these customer arrangements may also be impacted, along with the timing of related income taxes. The Company cannot at this time estimate the full impact of the adjustments of revenue and costs, and the related impact on income taxes, on any previously issued financial statements for any individual reporting period, although it may be significant. However, while the restatement adjustments will impact previously reported revenue and operating results for prior periods, the restatement adjustments are not expected to affect the amount of total revenue ultimately to be earned, or the amount or timing of cash received or to be received, from the sales transactions or the Company's liquidity or cash flow for any prior period.
In addition, the Company will revise its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for the correction of the errors previously identified and disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012.
The Company is also reassessing its accounting for certain restructuring expenses related to lease obligations and other exit activities in the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012. While the Company continues to
analyze the accounting treatment of these restructuring expenses, the Company has concluded that it has improperly accounted for such restructuring expenses and currently estimates that the restructuring expenses may have been cumulatively overstated by approximately $3.5 million on a pre-tax basis at September 30, 2012.
The Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2012 or March 31, 2013 because of the material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting relating to the matters disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012 and the matters described in this press release.
T
he Company's evaluation of current and historical accounting treatment related to Software Updates is ongoing and the Company may identify additional issues, which could require further adjustments to the Company's prior financial statements for one or more prior fiscal years or periods.
The Company is working diligently to complete the review and continues to focus its efforts on completing and filing the delayed periodic reports, including restatements, as soon as possible. During this evaluation, the Company plans to continue to invest in its product innovation and execute on its growth strategy. The Company believes it is well positioned to support its customers' ongoing success.
