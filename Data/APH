Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. April 16, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $.54 compared to $.40 per share for the 2002 period. Sales for the first quarter 2003 increased 9% to $277,774,000 compared to $255,976,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.8 million in the first quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results. Sales were up 9% compared to last year's first quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 89% of our sales, was up a strong 15% over last year, and the growth was broad based across substantially all of our major end markets and all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our presence with the leading OEM's in our target markets. The coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks portion of our business, which represents 11% of our sales, was down from last year as both domestic and international cable operators have curtailed their capital spending for network upgrades and expansion. In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Our operating income margin was 16.3% and cash flow from operations was $35.8 million. As previously announced, we are pursuing a refinancing of our senior credit facilities which, when completed, will include a redemption of our senior subordinated notes. Such refinancing will extend the maturity dates of principal in comparison to our current loan agreements. In addition, in late March we completed the acquisition of Insilco Holding Company's custom assembly business."
        "Notwithstanding the excellent first quarter results, the overall economic climate is uncertain and it continues to be difficult forecasting future results. I believe we are well established with leading positions in excellent and diversified markets, and we continue to increase our presence with major OEM's in these markets. However, the timing and strength of a general economic recovery is the uncertainty. Assuming a reasonable and stable economic climate and given the excellent first quarter results, I have increased confidence in achieving our earlier outlook of a 4-7% increase in revenues and a 20-25% increase in EPS (excluding debt refinancing costs) in 2003."
        The Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results at 1:00 PM (EST) April 16, 2003. The toll free dial-in number to participate in this call is 800-988-0490; International dial-in number 630-395-0020; Passcode: Jepsen. There will be a replay available until 5:00 PM (EST) on

Box 5030 Wallingford, CT 06492-7530 Telephone (203) 265-8900 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Edward G. Jepsen Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 203/265-8650 www.amphenol.com ANNOUNCED COMPLETION OF REFINANCING AND CALL FOR REDEMPTION OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES Wallingford, Connecticut. May 6, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that it has completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities and has called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). The new $750 million credit facility consists of: (1) a $125 million five year revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn, (2) a $125 million Tranche A loan which will amortize over the five year period through May 2008, and (3) a $500 million Tranche B loan with $5 million per year amortization through 2009 and final maturity in 2010. The net proceeds from the refinancing are being used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company's previous senior credit agreement totaling approximately $440 million, redeem all outstanding Notes totaling $144 million and for working capital purposes. The Company indicated that it will incur one-time expenses relating to the refinancing of approximately $10.5 million ($.16 per share), representing the call premium on the Notes, write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and other related costs. Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "We are very pleased to complete this refinancing. Under the Company's previous credit agreement, we had
approximately $440 million of required loan amortization over the next three years. Under the new credit agreement, required loan amortization for that period has been reduced to approximately $60 million. While it is still our intention to further reduce debt levels, the new credit agreement gives us significantly increased flexibility to pursue additional opportunities to grow and expand our business. Furthermore, upon completion of the Notes redemption, we will have achieved this enhanced financial flexibility without increasing our projected interest costs."

D. CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6, (i) Company shall have the option to convert at any time all or any part of its outstanding Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Revolving Loans equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount from Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to one basis to Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to an alternative basis and (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR Loan, Company shall have the option to continue as a LIBOR Loan all or any portion of such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any LIBOR Loan, Company shall have failed to give a Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect to such LIBOR Loan in accordance with this subsection 2.2D, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation electing to continue such LIBOR Loan as a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period of one month. Company shall deliver a duly executed Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan).

Upon receipt of written or telephonic notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D, Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit such notice by telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender. 43
Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of Company or for otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.2D, and upon conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice, Company shall have effected a conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6F, a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to, or continuation of, a LIBOR Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith. E. POST-MATURITY INTEREST. Any principal payments on the Loans not paid when due and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans or any fees or other amounts owed hereunder not paid when due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans of the applicable Type (any such fees and other amounts being deemed for such purposes to bear interest on the same basis as Revolving Loans). Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender. F. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Loans shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Prime Rate, on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be and (ii) in the case of LIBOR Loans and Base Rate Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Federal Funds Effective Rate, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such LIBOR Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; PROVIDED that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan. 2.3 FEES.

C. OTHER FEES. Company agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, Syndication Agent and Lenders, as applicable, such other fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between Company and Administrative Agent or Syndication Agent, as the case may be. 2.4 REPAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS AND REDUCTIONS IN REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS; GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS; APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTIES.

Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied as specified by Company in the applicable notice of prepayment; PROVIDED that in the event Company fails to specify the Loans of Company to which any such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied FIRST to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans to the full extent thereof, SECOND to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof, and THIRD to repay outstanding Term Loans to the full extent thereof.

(d) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS TO BASE RATE LOANS AND LIBOR LOANS; OPTION TO DEFER CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LIBOR LOANS. Considering Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to LIBOR Loans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by Company pursuant to subsection 2.6D; provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that (1) the application of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4B(iv) would result in the prepayment of all or any portion of a LIBOR Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (2) the remaining term of such Interest Period is less than three 50
months, and (3) no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Company shall have the option, by giving written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of its election to do so on or before the first Business Day prior to the date on which such prepayment would otherwise be required to be made, to defer the making of such prepayment until the last day of such Interest Period or such earlier date as Company may specify in such notice.

(ii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS TO PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Except as provided in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal. (iii) APPORTIONMENT OF PAYMENTS. Aggregate principal and interest payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such payments relate, in each case proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares. Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its Lending Office or at such other address as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share of all such payments received by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees of such Lender when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any LIBOR Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter. (iv) PAYMENTS ON BUSINESS DAYS. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be. 51

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to LIBOR Loans as to the matters covered: A. DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. As soon as practicable after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time), on each Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to LIBOR Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender. B. INABILITY TO DETERMINE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. In the event that Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any LIBOR Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR, Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Company and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (which notice Administrative Agent shall give at such time as such circumstances no longer exist) and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company. C. ILLEGALITY OR IMPRACTICABILITY OF LIBOR LOANS. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall be made only after consultation with Company and Administrative Agent, it being understood that any such determination so made shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its LIBOR Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law 53
even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER" and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its outstanding LIBOR Loans (the "AFFECTED LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (d) any Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall have the option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, LIBOR Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent clearly demonstrable error. 2.8 NOTICE OF CERTAIN COSTS; OBLIGATION OF LENDERS AND ISSUING LENDERS TO MITIGATE. A. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6 requires any Lender or Issuing Lender to give notice to Company of an event or a condition that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6, as the case may be, in the event such 59
notice is given by such Lender or Issuing Lender more than 180 days after such Lender or Issuing Lender has knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, such Lender or Issuing Lender shall not be entitled to receive any such payments under subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6, as the case may be, in respect of the period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given to Company. B. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, if an event occurs or a condition arises that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6, it will, if so requested by Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to (i) make, issue, fund or maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the affected Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable in good faith, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 would be materially reduced and if the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) through such other lending or letter of credit office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise materially adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) or cause such Lender or Issuing Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; PROVIDED that nothing in this subsection 2.8 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of Company or the rights of any Lender provided in subsection 2.6C, 2.7 or 3.6. 2.9 DEFAULTING LENDERS. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender (a "DEFAULTING LENDER") defaults (a "FUNDING DEFAULT") in its obligation to fund any Revolving Loan (a "DEFAULTED REVOLVING LOAN") in accordance with subsection 2.1 as a result of the appointment of a receiver or conservator with respect to such Lender at the direction or request of any regulatory agency or authority, then (i) during any Default Period (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Loan Documents, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, until such time as the Default Excess (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, (a) any voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding and the Revolving Loan Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (b) any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such mandatory prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender, it being understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain any portion of any 60
mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions of this clause (b), (iii) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the commitment fee payable to Lenders pursuant to subsection 2.3A in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to subsection 2.3A with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and (iv) the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender. For purposes of this Agreement, (I) "DEFAULT PERIOD" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the period commencing on the date of the applicable Funding Default and ending on the earliest of the following dates: (A) the date on which all Revolving Loan Commitments are cancelled or terminated and/or the Obligations are declared or become immediately due and payable, (B) the date on which (1) the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero (whether by the funding by such Defaulting Lender of any Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender or by the non-pro rata application of any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Loans in accordance with the terms of this subsection 2.9 or by a combination thereof) and (2) such Defaulting Lender shall have delivered to Company and Administrative Agent a written reaffirmation of its intention to honor its obligations under this Agreement with respect to its Revolving Loan Commitment, and (C) the date on which Company, Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders waive all Funding Defaults of such Defaulting Lender in writing, and (II) "DEFAULT EXCESS" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the excess, if any, of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of all Lenders (calculated as if all Defaulting Lenders (other than such Defaulting Lender) had funded all of their respective Defaulted Revolving Loans) over the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender. No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.9, performance by Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of any Funding Default or the operation of this subsection 2.9. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this subsection 2.9 are in addition to other rights and remedies which Company may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default and which Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default. 2.10 REMOVAL OR REPLACEMENT OF A LENDER.

B. Company may, by giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so: (i) elect to (a) terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, of such Terminated Lender upon receipt by such Terminated Lender of such notice and (b) prepay at par on the date of such termination any outstanding Loans made by such Terminated Lender, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts payable to such Terminated Lender hereunder pursuant to subsection 2.6, subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 or otherwise; PROVIDED that, in the event such Terminated Lender has any Loans outstanding at the time of such termination, the written consent of Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required in order for Company to make the election set forth in this clause (i); or (ii) elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a "REPLACEMENT LENDER") in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.1B; PROVIDED that (a) on the date of such assignment, Company shall pay any amounts payable to such 62

C. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, pursuant to clause (i) of subsection 2.10B, (i) SCHEDULE 2.1 shall be deemed modified to reflect any corresponding changes in the Revolving Loan Commitments and (ii) such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement; PROVIDED that any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification under this Agreement (including under subsections 2.6D, 2.7, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3) shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

In addition, on the first Business Day of each calendar month each Issuing Lender shall deliver to Administrative Agent and each Revolving Lender a report setting forth the maximum aggregate amount which is at or any time thereafter may become available for drawing under all Standby Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender then outstanding (any amount which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars being determined by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate for such currency as at such date), and identifying each Standby Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender and the maximum amount that may become available thereunder and, in the case of each Standby Letter of Credit that is not denominated in Dollars, the applicable Exchange Rate for such Letter of Credit as at such date. (v) REPORTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND REVOLVING LENDERS REGARDING COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Issuing Lender (other than Administrative Agent) with respect to any Commercial Letter of Credit shall deliver to Administrative Agent, by telefacsimile transmission on the first Business Day of each week, a report setting forth the daily aggregate amount available for drawing during the immediately preceding week under all outstanding Commercial Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.

C. REVOLVING LENDERS' PURCHASE OF PARTICIPATIONS IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1, the Letters of Credit set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1C (the "EXISTING LETTERS OF 66
CREDIT") shall, effective as of such Closing Date, become Letters of Credit under this Agreement to the same extent as if initially issued hereunder and each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed to have irrevocably purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letters of Credit and drawings thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder. 3.2 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. Company agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to Letters of Credit issued hereunder: (i) with respect to each Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account, equal to the greater of (x) 0.125% per annum MULTIPLIED BY the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and (y) $500 and (b) a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the account of Revolving Lenders, equal to the Applicable Tranche A LIBOR Margin MINUS 0.125% per annum MULTIPLIED BY the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, each such fronting fee or letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears on and to (but excluding) each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, in each case computed on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual number of days elapsed; and (ii) with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder (without duplication of the fees payable under clause (i) above), customary documentary and processing charges payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with such Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be. For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clause (i) of this subsection 3.2, (1) the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of determination and (2) any amount described in such clause which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars shall be valued based on the applicable Exchange Rate for such currency as of the applicable date of determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause (i)(b) of this subsection 3.2, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such amount. 3.3 DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. A. RESPONSIBILITY OF ISSUING LENDER WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to ascertain whether they appear on 67
their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. B. REIMBURSEMENT BY COMPANY OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify Company and Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on or before the Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the "REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing; PROVIDED that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of such honored drawing and (ii) subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection 4.2B, Revolving Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing; and PROVIDED, FURTHER that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Company shall reimburse such Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be deemed to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Revolving Lender resulting from the failure of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this subsection 3.3B. C. PAYMENT BY REVOLVING LENDERS OF UNREIMBURSED AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. (i) PAYMENT BY REVOLVING LENDERS. In the event that Company shall fail for any reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided in subsection 3.3B in an amount (calculated, in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars, by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify each other Revolving Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such other Revolving Lender's respective participation therein based on such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata 68
Share. Each Revolving Lender shall make available to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing Lender specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the first business day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of such Issuing Lender is located) after the date notified by such Issuing Lender. In the event that any Revolving Lender fails to make available to such Issuing Lender on such business day the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection 3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Revolving Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender. (ii) DISTRIBUTION TO REVOLVING LENDERS OF REIMBURSEMENTS RECEIVED FROM COMPANY. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by such Issuing Lender from Company in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may request. D. INTEREST ON AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. (i) PAYMENT OF INTEREST BY COMPANY. Company agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, with respect to drawings honored under any Letters of Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Lender in respect of each such honored drawing from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Company (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B) at a rate equal to (a) for the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the Reimbursement Date, the rate then in effect under this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (b) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i) shall be computed in the manner specified in subsection 2.2F for the computation of interest on Base Rate Loans and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. 69
(ii) DISTRIBUTION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS BY ISSUING LENDER. Promptly upon receipt by any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest pursuant to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a drawing honored under a Letter of Credit issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender, out of the interest received by such Issuing Lender in respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which such Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B), the amount that such other Revolving Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for such period pursuant to subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of Credit, and (b) in the event such Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of such honored drawing, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest received by such Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such honored drawing so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders for the period from the date on which such Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders to but excluding the date on which such portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed by Company. Any such distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may request. 3.4 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

A. INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to amounts payable as provided in subsection 3.6, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless each Issuing Lender from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "GOVERNMENTAL ACTS"). B. NATURE OF ISSUING LENDERS' DUTIES. As between Company and any Issuing Lender, Company assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which 71
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B, any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection 3.5, Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Issuing Lender for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. 3.6 INCREASED COSTS AND TAXES RELATING TO LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Issuing Lender or Lender shall reasonably determine (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the introduction or adoption (after the Closing Date) of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or that any change (after the Closing Date) therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or that any determination (after the Closing Date) by a court or governmental authority, or that compliance by any Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made (after the Closing Date) by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), in any such case: (i) subjects such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) to any additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing Lender or Lender) with respect to the issuing or maintaining of any Letters of Credit or the purchasing or maintaining of any participations therein or any other obligations under this Section 3, whether directly or by such being imposed on or suffered by any particular Issuing Lender; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement in respect of any Letters of 72
Credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participations therein purchased by any Lender; or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) regarding this Section 3 or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) with respect thereto; then, in any case, Company shall pay to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender, promptly after receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder.

The agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, an Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of Credit, an Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include such Agent in its individual capacity. An Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from Company for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 9.3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPRAISAL OF CREDITWORTHINESS. Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Company and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders. 9.4 RIGHT TO INDEMNITY. Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent to the extent that such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Company, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 105
suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Person in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified Person. If any indemnity furnished to an Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Person, be insufficient or become impaired, such Person may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. 9.5 SUCCESSOR AGENTS AND SWING LINE LENDER. A. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Company. Upon any such notice of resignation, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon five Business Days' notice to Company, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent acceptable to Company (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. B. SUCCESSOR COLLATERAL AGENT. Any resignation of Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also constitute the resignation of DB or its successor as Collateral Agent, and any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Collateral Agent for all purposes under the Loan Documents. After any resignation of Collateral Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted by it while it was Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents. C. SUCCESSOR SWING LINE LENDER. Any resignation of Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also constitute the resignation of DB or its successor as Swing Line Lender, and any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swing Line Lender for all purposes hereunder. In such event (i) Company shall prepay any outstanding Swing Line Loans made by the retiring Administrative Agent in its capacity as Swing Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender shall surrender any Swing Line Note held by it to Company for cancellation, and (iii) if so requested by the successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E, Company shall issue a new Swing Line Note to the successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender substantially in the form of 106
EXHIBIT VII annexed hereto, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment then in effect and with other appropriate insertions. 9.6 COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AND GUARANTIES. Each Lender hereby further authorizes Collateral Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document as secured party and to be the agent for and representative of Lenders under the Guaranties and to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each Collateral Document, each Guaranty and the Intercreditor Agreement; PROVIDED that Collateral Agent shall not (i) enter into or consent to any material amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision contained in any Collateral Document, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Guaranties or (ii) release any Collateral (except as otherwise expressly permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Collateral Document), in each case without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6); PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that, without further written consent or authorization from Lenders, Collateral Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (a) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented or (b) release any Subsidiary from its Guaranty if all of the capital stock of such Subsidiary is sold to any Person (other than an Affiliate of Company) pursuant to a sale or other disposition permitted hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented. Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Company, Collateral Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (X) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any Collateral Document or to enforce the Guaranties, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the Guaranties may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by Collateral Agent at such sale. SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS IN LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT. A. GENERAL. Subject to subsection 10.1B, each Lender shall have the right at any time (i) to sell, assign or transfer to any Eligible Assignee, or (ii) to sell participations to any Person in, all or any part of its Commitments or any Loan or Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit or participations therein or any other interest herein or in any other Obligations owed to it; PROVIDED that no such sale, assignment, transfer or 107
participation shall, without the consent of Company, require Company to file a registration statement with the SEC or apply to qualify such sale, assignment, transfer or participation under the securities laws of any state; PROVIDED, FURTHER that no such sale, assignment or transfer described in clause (i) above shall be effective unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting such sale, assignment or transfer shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii); PROVIDED, FURTHER that no such sale, assignment, transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment, transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the Revolving Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or participation; and PROVIDED, FURTHER that, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Swing Line Loan Commitment and the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold, assigned or transferred as described in clause (i) above to any Person other than a successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to the extent contemplated by subsection 9.5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 10.1, no Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any granting of participations in, all or any part of its Commitments or the Loans, the Letters of Credit or participations therein, or the other Obligations owed to such Lender. B. ASSIGNMENTS. (i) AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF ASSIGNMENTS. Each Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or participation therein, or other Obligation may (a) be assigned in any amount to an Eligible Assignee that is another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund (treating any Related Funds as a single Eligible Assignee) of a Lender, with the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent or (b) be assigned in an aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall constitute the aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and participations therein, and other Obligations of the assigning Lender) to any other Eligible Assignee with the consent of (x) Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (y) so long as no Event of Default under subsection 8.6 or 8.7 shall have occurred and be continuing, Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) EXCEPT in connection with an assignment pursuant to clause (b) within 45 days after the Closing Date made as part of the primary syndication of the Loans and Commitments; PROVIDED that if any such Related Fund subsequently assigns all or any part of its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participation therein pursuant to clause (b), such assignment must be in an amount of at least $1,000,000 (either individually or when taken together with the amount assigned by all Related Funds), unless the aggregate amount of Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participation therein held by all such Related Funds is less than $1,000,000, in which case such aggregate amount may be assigned, with the consent of (x) Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (y) so long as no Event of Default under subsection 8.6 or 8.7 shall have occurred and be continuing, Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent of any such assignment in accordance with either clause (a) or (b) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved 108
of its obligations with respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participations therein, or other Obligations or the portion thereof so assigned. The parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of (i) $3,500 for assignments to Eligible Assignees other than another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender and (ii) $2,000 for assignments to another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender and, in each case, such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsections 2.7B(iii)(a). Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.8B) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; PROVIDED that, anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). The Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning Lender and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Notes hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the assigning Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E, be issued to the assignee and to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT IV, EXHIBIT V or EXHIBIT VI annexed hereto, as the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding Tranche A Term Loans and/or Tranche B Term Loans, and/or Revolving Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and the assigning Lender. (ii) ACCEPTANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; RECORDATION IN REGISTER.

extent such consent is required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Company. Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii). C. PARTICIPATIONS. The holder of any participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except action directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final maturity date of any Loan allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction of the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to such participation or a reduction of the fee payable in respect of any Letter of Credit allocated to such participation or a reduction of any commitment fee in respect of any Commitment allocated to such participation, and all amounts payable by Company hereunder (including amounts payable to such Lender pursuant to subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and 3.6) shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Company and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for purposes of subsections 10.4 and 10.5, (a) any participation will give rise to a direct obligation of Company to the participant and (b) the participant shall be considered to be a "Lender". D. ASSIGNMENTS TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND FUND TRUSTEES. In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this subsection 10.1, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank and any Lender which is an investment fund may pledge or assign all or any portion of its Notes, Loans or other Obligations owed to such Lender to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; PROVIDED that (i) no Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder. E. INFORMATION.

disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that the representations and warranties of such Lender contained in paragraph 1.2 of such Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. 10.2 EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, Company agrees to pay promptly (i) all the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of preparation of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto; (ii) all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Company (including any opinions requested by Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder) and of Company's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions on its part to be performed or complied with under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including with respect to confirming compliance with environmental, insurance and solvency requirements; (iii) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent (including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other documents or matters requested by Company; (iv) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Collateral Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any Collateral Document, including filing fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, search fees and reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to Collateral Agent; (v) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any environmental consultants retained by Administrative Agent or its counsel) of obtaining and reviewing any environmental audits or reports provided for on or before the Closing Date; (vi) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of the custody or preservation of any of the Collateral; (vii) all other actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the Commitments and the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (viii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of settlement, incurred by Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Lender in enforcing any Obligations of or in collecting any payments due from any Loan Party hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by reason of such Event of Default (including in connection with the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranties) or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. 10.3 INDEMNITY. In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection 10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, Company agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless each Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and each Lender (including Issuing Lender), and the officers, 111
directors, employees, trustees, advisors, partners, agents and affiliates of each Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and each Lender (collectively called the "INDEMNITEES"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); PROVIDED that Company shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. As used herein, "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES" means, collectively, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations and Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any thereof, or any enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranties), (ii) the statements contained in the commitment letter delivered by any Lender to Company with respect thereto, or (iii) any Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials relating to or arising from, directly or indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, Company shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them. 10.4 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by Company at any time or from time to time, without notice to Company or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of Company against and on account of any obligations and liabilities of Company then due and payable to that Lender under this Agreement, the Letters 112
of Credit and participations therein and the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not that Lender shall have made any demand for payment thereof. 10.5 RATABLE SHARING. Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; PROVIDED that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder. 10.6 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. A. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, or consent to any departure by Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; PROVIDED that no such amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent shall, without the consent of each Lender (with Obligations directly affected in the case of the following clause (i)): (i) extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or Note, or extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, or reduce the rate of interest on any Loan (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable to any Loan pursuant to subsection 2.2E) or any commitment fees or letter of credit fees payable hereunder, or extend the time for payment of any such interest or fees, or reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, (ii) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of this subsection 10.6, (iii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Requisite Lenders" 113

B. Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on Company in any case shall entitle Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by Company, on Company. 114

No failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 10.10 MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither Administrative Agent, nor Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Company or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.

and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. 10.11 SEVERABILITY.

Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. July 16, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs increased 30% to $.60 compared to $.46 per share for the 2002 period. Such per share amount for 2003 excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of the Company's debt completed in the second quarter. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2003 was $.45. Sales for the second quarter 2003 increased 13% to $304,893,000 compared to $270,865,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.9 million in the second quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        For the six months ended June 30, 2003, diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs was $1.14 compared to $.86 per share for the 2002 period. Such per share amount for the six month 2003 period excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt referred to above. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $.98. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $582,667,000 compared to $526,841,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $34.7 million for the six month 2003 period when compared to the 2002 period.
        As previously announced, in the second quarter 2003 the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities and redeemed all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). In conjunction therewith, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt totaling $10,367,000 (before tax benefit of $3,525,000) or $.16 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the call premium on the Notes, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and other related costs.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results. Sales were up 13% compared to last year's second quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 17% over last year, and the growth was broad based across substantially all of our major military/aerospace, industrial/automotive and communications end markets and all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets. The coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks portion of our business, which represents 12% of our sales, was up sequentially from the first quarter this year but down from the second quarter last year as both domestic and international cable operators have curtailed their capital
spending for network upgrades and expansion. In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding one-time refinancing expenses, represent the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. Our operating income margin continued strong at 16.2% for the quarter, and cash flow from operations was $26.8 million. The debt refinancing completed in the quarter gives us significantly increased flexibility to pursue additional opportunities to grow and expand our business. In addition, the acquisition of the Insilco cable assembly business completed in the first quarter and the acquisition of the PCD industrial/avionics business completed in the second quarter made a positive contribution to operations."
        "Notwithstanding the excellent second quarter and first half results, the overall economic climate remains challenging and the timing and strength of a general economic recovery remains uncertain; and accordingly it continues to be difficult forecasting future results. However, we are encouraged with our leading positions in excellent and diversified markets and by our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets. In addition, the excellent first half results and the fine execution on our operating plans gives us the confidence that we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2003 revenue growth from 4-7% to 9-12% and our expectation for full year 2003 EPS increase from 20-25% to 25-30% (excluding the one-time debt refinancing costs)."
        The Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter results at 1:00 PM (EST) July 16, 2003. The toll free dial-in number to participate in this call is 888-381-5774; International dial-in number 210-839-8502; Passcode: Jepsen.

Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $1.62.

Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our third quarter results.  Sales were up 17% compared to last year's third quarter.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 18% over last year, and the growth was broad based across all of our end markets comprising mobile communications, computer/data communications, industrial, automotive and military/aerospace markets and the sales increase included all major geographic regions.  The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was up 12% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter, was up 33% over last year and represents the seventh consecutive quarterly increase.  The diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $.64 includes a charge of approximately $750,000, or $.01 per share, for the cost of the secondary offering completed in the third quarter this year.   Our operating income margin was a strong 16.6%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Cash flow from operations was also excellent at $34.9 million for the quarter.  During the year, we have substantially reinvested the strong cash flow in the business and also reduced our outstanding debt by $73.0 million."
"On the basis of the strong third quarter results, we are again revising upward our expectation for full year 2003 revenue growth from 9-12% to 13-15% and our full year 2003 EPS increase (excluding the one-time second quarter debt refinancing costs) from 25-30% to 31-33%, or an EPS expectation for the fourth quarter 2003 of $.64-$.68.

In the fourth quarter, we also acquired a relatively small U.S. manufacturer of antennas for wireless network infrastructure. The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering to this global market. The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was also up a strong 29% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year; however, operating margins in this market continue to be adversely impacted by increasing material costs."
        "In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share for the quarter was up 42% over last year and represents the eighth consecutive quarterly increase. Earnings per share for the year of $2.52 per share, excluding the one-time
refinancing expenses, matches our all-time record year of 2000. Our consolidated operating income margin for the quarter was strong at 16.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was also excellent at $54.1 million for the quarter and $159.4 million for the year. During the year, we have reinvested the strong cash flow in the business and also reduced our outstanding debt by $101.3 million."
        "I am also very pleased to announce that the following members of our operating management team have been appointed Corporate officers: Gary Anderson, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Aerospace and Industrial Operations; Jamie Fraser, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Interconnect Systems; Mark Twaalfhoven, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Commercial Connectors; Luc Walter, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, European Military and Aerospace Operations; Udo Naujoks, Vice President and Group General Manager, Amphenol Tuchel Electronics; and Adam Norwitt, Vice President and Group General Manager, RF and Microwave Products."
        "We had an excellent year in 2003 and look to the future with great enthusiasm based on our excellent product portfolio and technological capabilities, our strong position in excellent and diversified markets, our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets and an outstanding management team. Our enthusiasm and confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to effect a 2 for 1 stock split in the first quarter 2004, which should further improve the liquidity and trading in our stock. We are also encouraged by the increasing signs of a general economic recovery. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, I believe that in 2004 we can achieve an increase in revenues in the range of 8%-11% and an increase in EPS in the range of 16%-21% (excluding the 2003 one-time refinancing expenses)."

Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. January 21, 2004. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 42% to $.74 compared to $.52 per share for the 2002 period. Sales for the fourth quarter 2003 increased 28% to $342,039,000 compared to $267,046,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.6 million in the fourth quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        For the year ended December 31, 2003, diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs was $2.52 compared to $1.85 per share for 2002. Such per share amount for the year 2003 excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of the Company's debt in the second quarter 2003. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2.36. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $1,239,504,000 compared to $1,062,002,000 for 2002. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63.9 million for the year 2003 when compared to 2002.
        The Company also announced that it will effect a 2 for 1 stock split for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on or about March 29, 2004.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results. Sales were up 28% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 28% over last year with excellent profitability. The growth was broad based across all of our end markets comprising mobile communications, computer/data communications, industrial, automotive and military/aerospace markets and the sales increase included all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets. In the fourth quarter, we also acquired a relatively small U.S. manufacturer of antennas for wireless network infrastructure. The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering to this global market. The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was also up a strong 29% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year; however, operating margins in this market continue to be adversely impacted by increasing material costs."
        "In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share for the quarter was up 42% over last year and represents the eighth consecutive quarterly increase. Earnings per share for the year of $2.52 per share, excluding the one-time

Cash flow from operations was also excellent at $54.1 million for the quarter and $159.4 million for the year. During the year, we have reinvested the strong cash flow in the business and also reduced our outstanding debt by $101.3 million."
        "I am also very pleased to announce that the following members of our operating management team have been appointed Corporate officers: Gary Anderson, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Aerospace and Industrial Operations; Jamie Fraser, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Interconnect Systems; Mark Twaalfhoven, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Commercial Connectors; Luc Walter, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, European Military and Aerospace Operations; Udo Naujoks, Vice President and Group General Manager, Amphenol Tuchel Electronics; and Adam Norwitt, Vice President and Group General Manager, RF and Microwave Products."

(b)
To comply fully and in a timely manner with the applicable provisions of Rule 424, Rule 430A and Rule 462 under the Act.
(c)
To advise the Representatives promptly and, if requested by the Representatives, to confirm such advice in writing, (i) when the Registration Statement has become effective and when any post-effective amendment to it becomes effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the suspension or qualification of the Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for such purposes, and (iv) of the happening of any event during the period referred to in paragraph (f) below which makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus untrue or which requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or of the necessity to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) to comply with the Act or any other law. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company will make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time.
(d)

(f)
Promptly after the Registration Statement becomes effective, and from time to time thereafter for such period as a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or a dealer, to furnish to each Underwriter as many copies of the Prospectus (and of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus) as such Underwriter may reasonably request.
(g)
If, during the period specified in paragraph (f), any event shall occur as a result of which it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, forthwith to (i)(A) prepare and file, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) above, with the Commission an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or (B) file under the Exchange Act a document to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, so that in either case, the statements in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with the Act and the Exchange Act, and (ii) furnish to each of the Representatives, such number of copies of such documents as such Underwriter may reasonably request.

Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters, their officers and directors and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and all persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section, and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters, their officers and directors and such control persons of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by each of the Representatives. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of any Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Attorneys. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than
twenty business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have (a) failed to comply with such reimbursement request or (b) contested, in good faith, such fees and expenses of counsel. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(e)
To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action, that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of its Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint. The Selling Stockholders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares sold by each Selling Stockholder hereunder and not joint.
(f)
Each Selling Stockholder that is not a KKR Selling Stockholder hereby designates CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its authorized agent, upon which process may be served in any action which may be instituted in any state or federal court in the State of New York by any Underwriter, any director or officer of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter asserting a claim for indemnification or contribution under or pursuant to this Section 8, and each such Selling Stockholder will accept the jurisdiction of such court in such action, and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any defense based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or venue. A copy of any such process shall be sent or given to such Selling Stockholder, at the address for notices specified in Section 12 hereof.

Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 21, 2004.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 48% to a record $.40 compared to $.27 per share for the comparable 2003 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.)  Sales for the first quarter 2004 increased 28% to $355,261,000 compared to $277,774,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.2 million in the first quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results.  Sales were up 28% compared to last year's first quarter and the operating income margin increased from 16.3% to 17.3%.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 89% of our sales, was up a strong 28% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across most of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in infrastructure and mobile handset components for wireless communication markets.  The excellent top
 
line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally strengthening economy.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 11% of our sales, was up a strong 27% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year; however, the operating income margin in this market was impacted by increasing material costs."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 48% over last year and represents the ninth consecutive quarterly increase.  Earnings per share of $.40 for the quarter is the highest ever, a significant accomplishment considering our long history of excellent profitability.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 17.3%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also significant at $31.8 million for the quarter."
 
"With the first quarter results, 2004 is off to a great start.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well, and we have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Furthermore, while uncertainties remain, there are signs of a general
economic recovery, albeit some geographic regions are more robust than others.  Accordingly, assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2004 results to a sales increase in the range of 12% to 15% and earnings per share increase in the range of 25% to 30%; this compares to our prior estimates of sales and earnings per share increases of 8% to 11% and 16% to 21%, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 21, 2004.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 50% to a record $.45 compared to $.30 per share for the comparable 2003 period (excluding the effect in 2003 of a one-time charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt).  In the second quarter 2003, the Company refinanced its long term debt and incurred a one-time charge for write off of deferred debt issuance costs, early repayment premium and other related costs; diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2003 including such one-time charge was $.22.  All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.  Sales for the second quarter 2004 increased 27% to a record $387,119,000 compared to $304,893,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $8.5 million in the second quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, diluted earnings per share was $.85 compared to $.57 per share for the 2003 period (excluding the one-time charge in the 2003 period referred to above).  Diluted earnings per share for the six month 2003 period including
 
the one-time refinancing charge referred to above was $.49.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $742,380,000 compared to $582,667,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $24.7 million for the six month 2004 period when compared to the 2003 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results.  Sales were up 27% compared to last year's second quarter and the operating income margin increased from 16.2% to 17.8%.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 27% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in infrastructure and mobile handset components for wireless communication markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally stronger economy.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was also up a strong 28% over the prior year; however, the operating income margin in this market continued to be impacted by higher material costs which were only partially offset by a price increase implemented in the latter part of the quarter."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 50% over last year and represents the tenth consecutive quarterly increase.  Sales of $387.1 million and earnings per share of $.45 for the quarter were the highest ever, a significant accomplishment considering our long history of excellent growth and profitability.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 17.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is after interest expense and taxes, again exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also very strong at $53.9 million for the quarter and $85.7 million for the six months 2004."
 
"It was a very good quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well, and we have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Accordingly, assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are again revising upward our expectation for full year 2004 results to a sales increase in the range of 19% to 22% and earnings per share increase in the range of 35% to 40%; this compares to our prior estimate of sales and earnings per share increases of 12% to 15% and 25% to 30%, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter who failed to deliver a Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, (so long as the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto was provided by the Company to the Underwriter in the requisite quantity and on a timely basis to permit proper delivery on or prior to the Closing Date) to the person asserting any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such material misstatement or omission or alleged material misstatement or omission was cured in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person.
        (c)   The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each Selling Stockholder and each person, if any, who controls such Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
        (d)   In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c) (the "
indemnified party
"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
indemnifying party
") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(c), or pursuant to both Sections 8(b) and 8(c), the Underwriter shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(d), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Underwriter). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriter, its officers and directors and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and all persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section, and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Underwriter, its officers and directors and such control persons of the Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of any Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling Stockholders. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than twenty business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have (a) failed to comply with such reimbursement request or (b) contested, in good faith, such fees and expenses of counsel. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
        (e)   To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
        The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed
to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action, that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of its Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Stockholders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares sold by each Selling Stockholder hereunder and not joint.
        (f)    [reserved].

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as counsel to Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Selling Stockholders (as defined below) in connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of 6,656,814 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Shares"), of the Company from certain selling stockholders of the Company (the "Selling Stockholders") named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement among you, the Company and the Selling Stockholders dated September 9, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement").
        We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-111687) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's prospectus, dated February 12, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated September 9, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2004, September 9, 2004 and September 10, 2004 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Underwriting Agreement; relating to the Shares to be sold to the Underwriter, as named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriter"), by such Selling Stockholders. We also have examined a specimen certificate representing the Class A Common Stock of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Selling Stockholders and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
        In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, in connection with our opinion set forth in paragraph 4 below, we have assumed that (i) The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") is a "securities intermediary" as defined in Section 8-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the "New York UCC"), and the State of New York is the "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" of DTC for purposes of Section 8-110 of the New York UCC, (ii) the Shares are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, and DTC or another person on behalf of DTC maintains possession of certificates representing the Shares, (iii) DTC indicates by book entries on its books that security entitlements with respect to the Shares have been credited to the
Underwriter's securities accounts and (iv) the Underwriter is purchasing the Shares without notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of the New York UCC).
        Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
        1.     The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the law of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.
        2.     All of the Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
        3.     Each Selling Stockholder that is a Delaware limited partnership has full partnership power, right and authority to sell such Shares.
        4.     Upon the payment and transfer contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter will acquire a security entitlement with respect to the Shares and no action based on an adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriter.
        5.     The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's Class A Common Stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such Class A Common Stock in all material respects.
        6.     The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and by or on behalf of each Selling Stockholder that is a Delaware limited partnership.
        7.     The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach or result in a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and which the Company has represented lists all material agreements and instruments to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law by any court or governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties.
        8.     No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law is required for the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter.
        9.     The sale of the Shares by KKR 1996 Fund L.P., NXS Associates L.P. and KKR Partners II L.P., each of which is a Delaware limited partnership (the "KKR Limited Partnerships"), and the compliance by the KKR Limited Partnerships with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument identified on the annexed schedule furnished to us by the KKR Limited Partnerships and which each KKR Limited Partnership has represented lists all material agreements
and instruments to which such KKR Limited Partnership is a party or by which such KKR Limited Partnership is bound or to which any of the property or assets of such KKR Limited Partnership is subject, nor will such action violate the Partnership Agreement of any KKR Limited Partnership or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over any KKR Limited Partnership or any of its properties.
        10.   No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act is required for the sale of the Shares by the Selling Stockholders and the compliance by the Selling Stockholders with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Act and the Exchange Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter.
        11.   The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the Prospectus was filed on September 10, 2004 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
        12.   There are no preemptive rights under federal or New York law or under the Delaware General Corporation Law to subscribe for or purchase shares of Company capital stock. There are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, nor any restriction upon the voting or transfer of, any shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the Company's charter or by-laws or any agreement or other instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and which the Company represented lists all material agreements and instruments to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party.

        We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-111687) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated February 12, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 9, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act; or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 (the "Company's 2003 Annual Report"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 (the "2004 Quarterly Reports"), Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2004, September 9, 2004 and September 10, 2004 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and we take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in numbered paragraph 5 of our opinion letter to you dated the date hereof.
        In connection with, and under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Shares, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP, your representatives and your counsel and with the general counsel of the Company in the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents) and also reviewed certain records and documents furnished to us by the Company, as well as the documents delivered to you at the closing. We did not participate in the preparation of the Exchange Act Documents; however, we reviewed the Company's 2003 Annual Report and the 2004 Quarterly Reports prior to their filing with the Commission. Based upon our review of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our reviews made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents), our participation in the conferences referred to above, our review of the records and documents as described above, as well as our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder:

(ii)
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement (including the Company's 2003 Annual Report) as of the date of the filing of the Company's 2003 Annual Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents), as of September 9, 2004 or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I am General Counsel of Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and have advised the Company in connection with the sale by the Selling Stockholders of 6,656,814 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated September 9, 2004 between the Company, the Selling Stockholders and you (the "Underwriting Agreement").
        This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 9(g) of the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
        I have reviewed signed copies of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-111687) relating to the shares (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Company's prospectus dated February 12, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 9, 2004 (together, the "Prospectus"), in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. I have reviewed such documents and satisfied myself as to such other matters as I have deemed necessary in order to enable me to express this opinion. In my review, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, I have reviewed and relied upon, to the extent I have deemed such reliance proper, corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
        I am a member of the Bar of the State of Connecticut and do not express any opinion herein concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Connecticut, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States.
        Subject to the foregoing and to the further exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
        1.     The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement and to own, lease and operate its properties.
        2.     The Company is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        3.     All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the Shares, have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
        4.     Each Subsidiary has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement and to own, lease and operate its properties and, to my knowledge, is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        5.     All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and, except with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule I hereto, are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien, encumbrance or adverse interest of any nature, except as described in the Prospectus.
        6.     The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company, compliance by the Company with all the provisions thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document, agreement, indenture or other instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties are bound or (iii) to my knowledge, any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), where such conflict, default or violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        7.     To my knowledge, except as otherwise disclosed in the Prospectus, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective properties is the subject which is required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, and to my knowledge, no such proceeding is threatened.
        8.     To my knowledge, no contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein is not so described or filed as required.
        In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, I have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of and counsel to the Company, representatives of the independent certified public accountants of the Company and representatives of the Underwriter and counsel to the Underwriter at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although I have not undertaken to investigate or verify independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to my attention that give me reason to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of September 9, 2004 or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, I express no
opinion as to financial statements and related notes, the financial statement schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein.
        This opinion letter is rendered solely for your use in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person or for any other purpose without my prior written consent.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 20, 2004.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 47% to a record $.47 compared to $.32 per share for the comparable 2003 period.  Per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.  Sales for the third quarter 2004 increased 22% to $384,103,000 compared to $314,798,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $10.4 million in the third quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, diluted earnings per share was $1.31 compared to $.89 per share for the 2003 period (excluding the effect in 2003 of a one-time charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt).  In the second quarter 2003, the Company refinanced its long term debt and incurred a one-time charge for write off of deferred debt issuance costs, early repayment premium and other related costs; diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 including such one-time charge was $.81.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were
$1,126,483,000 compared to $897,465,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $35.1 million for the nine month 2004 period when compared to the 2003 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our third quarter results.  Sales were up 22% compared to last year's third quarter, a significant accomplishment in what is generally a seasonally softer quarter.  The operating income margin increased from 16.6% to 18.3%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 24% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless communication and military and aerospace markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally stronger economy compared to the prior year.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  In late September we acquired a French manufacturer of engineered cable assemblies for the automotive industry; a business with annual sales of approximately $40 million.  The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering to this global market.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was also up a strong 13% over the prior year.  In addition, the operating income margin in this segment strengthened as price increases
 implemented in the latter part of the second quarter partially offset the impact of higher material costs."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 47% over last year and represents the eleventh consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 18.3%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, again exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also very strong at $47.3 million for the quarter and $133.1 million for the nine months 2004."
 
"I am also very pleased that during the quarter Moody's upgraded the Company's credit rating to Ba1 and that Standard & Poor's has included the Company in its S&P 400 Mid Cap Index.  We appreciate this recognition of the Company's excellent liquidity and strong operational performance over an extended period.  Furthermore, in October, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the size of the Company's stock repurchase program, originally approved in March 2004, from two million shares to five million shares, and extended the termination date of the program until September 30, 2006.  Approximately four million shares remain available for purchase under this program."
 
"It was a very good quarter in all respects, and I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.
However, recent cautionary statements by economists and customers in certain of our markets suggest a higher level of uncertainty and an easing of the strong economic recovery of the first half of this year.  Nevertheless, assuming no significant change in the current economic climate and stable currency exchange rates, we now expect full year earnings per share to increase 43% to 45% compared to the prior guidance of 35% to 40%, and we believe fourth quarter sales and earnings per share will be in the range of $390 to $395 million and $.48 to $.50 per share, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

The toll free dial-in number to participate in this call is 888-395-9624; International dial-in number 517-623-4547; Passcode: Reardon.

Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 19, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 38% to a record $.51 compared to $.37 per share for the comparable 2003 period.  Per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2004 increased 18% to $403,963,000 compared to $342,039,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $11.5 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, diluted earnings per share was $1.82 compared to $1.26 per share for the 2003 period (excluding the effect in 2003 of a one-time charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt).  In the second quarter 2003, the Company refinanced its long term debt and incurred a one-time charge for write off of deferred debt issuance costs, early repayment premium and other related costs; diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 including such one-time charge was
$1.18.
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1,530,446,000 compared to $1,239,504,000 for 2003.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $46.6 million for the year 2004 when compared to 2003.
 
The Company also announced that for the first time in its history it will commence payment of a quarterly dividend on its Common Stock of $.03 per share.  The Company expects the dividend payment to be made on or about April 6, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2005.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results.  Sales were up 18% compared to last year's fourth quarter to a record $403,963,000.  The operating income margin increased from 16.8% to 18.8%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 20% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across the majority of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless communication, military and aerospace and industrial markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally stronger economy compared to the prior year.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was up 6% over
a comparatively strong quarter in the prior year; however, the operating income margins in this segment were adversely impacted by increasing material costs."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 38% over last year, representing the twelfth consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 18.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also very strong at $69.0 million for the quarter and $202.1 million for the year 2004."
 
"We had a record year in 2004 and look to the future with great enthusiasm based on our strong position in excellent and diversified markets, our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets, our excellent product portfolio and technological capabilities, and an outstanding management team.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe that we can achieve an increase in revenues in 2005 in the range of 9%-12% and an increase in EPS in the range of 18%-23%.  Our confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to commence payment of a $.03 per share quarterly dividend on the Company's Common Stock.  We are confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 20, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 30% to a record $.52 compared to $.40 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Sales for the first quarter 2005 increased 15% to $409,395,000 compared to $355,261,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $7.7 million in the first quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results.  Sales were up 15% compared to last year's first quarter to a record $409,395,000.  The operating income margin increased from 17.3% to 18.9%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 16% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the industrial, wireless communication and military and aerospace markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers and our
increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was up 8% over the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter were up 30% over last year, representing the thirteenth consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also strong at $39 million for the quarter."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, the Company has completed three acquisitions since the beginning of this year, with aggregate annual sales of approximately $70 million.  The acquisitions complement and broaden the Company's presence in a number of market segments and include a Korean manufacturer of handset related products, a United States manufacturer of fiber optic systems for high performance military and industrial markets and a United States manufacturer of high speed, high density interconnect products for computer and communications related markets.  These acquisitions contributed approximately $8 million in sales in the first quarter of 2005.  We are excited about the growth opportunities presented by these excellent additions."
"With the first quarter results, 2005 is off to a great start.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2005 results to a sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% and earnings per share increase in the range of 20% to 25%; this compares to our prior estimates of sales and earnings per share increases of 9% to 12% and 18% to 23%, respectively.  We expect second quarter results in the range of $430 million to $440 million and $.55 to $.57 for sales and EPS respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.  Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending
request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 20, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 29% to a record $.58 compared to $.45 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Sales for the second quarter 2005 increased 15% to $443,642,000 compared to $387,119,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $7.5 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, diluted earnings per share was $1.09 compared to $.85 per share for the 2004 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $853,037,000 compared to $742,380,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $15.2 million for the six month 2005 period when compared to the 2004 period.
 
In addition, on July 15, 2005 the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities.  The new senior credit agreement consists of a $750 million unsecured five year
 
revolving credit facility, of which approximately $440 million was drawn at closing.  The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company's previous senior secured credit facilities and for working capital purposes. In conjunction therewith, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.5 million (before tax benefit of $.8 million) or $.02 per share after tax.  Such one-time expenses will be reported in the third quarter and include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results.  Sales were up 15% compared to last year's second quarter to a record $443,642,000.  The operating income margin increased from 17.8% to 19.4%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 16% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless infrastructure, industrial and military and aerospace markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, our increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and acquisitions.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was up 7% over the prior year."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter were up 29% over last year, representing the fourteenth consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also strong at $49 million for the quarter."
 
"In addition, in May, the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of radio frequency interconnect products for military and aerospace related markets.  The Company has annual sales of approximately $20 million.  Including this most recent acquisition, the Company has completed four acquisitions since the beginning of the year.  We are excited about the growth opportunities presented by these excellent additions."
 
"We are also pleased to have completed the debt refinancing.  The new five year facility is unsecured and has improved pricing in recognition of the Company's strong operating performance, substantial deleveraging and the achievement of an investment grade credit rating from a major rating agency.  In addition, the new facility will provide significantly increased flexibility to pursue additional opportunities to expand and grow our business."
 
"It was a good quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2005 results to a sales increase
in the range of 13% to 15% and earnings per share increase in the range of 23% to 26%; this compares to our prior estimates of sales and earnings per share increases of 11% to 14% and 20% to 25%, respectively.  We expect third quarter results in the range of $435 million to $445 million and $.56 to $.58 for sales and EPS respectively.  This guidance excludes the impact in the third quarter of 2005 of one-time expenses associated with the refinancing of $.02 per share.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

In such event, Sellers agree that they shall not assert as a defense (in whole or in part) to any request for indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns) that the Offsite Release Environmental Claim was caused or exacerbated in whole or part by, or that Hazardous Materials migrated into or onto the Purchased Real Property from properties currently or formerly owned or occupied by, the Buyer Indemnified Parties.  The foregoing sentence shall not limit or diminish any other defense Sellers may otherwise be entitled to raise in response to any request for indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Sellers expressly reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or otherwise discharged any Buyer from, any claims against any Buyer arising from or relating to any Offsite Release Environmental Claim, so long as such claim is not asserted as a defense, counterclaim, cross-claim, or setoff to any request for indemnification hereunder by either the Buyer Indemnified Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns), and (ii) Buyers expressly reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or otherwise discharged, any defenses, counterclaims or cross claims they may have to such claims.

(1)
                                 
 
with respect to any Loss that Sellers seek to recover in that Proceeding, Buyers waive any right to claim that Sellers failed to mitigate such Loss or that costs incurred by Sellers in response to any indemnification requested hereunder by any Buyer Indemnified Parties are or were unreasonable provided that Sellers discharge their indemnification responsibilities hereunder, including pursuant to Section 10.03(b), in accordance with the terms of this subsection (G); and
(2)
                                 
 
Sellers may be represented in such Proceeding by counsel representing Sellers as the Indemnifying Party responding to any such Third Party Claim for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties request indemnification hereunder, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to compliance with clause (1) above, Buyers hereby waive any claims of conflict of interest against Sellers and their counsel with respect thereto.

If an indemnification payment is received by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, and such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, later receives insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries, or actually realizes any tax benefits specifically in respect of the related Loss, such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall promptly pay to Seller Parent or Buyer Parent, as applicable, a sum equal to the lesser of (y) the actual amount of insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries, or the tax benefits actually realized specifically in respect of the related Loss and (z) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by Sellers or Buyers, as applicable, to such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such Loss.

Section 10.03
                         
Procedures; No Waiver; Exclusivity
 
The party seeking indemnification under Article X (the "") agrees to give prompt written notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article X, such notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, suit, action or proceeding, the basis for indemnification hereunder and the approximate dollar amount of Loss for which indemnification is sought (if then reasonably qualifiable); provided, however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder.  If such event involves any claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third person (a ""), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party to assume the control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Third Party Claim, including, at its own expense, employment of counsel; , that if the Indemnifying Party shall have exercised its right to assume such control, the Indemnified Party (i) may, in its sole discretion, employ counsel to represent it (in addition to counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, and at the Indemnified Party's sole expense) in any such matter, and in such event counsel selected by the Indemnified Party shall be required to cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party's counsel in such defense, compromise or settlement, and (ii) will, at its own expense, make reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party those employees of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party whose assistance, testimony or presence is reasonably necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and in defending any such Third Party Claim; , , that any such access shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the business of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.  The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim,

If the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification hereunder or any proposed consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of any such Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party would reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its business in a manner that may not be adequately compensated by the money damages, or that the Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times and upon prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party to take over and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any such Third Party Claim.  If the Indemnified Party shall so assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim, all attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, to the extent related to the defense or counterclaim that is inconsistent with one or more of the defenses or counterclaims that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, shall be at the Indemnified Party's expense and shall not be eligible for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of other Loss suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of the Third Party Claim including the attorneys' fees and other expenses otherwise incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim.  If the Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, (a) the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b) should the Indemnified Party receive a binding written offer of settlement from the third party claimant to consent to or enter into a judgment, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim that does not impose any obligation or require any admission of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (other than the payment of monies for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder) and includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, stockholders and employees a general release from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party does not consent to or enter into such judgment, compromise or settlement, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that any Loss exceeds the amount that the Indemnified Party would have reasonably incurred had the Indemnified Party consented to or entered into such judgment, compromise or settlement.  If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter as above provided within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Indemnified Party described above, then the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend against any such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, with respect to no claim for indemnification pursuant to Article X (or as a part of a group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate from a common set of facts) shall the Indemnified Party be eligible for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party for the attorneys' fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel, plus local counsel, to the Indemnified Party.

Sellers agree that any access to the Purchased Real Property necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 10.03(b) will only be at hours and for periods agreed to by Buyers in their reasonable discretion and that such access will not materially interfere with Buyers' business activities conducted at such premises.  Buyers will reasonably cooperate with the implementation of any investigation, assessment, remedial or monitoring activities, to the extent such activities do not materially interfere with normal business activities conducted by Buyers.

Sellers will be deemed to have satisfied their obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Environmental Claim related to the Purchased Real Property when (i) the result meets or exceeds the least stringent standards provided by applicable Environmental Laws (including any standards based on the use of deed or land use restrictions, institutional controls and/or resulting from any site-specific risk assessments) subject to Buyers' rights to review and approve such standards, as set forth in the last sentence of this paragraph, based on the use of the property on the Closing Date and applicable Environmental Laws and (ii) with respect to any Environmental Claim initiated by any Governmental Authority, upon receipt of a "no further action" letter, site cleanup rehabilitation order or other written decision from any Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction over such Environmental Claim that no further investigation, assessment, monitoring or remediation is required by the Buyers (or Sellers if Sellers are the performing party).  Buyers acknowledge that resolution of any Environmental Claim may require the imposition of deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions and, so long as such restrictions do not materially interfere with the use of the Purchased Real Property as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or impose any material liability or obligation on Buyers, upon review of the proposed deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions, Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to the recording of any such restrictions by Seller.  Buyers' right to review and approve, as provided in the foregoing sentence, shall be limited to determining in good faith whether the deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions proposed by Sellers materially interfere with the use of the Purchased Real Property as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or impose any material liability or obligation on Buyers.  Buyer shall have the right to review and approve any standards provided under Environmental Laws that are proposed to be applied by Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (iv) to determine in good faith that such standards are consistent with and sufficient to satisfy the related Environmental Claim.
(iv)
                             
Satisfaction of Obligation
 
.  Each party will keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any investigatory, assessment, remediation or monitoring activities with respect to Environmental Claims and will provide the other party with copies of all
(v)
                                
Disclosure
material monitoring, sampling and other data relating to such matters subject to Buyers' rights as described in the proviso in Section 10.03(b)(ii)(A), (B) and (C).  Sellers shall provide Buyers, or cause Buyers to be provided with, true and correct copies (without charge) of all relevant documents and records which Sellers obtain or prepare in order to perform any remediation, investigation, assessment, sampling, monitoring, treatment, removal, cleanup or other action required to fulfill Seller's obligations under this Agreement (including by way of illustration and not limitation any Phase I environmental reports and any Phase II environmental reports).  Neither party will notify any Governmental Authority or third party of the existence or substance of facts and circumstances giving rise to an Environmental Claim except as required by Law or with the consent of the other party.  If a party believes it is necessary or appropriate, pursuant to a Law, to disclose any such information, that party will first promptly notify the other party of such requirement and the content and timing of any disclosure that it proposes to make unless in the reasonable judgment of the party circumstances and applicable Law require immediate notification.
 
.  As long as Sellers shall have any obligations to Buyers hereunder with respect to Environmental Claims, Buyers will not engage in, permit or cause any subsurface investigations at or adjacent to the Purchased Real Property, including sampling of soil or groundwater, except (1) in the ordinary course in connection with construction activities (including by way of illustration and not limitation obtaining any construction financing for any such construction activities or entering into any construction contracts wherein Phase I or Phase II environmental reports are required with respect to any such construction activities by Buyers) by Buyers at the Purchased Real Property; (2) in connection with the Release of any Hazardous Material when in the Buyer's reasonable judgment such Release requires any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports in order to ensure that such Release does not cause or has not caused an Environmental Claim; (3) in connection with any proposed sale, transfer, leasing, mortgaging or recording of other encumbrances, pledges or hypothecation of any of the Purchased Real Property or change of control, provided that any such proposed action is reasonably believed by Buyer to be probable to occur (collectively, a "") in the event the Buyers receive a written request in connection with any such Transfer by any third party to obtain any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports; (4) in connection with any pending or threatened claims of injury to person (each, a "") by any officer, director, employee, agent or invitee of Buyers or the reasonable belief by Buyers that any such person may have a Personal Injury Claim; (5) as may be recommended in a Phase I environmental report with respect to the Purchased Real Property, upon the written consent of Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; or (6) as required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to Environmental Laws to the extent that such requirement is not attributable to a request or notification by Buyers not required by Environmental Laws.

Investigations

Personal Injury Claim
 
.  Buyers' breach of Section 10.03(b)(vi) will relieve Sellers, to the extent of any Loss suffered or incurred by such breach, of its obligation to indemnify Buyers for any Environmental Claim if and to the extent that such breach is materially prejudicial to Seller's ability to remediate such Environmental Claim or otherwise prevents Sellers from discharging their obligations hereunder.
(vii)
                          
Buyers' Breach
Sellers shall comply with Section 10.02(a)(G) in exercising their rights and discharging their obligations under this Section 10.03(b).

After the Closing, this Article X will provide the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for the matters referred to in Section 10.02, other than as provided in Section 12.13.
(c)
                                 
 
.  Prior to commencing any action against the other party under or on account of this Agreement or exercising rights pursuant to Section 10.03(b)(vii), knowledgeable senior executive officers of each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall meet to discuss the dispute.  If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) days following submission of such dispute to such officers, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, each party may exercise any and all of its rights pursuant to this Agreement.  The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of a party to seek relief as provided in Section 12.13.

Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 19, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $.57 compared to $.47 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Such per share amount for the third quarter of 2005 includes the one-time effects of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt of $.02 per share and the one-time benefit of $.02 per share relating to the reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 34% to 33% resulting from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.    Sales for the third quarter 2005 increased 16% to $446,995,000 compared to $384,103,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $2.2 million in the third quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, diluted earnings per share was $1.67 compared to $1.31 per share for the 2004 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 were $1,300,032,000 compared to $1,126,483,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.4 million for the nine month 2005 period when compared to the 2004 period.
 
As previously announced, in the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities.  In conjunction therewith, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.4 million or $.02 per share after tax.  Such one-time expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements.  In addition, as noted above the Company has adjusted its effective tax rate from 34% to 33% to reflect the one-time benefit of lower United States taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings available under the provisions of the American Job Creation Act of 2004.  This lowered tax expense in the third quarter by approximately $2.2 million or $.02 per share.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our third quarter results.  Sales were up 16% compared to last year's third quarter to a record $446,995,000 and increased sequentially over the record second quarter 2005.  An excellent achievement in a seasonally slower quarter.   The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 18% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless, military and aerospace and automotive markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, our increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and acquisitions.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was up 9% over the prior year."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin increased from 18.3% a year ago to 19.3% in the third quarter of 2005.  This increase was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs.  Earnings per share for the quarter increased 21% over last year.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also strong at $67 million for the quarter."
 
"Last week the Company announced an agreement to acquire the Connection Systems division of Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE-TER).  Teradyne Connection Systems (TCS), a technology leader in high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products, is complementary and an excellent strategic fit with Amphenol.  The combination of TCS and Amphenol will create the world's third largest interconnect company and a new expanded platform for creating value.  We expect a closing prior to year end."
 
"It was a good quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter results in the range of $460 million to $470 million and $.59 to $.61 for sales and EPS, respectively.  The guidance
does not include any effect that may result from the acquisition of TCS.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 18, 2006.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $.61 compared to $.51 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2005 increased 26% to $508,115,000 compared to $403,963,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $10.4 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, diluted earnings per share was $2.28 compared to $1.82 per share for the 2004 period.  Sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1,808,147,000 compared to $1,530,446,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $7.0 million for the year 2005 when compared to 2004.
 
As previously announced, on December 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of the Connection Systems Division of Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE-TER) for approximately $390 million.  Amphenol TCS (TCS), headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products.  TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS has facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and employs approximately 2,000 people worldwide.  TCS was included in Amphenol's consolidated results beginning in December.  The fourth quarter includes TCS sales of approximately $35 million with no effect on EPS as incremental operating income was offset by incremental interest expense on borrowings to fund the acquisition.  TCS, a technology leader in high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect solutions, is complementary and an excellent strategic fit with Amphenol.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results.  Sales were up 26% compared to last year's fourth quarter to a record $508 million.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 89% of our sales,
 
was up a strong 27% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the mobile device market.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, our increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and acquisitions.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 11% of our sales, was up 14% over the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin in the fourth quarter was 18.5% compared to 18.8% in last year's fourth quarter.  Excluding the impact of the TCS acquisition which in December had operating income margins in the 7.5% range, the fourth quarter 2005 operating income margin was 19.3%, the same as the third quarter of 2005.  I am very pleased that we have been able to sustain this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment.  The increase in operating margins over the prior year was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs.  Earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% over last year.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also strong at $75 million."
 
"We had a record year in 2005 and look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, a strong position in diversified markets, and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  With the addition of TCS we are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe that we can achieve revenues and EPS in 2006 in the range of $2,250 million to $2,300 million and $2.56 to $2.63, respectively.  For the first quarter of 2006 we expect revenues and EPS in the range of $535 million to $545 million and $.57 and $.59, respectively.  As previously announced, we expect the TCS acquisition to be accretive for the full year 2006, but slightly dilutive in the first half of 2006.  EPS guidance for the year and first quarter of 2006 includes approximately $10.0 million ($.08 per share) and $2.0 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma 2005 EPS after option expense is $2.23, $.50 and $.60, for the full year, first quarter and fourth quarter, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
 
The Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results at 1:00 PM (ET) January 18, 2006.  The toll free dial-in number to participate in this call is 888-395-9624; International dial-in number 517-623-4547; Passcode: Reardon.

(1) - Subsequent to December 31, 2005 in accordance with the implementation of SFAS 123R the Company will expense stock based compensation.  Such expense was previously disclosed in the Company's financial statement footnotes but was not included as an expense in the Company's income statement.  Including the pro forma stock based compensation expense of $2.0 million and $7.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively would result in diluted earnings per share of $.60 and $2.23 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.

Item 8.01 - Other Events.
 
On December 1, 2005, pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") by and among Amphenol Corporation ("Amphenol" or the "Company") and Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("Teradyne"), Amphenol purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne's backplane and connection systems business segment ("TCS" or "Connection Systems"), including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of approximately $384.7 million in cash. In addition, Am phenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction related expenses.
 
Amphenol financed this transaction primarily with borrowings under its unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), dated as of July 15, 2005, among Amphenol, certain subsidiaries of Amphenol, a syndicate of financial institutions and Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent. As disclosed in Amphenol's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 21, 2005, Amphenol exercised its option to increase its aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement by an additional $250 million thereby increasing such revolving credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million. All other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement remained unchanged.
 
A copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement is included as an exhibit to Amphenol's current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on October 11, 2005.
 
Amphenol hereby amends Item 9 of its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 6, 2005, to file the Financial Statements and Exhibits of Amphenol related to the acquisition of TCS, (as described in that Form 8-K) and to file the required historical and pro forma financial information.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 
 

EXHIBIT 23.1
 
Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-8 (Nos. 333-86618 and 333-35901) of Amphenol Corporation of our report dated September 2, 2005 relating to the financial statements of Connection Systems, which appears in the Current Report on Form 8-K/A of Amphenol Corporation dated December 1, 2005.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
The Board of Directors of Teradyne, Inc.:
 
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related combined statements of operations, of parent company investment and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Connection Systems at December 31, 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of Teradyne, Inc.'s and Connection Systems' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Connection Systems is comprised of Teradyne, Inc.'s
high bandwidth backplane assemblies and high density connections
businesses, which were historically integrated with the businesses of Teradyne, Inc.; consequently, as indicated in Note B to the financial statements, these financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Teradyne, Inc., and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. Moreover, as indicated in Note B, the Company relies on Teradyne, Inc. for certain administrative services and financing. Accordingly, these financial statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Connection Systems had it been a stand-alone company.
 
 
 
 
 
A.    THE BUSINESS
 
The accompanying combined financial statements are those of Teradyne Connection Systems ("Connection Systems"). Connection Systems is a division of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Parent"). The accompanying combined financial statements include all assets, liabilities and expenses directly attributable to Connection Systems, as well as reasonable estimated allocations of corporate, general and administrative assets, liabilities, and other functions and services provided by the Parent. Connection Systems is a leader in high performance connection systems, including designing and manufacturing backplane systems, high-speed, high-density connectors and printed circuit boards.
 
The combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of results that would have been achieved had the Connection Systems operated as an unaffiliated stand-alone entity.
 
B.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying combined financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the business as included in the historical financial statements of the Parent. Connection Systems' costs and expenses include allocations from the Parent for centralized information technology, employee benefits, legal, accounting, real estate, insurance, treasury, financing and other corporate and infrastructure costs, as well as allocations for profit sharing and variable compensation (See Note P). Management believes the assumptions used to prepare Connection Systems' combined financial statements from the historical statements of the Parent are reasonable. The financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the combined financial position, operating results, changes in invested equity and cash flows of Connection Systems in the future or what they would have been had Connection Systems been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all the various units comprising Connection Systems, the Parent's net investment in Connection Systems is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the financial statements. The Parent has committed to provide financial support to Connection Systems to continue operations through September 2006.
 
Principles of Combination
 
The combined financial statements include the accounts of Connection Systems. All significant intracompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in combination.
 
Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of combined financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, intercompany cost allocations, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2004 are netted with parent company investment in the accompanying financial statements.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The volatility of the industries that Connection Systems serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Connection Systems maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically, taking into account the customer's current payment history, the customer's current financial statements and other information regarding the customer's credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Connection Systems customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
In accordance with the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," Connection Systems recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally passes to Connection Systems customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss passes upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Connection Systems defers revenue recognition until such events occur. Connection Systems classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject Connection Systems to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of accounts receivable. Connection Systems' customers are concentrated in the data and wireless communications, data server and storage industries and their ability to pay may be influenced by the prevailing macroeconomic conditions present in these markets. Receivables from Connection Systems' customers are generally unsecured. To reduce the concentration risk and the overall risk of collection, Connection Systems performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition.
 
Connection Systems markets its products principally in North America, Europe and South East Asia for use in computer and microelectronics manufacturing, data and wireless communications markets and industrial manufacturing. At December 31, 2004, Connection Systems had two customers that each accounted for 14% of total outstanding accounts receivable. Connection Systems performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and although Connection Systems generally does not require collateral, it requires its customers to provide letters of credit in certain circumstances. (See Note N for significant customer information.)
Inventories
 
Inventories, which include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Connection Systems uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Connection Systems records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a write down is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Inventories, net of related reserves, as of December 31, 2004 consisted of:
 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements and major renewals are capitalized and included in property, plant and equipment accounts while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense. When assets are retired, the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Connection Systems provides for depreciation of its assets principally on the straight-line method with the cost of the assets being charged to expense over their useful lives as follows:
 
 
Goodwill, Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
 
Connection Systems accounts for its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic life using the straight-line method and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," Connection Systems reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment, if any, contain management's best estimates using applicable assumptions and projections at that time.
Engineering and Development Costs
 
Engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Advertising Costs
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were $0.2 million in 2004.
 
Deferred Revenue and Customer Advances
 
Deferred revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because one or more of the conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order.
 
Product Warranty
 
Connection Systems generally provides a one-year warranty on its products commencing upon shipment. A provision is recorded to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based upon historical experience. Related costs are charged to the warranty accrual as incurred. The balance below is included in other accrued liabilities.
 
 
Employee Stock Option Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
Connection Systems applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation and complies with the disclosure provision of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"("SFAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for employee stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than the Parent's stock price at date of grant.
 
The Parent has stock-based compensation plans for its employees and directors. Pro forma amounts have been adjusted for the effect of recording compensation cost for the Parent's stock option and employee stock purchase plans for grants awarded to Connection Systems employees. The amounts have been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS 123 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and are presented below:
 
The weighted average grant fair value for options granted during 2004 was $14.30. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
 
The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted in 2004 was $5.52. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
 
 
Income Taxes
 
Historically, Connection Systems' results of operations have been included in the Parent's consolidated income tax returns. Income tax expense (benefit) reported in Connection Systems' statements of operations have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. However, the Parent managed its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses and its tax strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that Connection Systems would have followed or will follow as a separate stand-alone company.
 
Deferred taxes result from the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the recorded amounts of the assets and liabilities of Connection Systems for tax and financial accounting purposes. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent Connection Systems cannot determine, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"("SFAS 109") that the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is more likely than not. U.S. income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the United States.
 
Translation of Non-U.S. Currencies
 
Assets and liabilities, other than non-monetary assets and liabilities, of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, are remeasured into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the fiscal year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The functional currency for non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Revenue and expense amounts are remeasured using an average of exchange rates in effect during the year. To minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies, the Parent enters into foreign currency forward contracts. Net realized gains and losses resulting from currency remeasurement and foreign currency forward contracts are recorded by the Parent. Net amounts related to Connection Systems were not material.
Comprehensive Income
 
Comprehensive income consists of net income.
 
C.    SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION
 
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2004:
 
 
D.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). In annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to account for equity-based compensation using the intrinsic value-based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to record in their statement of operations equity-based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Connection Systems expects to adopt SFAS 123R beginning in the first quarter of 2006, as required, using the Modified Prospective method, without restatement of prior periods.
 
Currently, Connection Systems discloses pro forma net income and related pro forma net income per share in accordance with SFAS 123. Under SFAS 123R, equity-based compensation expense is required to be recognized in companies' financial statements.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs, and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Connection Systems does not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations.
 
E.     RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
 
Connection Systems future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These factors include, but are not limited to, the slowdown in economies worldwide, current geopolitical turmoil, the continuing threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, the current and anticipated market for electronics, risks associated with any measures Connection Systems has taken to address the past slowdown in the market, Connection Systems' ability to address a rapid increase in customer demand, failure to adequately protect Connection Systems' intellectual property rights, failure to develop new technologies and customers' failure to accept new products, risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures, material litigation, competition, including new product introductions from Connection Systems' competitors and competitive pricing pressures, risks of operating internationally, risks associated with an inability to attract and retain key employees, risks associated with Connection Systems' suppliers' failure to meet product or delivery requirements, risks associated with, among other things, obligations and potential liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, changes in product revenue mix, the ability of Connection Systems' suppliers and subcontractors to meet product and delivery requirements, the timing and level of customer orders received which can be shipped in a quarter and the timing of investments in engineering and development.
F.     GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
Goodwill
 
Connection Systems goodwill was $47.0 million as of December 31, 2004.
 
Connection Systems annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Connection Systems concluded during its annual test that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, goodwill was reduced by $2.0 million as a result of the return of escrowed shares related to the Herco Technology Corp. and Perception Laminates, Inc. acquisitions.
 
G.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Lease Commitments
 
Rental expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.8 million.
 
The following table reflects Connection Systems' non-cancelable operating lease commitments as of December 31,2004:
 
 
*      Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income of $0.4 million due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2003, Connection Systems entered into a sale and leaseback agreement for certain manufacturing assets. The lease agreement has a term of 24 months and expires in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the remaining minimum payments related to this lease agreement were $1.4 million.
 
Legal Claims
 
On April 30, 2004, Hampshire Equity Partners II, LP ("HEP") filed a complaint against the Parent and Connection Systems in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, relating to HEP's February 21, 2001 investment of $55 million in Connector Service Corporation (aka AMAX Plating, Inc.) ("CSC"), a supplier to Connection Systems at the time. After CSC filed for bankruptcy protection, HEP brought suit against the Parent and Connection Systems asserting fraud and negligence based claims, and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity, relating to statements that a Connection Systems representative made to HEP's agent during the due diligence that HEP conducted prior to its February 2001 investment in CSC. HEP sought to hold the Parent and Connection Systems responsible for its decision to invest in CSC, the losses that it suffered upon the bankruptcy of CSC and damages for an unstated amount of not less than $55 million. On June 17, 2004, the Parent and Connection Systems filed a motion to dismiss HEP's complaint in its entirety. On or about April 7, 2005, the District Court entered an order allowing the Parent's motion to dismiss in full and denied HEP leave to amend and re-file its complaint. On May 6, 2005, HEP filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's order to dismiss. The appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
On September 5, 2001, after the Parent's August 2000 acquisition of Herco Technology Corp. and Perception Laminates, Inc., the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against the Parent and two of its executive officers, including the President of Connection Systems, in the Federal District Court in San Diego, California. Pursuant to motions filed by the Parent and the plaintiffs, the District Court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to the breach of contract claims and denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. The only claim that remained before the District Court from the original complaint related to an allegation of fraud in connection with the setting of the transaction price. On December 27, 2004, the plaintiffs voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of their remaining claim in the District Court, without having received any payment or other consideration from the Parent. On February 2, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's prior orders. The appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
 
In 2001, the Parent was designated as a "potentially responsible party" ("PRP") at a clean-up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of the Parent's acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. Neither the Parent nor Perception Laminates have ever conducted any operations at the Los Angeles site. The Parent has asked the State of California to drop the PRP designation, but California has not yet agreed to do so.
 
The Parent and Connection Systems believe that they have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise, the Parent and Connection Systems believe the losses associated with these actions will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to their consolidated results of operations of any one period.
 
In addition, Connection Systems is subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. Although there can be no assurance, there are no such matters pending that Connection Systems expects to be material with respect to its business, financial position or results of operations.
 
Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations
 
Connection Systems enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most of these agreements require Connection Systems to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to Connection Systems' products. From time to time, Connection Systems also indemnifies customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur in connection with personal injury, personal property damage, product liability and environmental claims relating to the use of Connection Systems' products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of Connection Systems, its employees, authorized agents or subcontractors. On occasion, Connection Systems has also provided guarantees to customers regarding the performance of its products in addition to the warranty described below.
 
As a matter of ordinary business course, Connection Systems warrants that its products will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. Most warranties have a one-year duration commencing from shipment. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenue for estimated warranty expense based upon historical experience. As December 31, 2004, Connection Systems had a product warranty accrual of $0.6 million in other accrued liabilities. In addition, and in the ordinary course of business, Connection Systems provides minimum purchase guarantees to certain of its vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases, most of the guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, Connection Systems re-evaluates these guarantees and determines what charges, if any, should be recorded. Based on historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2004, except for product warranty, Connection Systems has not recorded any liabilities for these guarantees and obligations as of December 31, 2004 because no liabilities have been incurred.
H.    RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
 
The tables below represent activity related to restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2004. The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2010. Connection Systems expects to pay out approximately $0.8 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. A portion of the unoccupied space has been subleased as of December 31, 2004 and Connection Systems is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space.
 
The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2004 relating to restructuring and other charges:
 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, Connection Systems recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges:
 
      $2.3 million charge for estimates of losses due to changes in the assumed amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term;
 - 
      $1.3 million charge taken for severance and related employee benefits for approximately 43 employees terminated in the year; and
 - 
      $0.5 million of charges for certain long-lived assets that were impaired as the estimated value of such assets was less than the carrying amount.
 - 
 
During 2004, Connection Systems recorded a $0.9 million gain on the sale of a business related to an earn-out provision from a divestiture in 1999, which has been classified as gain on the sale of business in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
In January 2005, Connection Systems committed to a restructuring plan as part of an ongoing effort to lower expenses.

Through December 2005, Connection Systems has incurred charges of approximately $3.8 million, related to this plan.
 
On April 8, 2005, Connection Systems committed to a real estate consolidation plan and determined that an impairment charge would result from the consolidation plan. The plan includes selling an unoccupied building in Nashua, NH for which Connection Systems recorded an impairment charge of $1.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which ends April 2, 2006.

J.     RETIREMENT PLANS
 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
 
The Parent has a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of its U.S. employees. In addition, the Parent has an unfunded supplemental executive defined benefit plan in the United States to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code (the "IRC"). The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of total pension expense and total pension liabilities based on the portion of the Parent's plans which are estimated to be related to Connection Systems employees. Pension expense of $0.6 million is included in Connection Systems' statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Benefits under these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation. The Parent's funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of the U.S. defined benefit plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities.
 
Post Retirement Benefit Plans
 
In addition to receiving pension benefits, U.S. employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in the Parent's Welfare Plan, which includes death, medical and dental benefits up to age 65. Death benefits provide a fixed sum to retirees' survivors and are available to all retirees. Substantially all of Connection Systems' current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of total post retirement expense and total post retirement liabilities based on the portion of the Parent's plan which is estimated to be related to Connection Systems employees. Post retirement benefit expense of $0.7 million is included in the Connection Systems' statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
A $0.2 million asset is included in other long-term assets as of December 31, 2004 related to the defined benefit and post retirement plans.
 
K.    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
 
Stock Option Plans
 
As a division of the Parent, Connection Systems has no separate employee stock option plan, however, employees of Connection Systems participate in the Parent's stock option plans. Under its stock option plans, all of which are fixed accounting plans, the Parent grants options to purchase common stock at 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted to employees prior to September 2001 vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted to employees vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, in 2001, the Parent made a one-time option grant to all employees that vested over two years and has a term of seven years. The following stock option information relates to options granted to the employees of Connection Systems under the Parent's stock option plans.
 
Stock option plan activity for year 2004 follows:
Weighted average option exercise price information for year 2004:
 
 
Significant option groups outstanding at December 31, 2004 and related weighted average price and remaining contractual life information follows:
 
On May 26, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Parent approved a plan to accelerate on such date the vesting of certain outstanding, unvested "out of the money" stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under the Parent's various stock option plans. The stock options that were accelerated have exercise prices that are in excess of $13.26, the closing price of the Parent's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and range in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. Options to purchase approximately 733,768 shares held by Connection Systems employees became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration. By implementing the plan, the Parent expects to reduce the effects of SFAS 123R which requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
Under the Parent's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, certain Connection Systems employees are eligible to purchase shares of common stock through regular payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. Under the plan, the price paid for the common stock is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Parent's common stock on the first business day in January (July for new hires) or the last business day of December. In January 2005, the Parent issued 162,050 shares of common stock to Connection Systems employees who participated in the plan during 2004 at a weighted-average price of $14.55 per share. In January of 2004, the Parent issued 207,628 shares of common stock to Connection Systems employees who participated in the plan during 2003 at a weighted-average price of $11.67 per share. On November 9, 2004, the Parent's Board of Directors approved a plan amendment which replaced the existing twelve-month purchase period with two six-month purchase periods, effective January 1, 2005.
 
L.    SAVINGS PLAN
 
The Parent sponsors an employee retirement savings plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the Parent's savings plan, employees may contribute up to 15% of their compensation (subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations). The Parent annually matches employee contributions up to 6% of such compensation at rates ranging from 50% to 100% for employees in the defined benefit plan. For all other employees, the Parent annually matches up to 5% of such compensation at rates ranging from 100% to 150%. The Connection Systems employees' contributions vest 25% per year for the first four years of employment, and contributions for those employees with four or more years of service vest immediately. The Parent has also established an unfunded supplemental savings plan to provide savings benefits in excess of those allowed by ERISA and the IRC. The provisions of this plan are the same as the savings plan. Under the Parent's savings plans, $2.3 million was allocated to Connection Systems operations in 2004.
M.   INCOME TAXES
 
The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes for 2004 as shown in the combined statements of operations are as follows:
 
 
Significant components of Connection Systems deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:
 
 
Net deferred tax assets are recorded in long-term other assets as of December 31, 2004.
 
At December 31, 2004, Connection Systems has $124.6 million of U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards, of which $67.7 million expire in 2022, $52.6 million expire in 2023 and $4.3 million expire in 2004.  In addition, as of December 31, 2004, Connection Systems has foreign operating net loss carryforwards of $3.0 million, which have no expiration date.
 
Connection Systems has approximately $1.4 million of tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2004. General business tax credits of approximately $0.6 million expire in the years 2019 through 2020 and foreign tax credits of approximately $0.8 million expire in the years 2005 through 2007.
During 2004, Connection Systems' valuation account decreased by $6.4 million primarily as a result of the increased liability for tax depreciation and reductions in inventory valuations. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, except for certain foreign deferred tax assets, Connection Systems maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2004. Connection Systems does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, exists in order to conclude that realization is more likely than not.
 
A reconciliation of the effective tax rate for the year 2004 follows:
 
 
Connection Systems has tax holidays in Malaysia and the People's Republic of China. The tax holiday in Malaysia exempts 70% of trading income related to Connection Systems' assembly operations from income tax, with the remaining income taxed at statutory rates. The holiday will expire in September 2007, after which time all income will be subject to the statutory rate, which is currently 28%. The aggregate amount of savings relating to the Malaysian tax holiday is $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the People's Republic of China, Connection Systems has a tax holiday granting a 0% income tax rate through 2005, with an increase to 7.5% in 2006 and 2007. After 2007, the statutory income tax rate of 15% will apply.
 
As of December 31, 2004, a deferred tax liability had not been established for approximately $73.6 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("the Jobs Act"). The Jobs Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. There are approximately $60.0 million of unremitted foreign earnings considered available for repatriation. At this time, Connection Systems is exploring various tax planning opportunities, and does not anticipate repatriating under the Jobs Act. If Connection Systems were to repatriate these available earnings under the Jobs Act, the tax cost would be approximately $1.2 million.
 
N.    SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION
 
Connection Systems operates as one segment for the development and manufacturing of high bandwidth backplane assemblies and high density connectors.
 
 
(1)       Revenues are attributable to geographic areas based on location of customer site.
 
Because a substantial portion of Connection Systems' revenue is derived from the sales of product manufactured in the United States, long-lived assets located outside the United States are less than 10% of total assets.

A.    THE BUSINESS
 
The accompanying combined condensed financial statements are those of Teradyne Connection Systems ("Connection Systems" or the "Company"). Connection Systems is a division of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Parent"). The accompanying combined condensed financial statements include all assets, liabilities and expenses directly attributable to Connection Systems, as well as reasonable estimated allocations of corporate, general and administrative assets, liabilities, and other functions and services provided by the Parent. Connection Systems is a leader in high performance connection systems, including designing and manufacturing backplane systems, high-speed, high-density connectors and printed circuit boards.
 
B.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The amounts set forth in the accompanying combined condensed financial statements of the Company are unaudited as of October 2, 2005 and for the nine months ended October 2, 2005 and October 3, 2004, however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of such interim financial statements have been included. Such results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The accompanying financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 and include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the business as included in the historical financial statements of the Parent. Connection Systems' costs and expenses include allocations from the Parent for centralized information technology, employee benefits, legal, accounting, real estate, insurance, treasury, financing and other corporate and infrastructure costs, as well as allocations for profit sharing and variable compensation (See Note H). The financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the combined condensed financial position, operating results, changes in invested equity and cash flows of Connection Systems in the future or what they would have been had Connection Systems been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all the various units comprising Connection Systems, the Parent's net investment in Connection Systems is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the financial statements.
 
Principles of Combination
 
The combined condensed financial statements include the accounts of Connection Systems. All significant intracompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in combination.
 
Inventories
 
Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Connection Systems uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Connection Systems records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a write down is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Inventories, net of related reserves, as of October 2, 2005, consisted of:
 
C.    RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
 
Connection Systems future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These factors include, but are not limited to, the slowdown in economies worldwide, current geopolitical turmoil, the continuing threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, the current and anticipated market for electronics, risks associated with any measures Connection Systems has taken to address the past slowdown in the market, Connection Systems' ability to address a rapid increase in customer demand, failure to adequately protect Connection Systems' intellectual property rights, failure to develop new technologies and customers' failure to accept new products, risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures, material litigation, competition, including new product introductions from Connection Systems' competitors and competitive pricing pressures, risks of operating internationally, risks associated with an inability to attract and retain key employees, risks associated with Connection Systems' suppliers' failure to meet product or delivery requirements, risks associated with, among other things, obligations and potential liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, changes in product revenue mix, the ability of Connection Systems' suppliers and subcontractors to meet product and delivery requirements, the timing and level of customer orders received which can be shipped in a quarter and the timing of investments in engineering and development.
 
D.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Legal Claims
 
On April 30, 2004, Hampshire Equity Partners II, LP ("HEP") filed a complaint against the Parent and Connection Systems in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, relating to HEP's February 21, 2001 investment of $55 million in Connector Service Corporation (aka AMAX Plating, Inc.) ("CSC"), a supplier to Connection Systems at the time. After CSC filed for bankruptcy protection, HEP brought suit against the Parent and Connection Systems asserting fraud and negligence based claims, and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity, relating to statements that a Connection Systems representative made to HEP's agent during the due diligence that HEP conducted prior to its February 2001 investment in CSC. HEP sought to hold the Parent and Connection Systems responsible for its decision to invest in CSC, the losses that it suffered upon the bankruptcy of CSC and damages for an unstated amount of not less than $55 million. On June 17, 2004, the Parent and Connection Systems filed a motion to dismiss HEP's complaint in its entirety. On or about April 7, 2005, the District Court entered an order allowing the Parent's motion to dismiss in full and denied HEP leave to amend and re-file its complaint. On May 6, 2005, HEP filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's order to dismiss. Hearings for oral appellate arguments began on December 12, 2005 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals issued its order in December of 2005 denying HEP's appeal and affirming the District Courts order to dismiss.
 
On September 5, 2001, after the Parent's August 2000 acquisition of Herco Technology Corp. and Perception Laminates, Inc., the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against the Parent and two of its executive officers, including the President of Connection Systems, in the Federal District Court in San Diego, California. Pursuant to motions filed by the Parent and the plaintiffs, the District Court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to the breach of contract claims and denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. The only claim that remained before the District Court from the original complaint related to an allegation of fraud in connection with the setting of the transaction price. On December 27, 2004, the plaintiffs voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of their remaining claim in the District Court, without having received any payment or other consideration from the Parent. On February 2, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's prior orders. The appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
 
In 2001, the Parent was designated as a "potentially responsible party" ("PRP") at a clean-up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of the Parent's acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. Neither the Parent nor Perception Laminates have ever conducted any operations at the Los Angeles site. The Parent has asked the State of California to drop the PRP designation, but California has not yet agreed to do so.
 
The Parent and Connection Systems believe that they have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise, the Parent and Connection Systems believe the losses associated with these actions will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to their consolidated results of operations of any one period.
In addition, Connection Systems is subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. Although there can be no assurance, there are no such matters pending that Connection Systems expects to be material with respect to its business, financial position or results of operations.
 
Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations
 
Connection Systems enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most of these agreements require Connection Systems to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to Connection Systems' products. From time to time, Connection Systems also indemnifies customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur in connection with personal injury, personal property damage, product liability and environmental claims relating to the use of Connection Systems' products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of Connection Systems, its employees, authorized agents or subcontractors. On occasion, Connection Systems has also provided guarantees to customers regarding the performance of its products in addition to the warranty described below.
 
As a matter of ordinary business course, Connection Systems warrants that its products will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. Most warranties have a one-year duration commencing from shipment. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenue for estimated warranty expense based upon historical experience. As of October 2, 2005, Connection Systems had a product warranty accrual of $0.4 million in other accrued liabilities. In addition, and in the ordinary course of business, Connection Systems provides minimum purchase guarantees to certain of its vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases, most of the guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, Connection Systems re-evaluates these guarantees and determines what charges, if any, should be recorded.
 
Based on historical experience and information known as of October 2, 2005, except for product warranty, Connection Systems has not recorded any liabilities for these guarantees and obligations as of October 2, 2005 because no liabilities have been incurred.
 
E.     RETIREMENT PLANS
 
 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
 
The Parent has a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of its U.S. employees. In addition, the Parent has an unfunded supplemental executive defined benefit plan in the United States to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code (the "IRC"). The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of total pension expense and total pension liabilities based on the portion of the Parent's plans which are estimated to be related to Connection Systems employees. Pension expense of $0.4 million is included in Connection Systems' statements of operations for each of the nine months ended October 2, 2005 and October 3, 2004.
 
Benefits under these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation. The Parent's funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of the U.S. defined benefit plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities.
 
Post Retirement Benefit Plans
 
In addition to receiving pension benefits, U.S. employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in the Parent's Welfare Plan, which includes death, medical and dental benefits up to age 65. Death benefits provide a fixed sum to retirees' survivors and are available to all retirees. Substantially all of Connection Systems' current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of total post retirement expense and total post retirement liabilities based on the portion of the Parent's plan which is estimated to be related to Connection Systems employees. Post retirement benefit expense of $0.4 million and $0.5 million are included in the Connection Systems' statement of operations for the nine months ended October 2, 2005 and October 3, 2004, respectively.
F.     SAVINGS PLAN
 
The Parent sponsors an employee retirement savings plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the Parent's savings plan, employees may contribute up to 15% of their compensation (subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations). The Parent annually matches employee contributions up to 6% of such compensation at rates ranging from 50% to 100% for employees in the defined benefit plan. For all other employees, the Parent annually matches up to 5% of such compensation at rates ranging from 100% to 150%. The Connection Systems employees' contributions vest 25% per year for the first four years of employment, and contributions for those employees with four or more years of service vest immediately. The Parent has also established an unfunded supplemental savings plan to provide savings benefits in excess of those allowed by ERISA and the IRC. The provisions of this plan are the same as the savings plan. Under the Parent's savings plans, amounts allocated to Connection Systems operations were $1.3 million and $1.8 millionfor the nine months ended October 2, 2005 and October 3, 2004, respectively.

Parent Company Investment
 
Parent company investment consists of the Parent's equity investment in Connection Systems. Changes in the Parent's net investment represent the Parent's transfer of its net investment in Connection Systems, after giving effect to the net earnings of Connection Systems plus (minus) net cash transfers to (from) the Parent. The Parent's corporate debt and the related interest expense have not been allocated to the combined condensed financial statements.
 
I.      SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
On December 1, 2005, the Parent completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of TCS to Amphenol Corporation for
$384.7 million in cash, which includes a post-closing net asset value adjustment of approximately $5.3 million.

EXHIBIT 99.3
 
Explanatory note
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of Amphenol Corporation ("Amphenol" or the "Company") and Connection Systems ("TCS") for the periods indicated. The pro forma adjustments assume the acquisition of TCS was completed as of September 30, 2005 for the pro forma balance sheet and as of the beginning of the periods presented for the pro forma statements of operations in accordance with the terms of the Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") dated October 10, 2005 and financed with amounts drawn under the Company's existing revolving credit facilities. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The Company has also included a supplemental disclosure in Note 4 to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information. This disclosure presents a summary of costs that are not expected to be incurred in the future. These costs include nonrecurring restructuring costs, a nonrecurring gain on sale of a business and known cash savings realized at or immediately following the acquisition date relating to (1) reduced employee benefit costs and (2) elimination of allocations for centralized services by TCS's former parent company that will not be incurred by the combined company.
 
Amphenol accounted for the acquisition as a purchase using the accounting standards established in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, the excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. It is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment used in the accompanying pro forma combined condensed financial information.
 
The required unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the latest available fiscal year, is based on Amphenol's and TCS's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. The required unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the latest available interim period is based on Amphenol's and TCS's statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and October 2, 2005, respectively. The required unaudited pro forma balance sheet for the latest available interim period is based on Amphenol's balance sheet as of September 30, 2005 and TCS's balance sheet as of October 2, 2005.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in (1) the Amphenol Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, (2) the Amphenol Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and (3) TCS's combined financial statements included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A.
 
 
 
 
Note 1  Basis of Presentation
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information assumes that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of September 30, 2005 for the pro forma balance sheet and as of beginning of the period presented for the pro forma statements of operations and was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. It is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment used in the accompanying pro forma financial information.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is replaced with annual impairment tests. The Company will perform annual impairment tests to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the Company's recorded goodwill is necessary.

(a)
         
Reflects the benefit related to the reduction in cost resulting from Teradyne's pension plan, which was not assumed by Amphenol, as set forth in the following table.

(e)
         
Reflects the goodwill and identifiable intangibles recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting, as set forth in the following table.
 
Intangible assets and their related fair values consist of the appraised value of (1) license agreements ($6.1 million), (2) proprietary technology ($30.2 million) and (3) customer relationships ($9.0 million). These items constitute identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization. Value assigned to license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, determined to be 4 to 8 years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively.
 
(f)

In addition, the Company incurred approximately $8.8 million of related expenses.
 
Note 4  Supplemental Forward Looking Pro Forma Disclosure
 
To supplement our pro forma combined financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain measures which are adjusted from our pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current and expected financial performance and are "forward looking". The adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Company's operations and business environment. The following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and nonrecurring gains on the sale of a business which management does not expect to recur in the future. This information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company's ongoing combined operations.
 
 
In conjunction with the acquisition, TCS's historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCS's historic profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred.
(i)
           
Teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS. Such costs included information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services performed by Teradyne for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition.
(ii)
          
Teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at TCS resulting in related expenses. No significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future, and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore included above as expected savings.
(iii)
         
TCS had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005, which are not expected to occur in the future.
(iv)

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. April 19, 2006. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $.63 compared to $.52 per share for the comparable 2005 period. EPS for the first quarter of 2006 was reduced by approximately $1.8 million ($.01 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma first quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.50. Sales for the first quarter 2006 increased 39% to $568,991,000 compared to $409,395,000 for the 2005 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $10.1 million in the first quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to start 2006 with a record quarter achieving sales of $569 million and earnings per share of $.63. Sales increased 39% over last year and 16% excluding the TCS acquisition. This strong performance was broad based with growth in all major market segments; with particular strength in the wireless handset and broadband communications network
markets. The TCS acquisition performed better than expectations, achieving sales of $94 million and operating margin of 10%, contributing approximately $.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. I am extremely pleased with the progress TCS has made in its first quarter as an Amphenol company. The timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future performance. In addition, in March, consistent with our strategy, the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of interconnect systems for the medical equipment market with annual sales of approximately $20 million. The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering in this important market."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. The operating income margin in the first quarter was 17.3%. Excluding the impact of the TCS acquisition, and the impact of stock option expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, the first quarter 2006 operating income margin was 19.1%; compared to 18.9% in last year's first quarter. I am very pleased that we have been able to achieve this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment. The increase in operating margins over the prior year was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs. Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also strong at $56 million."
"We had a strong start to 2006 and look to the future with great enthusiasm. We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets, and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets. With the addition of TCS we are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2006 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,300 million to $2,345 million and $2.64 to $2.72, respectively. This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,250 million to $2,300 million and $2.56 to $2.63, respectively. For the second quarter of 2006 we expect revenues and EPS in the range of $580 million to $590 million and $.66 and $.68, respectively. EPS guidance for the year and second quarter of 2006 includes approximately $9.8 million ($.07 per share) and $2.5 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma 2005 EPS after option expense is $2.23 and $.56, for the full year and second quarter, respectively. We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

Third Amended 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries
In January 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Amphenol Corporation (the "Company") authorized and approved the Third Amended 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the "Third Amended 2000 Option Plan"), subject to stockholder approval at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). The stockholders of the Company approved the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan at the Annual Meeting held on May 24, 2006.
The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan increased the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under  the Company's previously-effective option plan from 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 shares. The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan also increased the number of options that may be granted to any one participant in the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan from not more than 2,000,000 to not more than 3,000,000 options. Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan will terminate in June 2010. All other terms of the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan are the same as the Company's previously-effective option plan.
 
The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee will consider recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management employees of the Company and determine those employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who will be eligible to receive options, the number and the terms and conditions of each option grant, the form of the option agreement and any conditions on the exercise of an option award. Options awarded under the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan will vest in 20% annual increments over a period of five years from the date of grant with certain exceptions including without limitation, in the case of the termination of the option holder's employment with the Company or retirement at age 65.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. July 5, 2006. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) announced today that it has incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York state during the period from June 28 to July 1, 2006. The Sidney facility primarily serves the aerospace and industrial markets. The Company is currently assessing the extent of property damage at the facility and the anticipated duration of business interruption. Preliminary estimates of flood related losses, in excess of related insurance coverage, are in the range of $15 to $30 million or $.11 to $.22 per share. Because of the recent occurrence of the flooding, this estimate is preliminary and subject to change as the Company is able to develop better information on the extent of the loss and its insurance coverage. The Company will reflect its best estimate of this loss in the results of its second quarter which ended June 30, 2006.
Significant cleanup and restoration efforts are well under way with full support from the Company's local employees and global operations, assisted by outside experts. The Company is committed to restoring full service to its customers as quickly as possible. Based on preliminary estimates the Company believes the facility will commence partial production early next week and ramp up to substantially full production within 30 days. Customer service and other administrative functions have already resumed activity pursuant to emergency operating plans. The Company will provide an update on the impact of the flood, the status of its recovery activities and related loss estimate at its regularly scheduled earnings conference call on July 19, 2006.
Amphenol Corporation is one of the world's leading producers of electronic and fiber optic connectors, cable and interconnect systems. Amphenol products are engineered and manufactured in the Americas, Europe and Asia and sold by a worldwide sales and marketing organization.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. July 19, 2006. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share, before flood-related charges, increased 19% to a record $.69 compared to $.58 per share for the comparable 2005 period. Such per share amount for 2006 excludes the effect of a $15 million one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility. Including such charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2006 was $.58. EPS for the second quarter of 2006 was also reduced by approximately $2.1 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma second quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.56. Sales for the second quarter 2006 increased 37% to a record $606,598,000 compared to $443,642,000 for the 2005 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $2.1 million in the second quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share, before flood-related charges, was $1.32 compared to $1.09 per share for the 2005 period. Including flood-related charges earnings per share was $1.21. EPS for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was also reduced by approximately $3.9 million ($.03 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma EPS for the six months ended June 30, 2005 after option expense is $1.06. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $1,175,589,000 compared to $853,037,000 for the 2005 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $8.1 million for the six month 2006 period when compared to the 2005 period.
 
As previously announced this month, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period June 28 through July 1, 2006. In the second quarter the Company has recorded a charge of $15 million or $.11 per share for property related damage net of expected insurance recoveries. This charge includes the Company's best estimate of the loss related to inventory and machinery and equipment. In the third quarter, the Company expects to record an additional charge of
 
approximately $5 million or $.04 per share for one-time expenses relating to cleanup and repair efforts, net of insurance recoveries. In addition, the Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14. This reduced sales by approximately $10 million in the second quarter and is expected to reduce sales by approximately $15 million in the third quarter. The Sidney plant management and employees have made and continue to make heroic efforts in getting the plant back into production and meeting customer needs; the plant is expected to be substantially back to full production next month.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to close a record second quarter with sales of $607 million and earnings per share before flood-related charges of $.69. Sales increased 37% over last year and 12% excluding the TCS acquisition. This strong performance was broad based, with particular strength in the wireless handset and broadband communications network markets. The accomplishment of these results in spite of the unexpected flood-related sales loss at the end of the quarter in the military and aerospace market is a testament to the strength and balance of the business. TCS continues to perform better than expected, increasing sales to $110 million and improving operating margin to 13%, contributing approximately $.07 to earnings per share in the quarter. The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added connector products and the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future performance."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. The operating income margin in the second quarter, before flood related charges, was 17.8%. Excluding the impact of the TCS acquisition and the impact of stock option expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating income margin was 19.2%; compared to last year's second quarter of 19.4%. I am very pleased that we have been able to achieve this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment. Furthermore, net income before flood-related charges, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability. Cash flow from operations for the quarter reached a record $87 million."
 
"It was another strong quarter and we look to the future with great enthusiasm. We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets, and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets. With the addition of TCS we are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, and excluding the flood-related charges of $.15 per share, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2006 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,375 million to $2,405 million and $2.75 to $2.83, respectively. After flood-related charges, EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.68. This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,300 million to $2,345 million and $2.64 to $2.72, respectively. For the third quarter of 2006 we expect revenues and EPS in the range of $595 million to $605 million and $.69 to $.72, respectively, before flood-related charges of $5 million or $.04 per share. EPS guidance for the year and third quarter of 2006 includes approximately $9.4 million ($.07 per share) and $2.7 million ($.02 per share), respectively, relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma 2005 EPS after option expense is $2.23 and $.56, for the full year and third quarter, respectively. We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet all challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 18, 2006.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to a record $.73 compared to $.57 per share for the comparable 2005 period.  Such per share amount for 2006 includes the effect of a $6 million or $.04 per share one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility and the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 33% to 32%.  Excluding the one-time flood related charge, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2006 was $.77.   EPS for the third quarter of 2006 was also reduced by approximately $2.8 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma third quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.56.  Sales for the third quarter 2006 increased 42% to a record $636,418,000 compared to $446,995,000 for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $8.4 million in the third quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share, including flood-related charges, was $1.93 compared to $1.67 per share for the 2005 period.  Excluding flood-related charges earnings per share was $2.09.  EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was also reduced by approximately $6.7 million ($.05 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 after option expense is $1.63.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $1,812,007,000 compared to $1,300,032,000 for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $.4 million for the nine month 2006 period when compared to the 2005 period.
As previously announced, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period June 28 through July 1, 2006.  In the second and third quarter of 2006 the Company recorded charges of
 
$15 million or $.11 per share and $6 million or $.04 per share, respectively, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of expected insurance recoveries.  The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14.  Production activity increased during the third quarter with the plant substantially back to full production during the month of September.  As a result, sales in the second and third quarter were reduced by approximately $10 and $15 million, respectively.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to close a record third quarter with sales of $636 million and earnings per share before flood related losses of $.77.  Sales increased 42% over last year (14% excluding the TCS acquisition), and were up 5% sequentially, an exceptional accomplishment in what is normally a seasonally softer quarter.  This performance was led by particular strength in the communications related markets which had strong sequential growth, and more than absorbed the flood-related sales loss in the quarter in the military and aerospace market; a testament to the strength and balance of the business.  TCS continued to perform as the market leader in high-speed, high-density printed circuit board interconnect solutions, increasing third quarter sales 15%, sequentially to $126 million and improving operating margin.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added interconnect solutions and the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future performance."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin in the third quarter, before flood related charges, was 18%, up from 17.8% in the second quarter, with sequential improvement in both the cable and interconnect segments of our business.  I am very pleased that we have been able to achieve this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was strong at $71 million."
"It was another strong quarter and we look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect a strong finish to the year and are raising guidance for the fourth quarter to revenues in the range of $640 million to $650 million and EPS in the range of $.80 and $.82, respectively.  EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of 2006 includes approximately $3.1 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma fourth quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.60.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

358 Hall Avenue
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 17, 2007.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 39% to a record $.85 compared to $.61 per share for the comparable 2005 period.  Such per share amount for 2006 includes the benefit of $.02 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 32% to 31.5%.  In addition, EPS for the fourth quarter of 2006 was reduced by approximately $3.0 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma fourth quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.60.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2006 increased 30% (16% excluding the TCS acquisition) to a record $659.4 million compared to $508.1 million for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.2 million in the fourth quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, diluted earnings per share, including flood-related charges of $.15 described below, was $2.79 compared to $2.28 per share for the 2005 period.  Excluding flood-related charges earnings per share was $2.94.  EPS for 2006 was also reduced by approximately $9.7 million ($.07 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma EPS for 2005 after option expense is $2.23.  Sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 37% (14% excluding the TCS acquisition) to $2,471.4 million compared to $1,808.1 million for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.5 million for the 2006 period when compared to the 2005 period.
As previously announced, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period June 28 through July 1, 2006.  During 2006, in the second and third quarter, the Company recorded charges of $21 million or $.15 per share for recovery and clean up expenses and property related
damage, net of expected insurance recoveries.  As previously reported the Sidney facility was substantially back to full production during the month of September.
The Company also announced that it will effect a 2 for 1 stock split for shareholders of record as of March 16, 2007.  The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on or about March 30, 2007.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "Amphenol has finished 2006 with another record performance with fourth quarter sales of $659 million and earnings per share of $.85.  Sales grew 30% over last year (16% excluding the TCS acquisition), and were up 4% sequentially.  Growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all geographic regions.  Our performance was led by particular strength in the communications related markets and an excellent contribution from the military, aerospace and industrial markets; as we came back to full production after the flood."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 18.9% in the fourth quarter, representing both a sequential and year over year increase.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added interconnect solutions and the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter to more than offset the difficulties of the current cost environment and provide a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $76 million and for the year was $290 million exceeding net income.  During the year we have continued to deploy our strong cash flow to create additional value."
"We had a record year in 2006 and we look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Our enthusiasm and confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to effect a 2 for 1 stock split in the first quarter of 2007, which should further improve the liquidity and trading in our stock.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe we can achieve revenues and EPS in 2007 of $2,650 million to $2,710 million and $3.45 to $3.55, respectively, an increase of 7% to 10% and 17% to 21% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood related charges, respectively.  For the first quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $635 million to $645 million and EPS in the range of $.80 and $.82, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 18, 2007.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 39% to $.43 compared to $.31 per share for the comparable 2006 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Such per share amount for 2007 includes the benefit of $.01 per share relating to a reduction in tax expense of approximately $1.5 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company's prior year tax returns.  Sales for the first quarter 2007 increased 14% to $651.0 million compared to $569.0 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $14.5 million in the first quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to have a strong start in 2007 with first quarter sales of $651 million and earnings per share of $.43.  Sales grew 14% over last year.  Growth was broad based and well balanced across all of our end markets and included all geographic regions.  Both segments of the business performed well in the first quarter.  The interconnect segment of our business (approximately 90% of sales) grew 15% over last year and the cable segment of our business (approximately 10% of sales) grew 10%.  Our strong growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 18.8% in the first quarter compared to 17.3% in the first quarter of 2006.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added application specific products together with a strong focus on the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future
 
performance.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was approximately 12% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $62 million."
"The first quarter was good in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2007 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,670 million to $2,715 million and $1.75 to $1.80, respectively, an increase of 8% to 10% and 19% to 22% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood related charges, respectively.  This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,650 million to $2,710 million and $1.73 to $1.78, respectively.  For the second quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $670 million to $685 million and EPS in the range of $.43 and $.45, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 18, 2007.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $.46 compared to $.35 per share for the comparable 2006 period before flood-related charges.  Such per share amount for 2006 excludes the effect of a $15 million one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility.  Including such charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2006 was $.29.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Sales for the second quarter 2007 increased 14% to $688.8 million compared to $606.6 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $13.0 million in the second quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, diluted earnings per share was $.89 compared to $.66 per share before flood-related charges for the 2006 period.  Including flood-related charges, earnings per share for the 2006 period was $.60.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $1,339.9 million compared to $1,175.6 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $27.5 million for the six month 2007 period when compared to the 2006 period.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to close a record second quarter with sales of $689 million and earnings per share of $.46.  Sales grew 14% over last year.  Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the military and commercial aerospace and automotive markets, and included all geographic regions.  Both segments of the business performed well in the quarter.  The interconnect segment of our business (approximately 90% of sales) grew 14% over last year and the cable segment of our business (approximately 10% of sales) grew 8%.  Our strong growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.4% in the second quarter compared to 17.8% in the second quarter of 2006 (before flood-related charges for the 2006 period).  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added application specific products together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost, contributed significantly in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was approximately 12% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $83 million."
"The second quarter was good in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2007 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,710 million to $2,750 million and $1.79 to $1.83, respectively, an increase of 10% to 11% and 22% to 24% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood-related charges, respectively.  This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,670 million to $2,715 million and $1.75 to $1.80, respectively.  For the third quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $680 million to $695 million and EPS in the range of $.44 and $.46, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. October 17, 2007. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $.50 compared to $.39 per share for the comparable 2006 period before flood-related charges. Such per share amount for 2006 excludes the effect of a $5.7 million one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility. Including such charge, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2006 was $.36. (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Sales for the third quarter 2007 increased 15% to $733.9 million compared to $636.4 million for the 2006 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.3 million in the third quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, diluted earnings per share was $1.39 compared to $1.04 per share before flood-related charges for the 2006 period. Including flood-related charges, diluted earnings per share for the 2006 period was $.97. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $2,073.8 million compared to $1,812.0 million for the 2006 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $43.8 million for the nine month 2007 period when compared to the 2006 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to close a record third quarter with sales of $734 million and earnings per share of $.50. Sales grew 15% over last year. Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the military and commercial aerospace, automotive and mobile device markets reflecting the impact of multiple new program ramp ups. All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter. During the quarter, consistent with our strategy, the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of interconnect products for the geophysical exploration industry with annual sales of approximately $35 million. We are excited
about the growth potential created by this excellent addition. Our strong organic growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.5% compared to 18.0% in the third quarter of 2006 (before flood-related charges for the 2006 period). The combination of strong top line growth based on value added application specific products together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance. Furthermore, net income exceeded 12% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $109 million."
 
"The third quarter was good in all respects. I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well. We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major customers in these markets. We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2007 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,814 million to $2,829 million and $1.89 to $1.91, respectively, an increase of 14% and 29% to 30% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood-related charges, respectively. This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,710 million to $2,750 million and $1.79 to $1.83, respectively. For the fourth quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $740 million to $755 million and EPS in the range of $.50 and $.52, respectively. We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $.55 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2006 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2-for-1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Sales for the fourth quarter 2007 increased 18% to $777.3 million compared to $659.4 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2007, diluted earnings per share was $1.94 compared to $1.47 per share before flood-related charges for the 2006 period.  Including flood-related charges, diluted earnings per share for the 2006 period was $1.39.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2007 were $2,851.0 million compared to $2,471.4 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $66 million for the full year 2007 period when compared to the 2006 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to close a record fourth quarter with sales of $777 million and earnings per share of $.55.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the mobile device, military and commercial aerospace, and wireless infrastructure markets.  All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter.  Our strong growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"Consistent with our strategy the Company completed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 with aggregate annual sales of approximately $45 million.  The acquisitions complement and broaden the Company's presence in a number of market segments and include a Northwest China based manufacturer of RF interconnect products for the wireless communications market
 
 
and a Chinese manufacturer of precision interconnect products for IT and consumer product applications.  In addition, during the quarter the Company completed the purchase of the remaining minority interest in one of its Korean manufacturers of handset related products.  We are excited about the growth potential created by these excellent additions."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.7% compared to 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The combination of strong top line growth based on value added application specific products together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $133 million."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major customers in these markets.  The growth we achieved in the fourth quarter and full year is very satisfying and is a direct result of implementing our strategies.  Looking forward, the general economic environment appears to have become more uncertain in recent weeks, particularly in the United States.  This weakness, combined with the relatively unstable financial markets may have a dampening effect on the expansion of certain segments of the economy.  Nevertheless, we believe the diversity of our customer base, leading technology, excellent product portfolio, worldwide presence and lean cost structure will serve us well in such an environment, and we are cautiously optimistic about continuing improvement in the short term and very confident about the long term outlook for continued growth and profitability. Accordingly, while market conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,100 million to $3,175 million and $2.18 to $2.25, respectively, an increase of 9% to 11% and 12% to 16% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the first quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $740 million to $755 million and EPS in the range of $.50 and $.52, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
 
The Company will host a conference call to discuss its full year and fourth quarter results at 1:00 PM (ET) January 17, 2008.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $.54 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the first quarter 2008 increased 18% to $770.7 million compared to $651.0 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $22 million in the first quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2008 with first quarter sales of $771 million and earnings per share of $.54.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the mobile device, wireless infrastructure, military and commercial aerospace markets.  All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter.  Our strong growth reflects the results of our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, during the first quarter of 2008 the Company completed the acquisition of a French manufacturer of value added interconnect and electronic packaging solutions for the aerospace market with aggregate annual sales of approximately $28 million. The acquisition broadens the Company's technology offering in this important growth market."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.5% compared to 18.8% in the first quarter of 2007.  The combination of strong top line growth together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's
 
successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $110 million."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  The growth we achieved in the first quarter is very satisfying and is a direct result of implementing our strategies.  While economic uncertainties are broadly reported, and despite a continued generally moderate demand environment in certain markets, we continue to see strength in our business.  We believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our increasing position with our customers in diverse markets, leading technology, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, while general economic conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,213 million to $3,258 million and $2.26 to $2.31, respectively, an increase of 13% to 14% and 16% to 19% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the second quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $805 million to $820 million and EPS in the range of $.57 and $.59, respectively.  We are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $.61 compared to $.46 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the second quarter 2008 increased 23% to $846.8 million compared to $688.8 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $26.5 million in the second quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $1.15 compared to $.89 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2008 were $1,617.5 million compared to $1,339.9 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $48.1 million for the six month 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report a record second quarter with sales of $847 million and earnings per share of $.61.  Sales grew 23% over last year.  Growth was broad based with particular strength in the global communications, military and commercial aerospace markets.  It is extremely rewarding that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, during the second quarter of 2008 the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of audio interconnect products for the military market with aggregate annual sales of approximately $14 million. This acquisition broadens the Company's technology offering in this important market."
 
 
 
 
 
"We are especially encouraged that, in addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage with an operating income margin of 19.9% compared to 19.4% in the second quarter of 2007.  We were able to more than offset significant inflationary pressures with the combination of our strong top line growth and a continued focus on all elements of cost.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $96 million.  The financial strength of the Company in the quarter provides a solid base for future performance."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment.  The growth we achieved in the second quarter is very satisfying and is a direct result of consistently implementing our strategies.  While economic uncertainties continue to be broadly reported, and despite a generally moderate demand environment in certain markets, we continue to see strength in our business.  We believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, while general economic conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,278 million to $3,308 million and $2.34 to $2.38, respectively, an increase of 15% to 16% and 21% to 23% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the third quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $825 million to $840 million and EPS in the range of $.59 and $.61, respectively.  We are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 16, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $.63 compared to $.50 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the third quarter 2008 increased 18% to $863.7 million compared to $733.9 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16 million in the third quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $1.78 compared to $1.39 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $2,481.2 million compared to $2,073.8 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $64 million for the nine month 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report record third quarter results with sales of $864 million and earnings per share of $.63.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based with particular strength in the global communications, military and aerospace markets.  It is extremely rewarding that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities."
 
"We are especially encouraged that, in addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter.  Amphenol achieved
excellent operating leverage with an operating income margin of 19.8% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2007.  We were able to more than offset significant inflationary pressures with the combination of our strong top line growth and a continued focus on all elements of cost.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $105 million.  The sustained financial strength of the Company provides a solid base for future performance."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment.  The third quarter results are very satisfying and are a direct result of consistently implementing our strategies."
 
"During the last month macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated further as disruptions in financial markets and lack of availability of credit have spread globally.  As a result, the outlook for economic growth has been reduced and the downside risk to growth has increased.  While the current environment is expected by many to have a dampening effect on demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, we are confirming the high end and narrowing the range of our 2008 guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3,292 million to $3,308 million and $2.36 to $2.38, respectively, an increase of 15% to 16% over 2007 revenues and 22% to 23% over 2007 EPS, respectively. This outlook is based on the Company's strong third quarter performance and a fourth quarter that incorporates the impact of current currency exchange rates which reflect a significantly stronger U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter 2008 we now expect revenues in the range of $810 million to $826 million and EPS in the range of $.58 and $.60, respectively.  Forecasting in the current unstable economic environment is difficult; however, we are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
 
The Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter results at 1:00 PM (EST) October 16, 2008.  The toll free dial-in number to participate in this call is 888-395-9624; International dial-in number is 517-623-4547; Passcode: Reardon.  There will be a replay available until 5:00 P.M.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  December 4, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) announced today that it is revising the fourth quarter 2008 guidance provided in its October 16 press release in light of the further slowdown in global demand within the last month.   The combination of this economic downturn, customer inventory reductions in response to tighter credit and lower demand expectations and a stronger U.S. dollar is resulting in reduced revenues in many of the Company's markets, particularly in the automotive, communications and industrial markets.
th
 
Accordingly, while forecasting in the current uncertain economic environment has become increasingly difficult, the Company now expects fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share in the range of $725 to $735 million and $.50 to $.52, respectively, a decrease of 5% to 7% and 5% to 9%, respectively from the fourth quarter of 2007.  Currency translation is now estimated to have the effect of reducing sales by approximately 5% when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "While demand has slowed and remains challenging to forecast, we are well positioned in our served markets to capitalize on the opportunities that are arising even in this uncertain environment. Our organization is continuing to take the actions necessary to preserve strong margins and cash flow, and will continue to proactively support our customers with leading interconnect technologies."
 
Amphenol Corporation is one of the world's leading producers of electronic and fiber optic connectors, cable and interconnect systems.  Amphenol products are engineered and manufactured in the Americas, Europe and Asia and sold by a worldwide sales and marketing organization.  Amphenol has a diversified presence as a leader in high growth segments of the interconnect market including:  Military, Commercial Aerospace, Automotive, Broadband Communication, Industrial, Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Mobile Devices and Wireless Infrastructure.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 15, 2009.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $.56 compared to $.55 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Such per share amount for 2008 includes the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 29% to 28%.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2008 decreased 3% to $755.3 million compared to $777.3 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 4% or $29.7 million in the fourth quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $2.34 compared to $1.94 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2008 were $3,236.5 million compared to $2,851.0 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 1% or $34.3 million for the full year 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Executive Chairman, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report fourth quarter results with sales of $755 million, operating income margin of 18.9% and earnings per share of $.56, a strong performance given the very challenging environment. On a local currency basis, sales were down about 9% sequentially from the third quarter of 2008 reflecting the sudden and severe slowdown in demand in most markets particularly in automotive and communications related markets.   Sales were approximately equal to prior year levels in local currencies with strength in global wireless communications and military and aerospace markets, offsetting declines in the automotive, industrial and IT and data com equipment markets. While our fourth quarter results have certainly been impacted by the well publicized economic slowdown, the results continue to show the significant benefits of the Company's diversity. In addition, it is extremely rewarding that even in this difficult environment, profitability and cash flow remain
 
 
strong.  Our experienced operating management team has reacted swiftly to the softening demand with a strong focus on cost reductions, including a headcount reduction of about 17% of our total workforce in the quarter.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment."
 
"Effective January 1
st
, in accordance with our previously announced succession plan, R. Adam Norwitt succeeded me as CEO of Amphenol.  I am confident that under his leadership Amphenol can look forward to a very prosperous future.  I will continue as Executive Chairman to support our mission to achieve our long term goals."
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt stated: "Consistent with our strategy, at the end of the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of a high technology manufacturer of antenna products for the wireless infrastructure market with annual sales of approximately $50 million. We are excited by the potential created by this excellent addition to our wireless technology offering."
 
"While economic conditions are uncertain and based on current currency exchange rates, we anticipate a further moderation in demand in Q1 2009.  Accordingly, we expect revenues for Q1 2009 in the range of $650 million to $665 million and EPS in the range of $.39 and $.41.  Forecasting in the current economic environment is increasingly difficult given the significant uncertainty regarding future demand levels.  As a result, until market conditions become more predictable, the Company will not be providing sales and EPS guidance beyond the next quarter. While the difficult economic environment has a dampening effect on current demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and dynamic entrepreneurial management."
 
"We continue to be excited about the futureThe strength of our management team and the sustained financial strength of the Company provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented, to preserve profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
.

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 16, 2009.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share of $.43 compared to $.54 per share for the comparable 2008 period.  Such per share amount for 2009 includes the benefit of $.02 per share relating to a reduction in tax expense of approximately $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company's prior year tax returns.  Sales for the first quarter 2009 decreased 14% to $660.0 million compared to $770.7 million for the 2008 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 3% or $23.1 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to the 2008 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt stated "We are very pleased to start 2009 with first quarter results that confirm once again the Company's ability to perform well in all economic cycles.  The Company's achievement of sales of $660 million, with operating income margin of 16.8% and earnings per share of $.43, is very satisfying given the challenging market environment. While these first quarter results have certainly been impacted by the global economic slowdown, our performance continues to show the benefits of the Company's diversity and the strength of its technology.  Significant sales declines resulting from continued low market demand levels in the automotive, industrial and information technology and data communication equipment markets were partially offset by sales increases in the global wireless communications markets, particularly in China, and a relatively flat performance in the defense and aerospace market.  Our team was able to capitalize on pockets of strength in nearly all of our served markets to preserve and grow our market position.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that even in this difficult environment, profitability and cash flow remain strong.  Our operating management team continues to adjust costs in a proactive and dynamic manner contributing to the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
"Consistent with our strategy, at the end of the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of Times Microwave Systems (TMS), a world leader in high performance radio frequency value-added interconnect technology for the military aerospace and wireless communications markets.  TMS had annual sales of approximately $108 million in 2008. We are excited by the growth potential created through the combination of our complementary technologies in these important markets. In addition, we are pleased that our financial strength allows us to continue to expand the opportunities for future growth through our ongoing acquisition program."
 
"While economic conditions remain uncertain, we anticipate a continuation of moderate demand in Q2 2009.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates we expect revenues for Q2 2009 in the range of $660 million to $675 million and EPS in the range of $.41 to $.43.  Given the significant uncertainty regarding future demand levels the Company will continue to only provide sales and EPS guidance for the next quarter at this time.  While the challenging economic environment has a dampening effect on current demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and an agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
 "We continue to be excited about the future.Our competitive advantages and sustained financial strength provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the challenges presented, to preserve profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee, agent and controlling person for any and all expenses (including the (subject to Section 8(c) hereof) reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; , that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however
 
(b)  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any
Indemnification of the Company and its Directors and Officers. 
loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of, and in the third and seventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. 
provided, however
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
 
(d)  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements. 
 
SECTION 9.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one
Contribution. 
hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in .  For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
Schedule A
 
SECTION 10.  If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such Notes set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters. 
Schedule A
aggregate principal amount of such Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives
with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.  Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
SECTION 11.  Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange Inc., or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange Inc. shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange Inc. by the Commission or the FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability

of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 12.  .  The Company acknowledges and agrees that:  (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees
No Fiduciary Duty
or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
 
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
 
SECTION 13.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter, or any person controlling the Underwriter, the Company, the officers or employees of the Company or any person controlling the Company, as the case may be, or (B) acceptance of the Notes and payment for them hereunder and (ii) will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 5, 2009, Amphenol Corporation (the "Company") issued and sold $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-162722), including the related Prospectus dated October 29, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated October 29, 2009.  The Notes were sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated October 29, 2009, by and between the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule A thereto.
 
The Notes were sold to the public at a price of 99.813% of the principal amount, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately $594.5 million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.  The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility.  In conjunction with the repayment, the Company expects to terminate certain interest rate swap agreements and incur a one-time charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.02 per share, relating to the cost of such termination.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and certain of the terms of the Notes were established pursuant to an Officers' Certificate dated November 5, 2009 (the "Officers' Certificate") in accordance with the Indenture.  The Indenture and Officers' Certificate contain certain covenants and events of default and other customary provisions.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year.  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2010.  The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1.  The Notes will mature on November 15, 2014.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  The Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 
The above descriptions of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein.

Until such waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of this Note is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of this Note or portion of this Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on this Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to such Holder's Note or portion of this Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date of the waiver becomes effective.  Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Holder of each Series affected by such amendment or waiver, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the Indenture.
Every amendment to the Indenture or the Securities of one or more Series shall be set forth in a Supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.

Each Holder by accepting the Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Note.
 
The registered Holder of this Note shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the Company at its written request.  After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such funds shall cease.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 21, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today fourth quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share of $.50 compared to $.56 per share for the comparable 2008 period. Such per share amount for the 2009 period included a one-time charge of $.02 per share relating to the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements as part of the refinancing associated with the Company's $600 million senior note issuance in November.   Such per share amount for the 2008 period included the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 29% to 28%. Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.52 and $.53 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Sales for the fourth quarter 2009 were $758.3 million compared to $755.3 million for the 2008 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 2% or $17.7 million in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the 2008 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share, excluding the one-time charge relating to the refinancing referenced above, was $1.85 compared to $2.34 for 2008.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2009 were $2,820.1 million compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $38.2 million for the full year 2009 period when compared to 2008.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to close 2009 with strong fourth quarter results that exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance.  This represents our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in sales and income, with sales of $758 million, an operating income margin of 18.3% and earnings per share of $.52 (excluding the one-time item).  The 6% sequential sales increase was driven by strengthening demand in most markets including: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Military/Aerospace, Industrial, Wireless Infrastructure and Automotive.  It is very gratifying that we have been able to enhance our market position in nearly all of our served markets. Our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to
expand the Company's growth opportunities.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that our focus on operating leverage and working capital management enabled us to further expand margins and generate strong cash flow.  Even with this improvement in demand, our management team continues to control costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"While overall economic conditions remain less than certain, we believe we have seen both an improvement in demand levels as well as a stabilization of demand patterns in most markets.  As such, in 2010, we expect to see a return to more traditional seasonality.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q1 2010 revenues in the range of $735 million to $750 million and EPS in the range of $.49 to $.51.  We believe we can perform well in the current environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"We continue to be excited about the future. Our significant actions in 2009 to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut, April 20, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.56 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amounts for both periods include benefits relating to a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating primarily to the completion of the audits of certain prior year tax returns.  Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.55 and $.41 for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Sales for the first quarter 2010 were $771.0 million compared to $660.0 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 2% or $15 million in the first quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to start 2010 with strong first quarter results exceeding the high end of the Company's guidance.  Orders of $829 million and sales of $771 million grew 8% and 2% sequentially, and increased 31% and 17% compared to the prior year.   The sales increase was driven by strengthening demand in a diverse range of our end markets including: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Automotive, Industrial, and Broadband. Our strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers enabled the Company to capitalize on an improving overall demand environment.  In addition, we are expanding the Company's growth opportunities through accelerated efforts to penetrate new markets, new customers and new applications.  We were especially pleased that our unwavering focus on operating leverage enabled us to further expand margins to 18.8% in the quarter up from 18.3% last quarter and 16.8% last year, contributing to a 34% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items.  Even with the improvement in demand, our management team continues to control costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash in all cycles.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $114 million."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, in early April, the Company completed the acquisition of an Asian manufacturer of specialty industrial interconnect products with sales of approximately $25 million.  We are pleased with this complementary addition and are excited about the growth potential in this important market."
 
"The first quarter was an excellent quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization which has executed well in all phases of the recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery.  While overall economic conditions have improved, the degree of recovery in 2010 remains less than certain. However, assuming a continuation of the current improved economic climate and based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q2 2010 revenues in the range of $820 million to $835 million and EPS in the range of $.60 to $.62."
 
"Looking forward, in an improving world economy, we see a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut, July 21, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today second quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.74 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amount for the 2010 quarter includes a $10 million, or $.06 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.68. Sales for the second quarter 2010 were $885 million compared to $685 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately ..4% or $3 million in the second quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, diluted earnings per share was $1.30 compared to $.86 for the 2009 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $1,656 million compared to $1,345 million for the 2009 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $12 million for the six month 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "The second quarter established a new record of performance for Amphenol, with sales of $885 million and EPS of $.68. Sales and EPS (excluding tax items) grew 15% and 24% sequentially, and increased 29% and 58% compared to the prior year.   The sales increase was driven by healthy demand in all of our end markets led by: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Industrial, Automotive, and Wireless Devices. We are especially encouraged that orders continued to be strong with a book to bill of 1.03.  Our strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a deep commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers enabled the Company to capitalize on the favorable market environment. Through implementation of our strategy, we continue to expand the Company's growth opportunities into new markets, customers and applications.  We are especially pleased that even with the significant improvement in demand, our management team continues to control
 
 
costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance. This focus on operating leverage enabled us to further expand margins for the fifth consecutive quarter to 19.8% in Q2 2010 up from 18.8% last quarter and 16.9% last year, contributing to a 58% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items. In addition, we generated a strong $104 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter, demonstrating the ongoing quality of the Company's earnings."
 
"Earlier this month, the Company completed the acquisition of Borisch Manufacturing, a leading U.S. manufacturer of value-add interconnect and electro-mechanical systems for the military/aerospace market with sales in the last twelve months of approximately $100 million.  This acquisition, is consistent with our long-established strategy of offering highly engineered, value-add interconnect solutions to military/aerospace customers, and creates further strength for us in this important market.  We are pleased with this complementary addition and are excited about the growth potential created in this important market."
 
"The second quarter was an excellent quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization which has executed well in all phases of the recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery.  While overall conditions have improved, worldwide economic conditions remain less than certain for the remainder of 2010. Nevertheless, assuming a continuation of the current improved economic climate and normal summer seasonality in North America and Europe, and based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q3 2010 revenues in the range of $880 million to $895 million and EPS in the range of $.67 to $.69."
 
"Looking forward, the continued proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing

available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.  If such Lender's share of the applicable Committed Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, on demand, from the applicable Borrower.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing.  Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii)           .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

Each Lender, the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate or form.
Status of Lenders
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(i)            properly completed and duly executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
 
(ii)           properly completed and duly executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) claiming an exemption for effectively connected income,
 
(iii)          in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto), or
 
(iv)          any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax properly completed and duly
 
executed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S.  withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction.  Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such  claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.  Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.

This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law it becomes unlawful, or any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company
 
through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Wallingford, Connecticut, October 20, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today third quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.78 compared to $.47 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amount for the 2010 quarter includes an $8 million, or $.05 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.73.  Sales for the third quarter 2010 were $948.5 million compared to $716.6 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 1% or $7 million in the third quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, diluted earnings per share was $2.08 compared to $1.33 for the 2009 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $2,604.2 million compared to $2,061.8 million for the 2009 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $5 million for the nine month 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "Amphenol achieved another record performance in the third quarter, with sales of $948 million and EPS of $.73 net of tax items.  Sales and EPS grew 32% and 55% over last year as the Company continued to build upon its position in its target markets.   Our strategy of market and geographic diversification, combined with a deep commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers, enabled the Company to capitalize on the favorable market environment and drive strong demand in all of our end markets led by: Industrial, Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Wireless Devices, Military/Aerospace and Wireless Infrastructure.  In addition, in an environment of increasing global inflationary pressures, our management team continued to proactively and dynamically manage costs creating excellent operating leverage and
 
expanding operating margins by 2.6% to 19.9% in Q3 2010 from 17.3% last year, contributing to a 55% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items. Further, cash flow from operations in the quarter was a strong $128 million, demonstrating the ongoing quality of the Company's earnings."
 
"The record performance we achieved in the third quarter is a direct result of the implementation of our strategies by our worldwide organization, which continues to execute well in all economic environments. While global demand has significantly increased in the last several quarters, there remains a degree of uncertainty in the worldwide economy. Therefore, on the basis of the current economic climate and assuming constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q4 2010 revenues in the range of $933 million to $948 million and EPS in the range of $.71 to $.73."
 
"Looking forward, regardless of any near-term economic uncertainties, the accelerating  proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created an even stronger base for Amphenol's future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

For the full year ended December 31, 2010, diluted earnings per share, was $2.82 compared to $1.83 for 2009.  2010 diluted earnings per share included a net benefit of approximately $.12 per share ($20.7 million), relating primarily to a reduction in international tax expense due to reserve adjustments and refunds from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions.  2009 diluted earnings per share included offsetting adjustments of $.02 each, relating to a favorable tax adjustment and the one-time charge relating to the refinancing referenced above.  Excluding the effects of these items, diluted earnings per share was $2.70 and $1.83 for the full year periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2010 were $3,554.1 million compared to $2,820.1 million for 2009. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $1.1 million for the full year 2010 period when compared to 2009.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer R. Adam Norwitt stated "We are pleased to close 2010 with strong fourth quarter results with sales up 25% and EPS up 42% over the comparable 2009 quarter.  Sales and EPS exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance and reached record levels of $950 million and $.74, respectively.  The 25% sales increase was driven
 
by stronger demand in nearly all of our served markets, led by Industrial, Mobile Devices and Military Aerospace.  It is especially rewarding that these results reflect a significant enhancement of our market position in essentially all of our served markets in 2010. Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  In addition, the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture drives an unwavering focus on profitability and cash flow, producing excellent operating leverage and a high quality of earnings.  Operating margins in the quarter were a record 20.1%, up 180 basis points from 18.3% last year; for the full year operating margins were 19.7%, up 240 basis points from 17.3% last year.  I am especially proud of this excellent accomplishment of our management team, particularly given the current challenging cost environment.
 
"During the last several quarters we have seen an improvement in global demand levels as well as a stabilization of demand patterns in all of our major served markets.  As such, in 2011, we expect to see a return to more traditional seasonality.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q1 2011 revenues in the range of $925 million to $940 million and EPS in the range of $.70 to $.72.  For the year 2011, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3,885 million to $3,960 million and $3.00 to $3.10, respectively, an increase of 9% to 11% and 11% to 15% over 2010 revenues and EPS (excluding one-time tax items), respectively.  We believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"We continue to be excited about the future.The accelerating proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol. Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to twenty (20) million shares of its Common Stock during the period ending January 31, 2014.

The price and timing of any such purchases will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions and stock price. The purchases will be funded by the Company's available cash, free cash flow and borrowings under the Company's credit facilities.

The stock repurchase program helps offset dilution from the Company's equity compensation programs.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Exhibit 99.1       Press Release dated April 20, 2011
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 20, 2011.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share of $.72 compared to $.56 per share for the comparable 2010 period. Such per share amount for the 2010 period included a $.01 one-time benefit from a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain prior year tax returns.    Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.55 for the first quarter of 2010.   Sales for the first quarter 2011 were $941 million compared to $771 million for the 2010 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $6 million in the first quarter 2011 compared to the 2010 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer R. Adam Norwitt stated "We are very pleased to report strong first quarter results with sales up 22 % and EPS up 31% over the
comparable 2010 quarter (excluding the one-time tax benefit).  The 22% sales increase was driven by stronger demand for our interconnect products, offset in part by a moderation in demand for our broadband cable products.  In our interconnect business, we experienced strength across nearly all of our served markets, led by Mobile Devices, Industrial, Automotive and Military/Aerospace. We continue to perform well in a dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, broad and increasing positions with our customers across all of our diverse markets, worldwide presence and lean cost structure. In particular, despite an extremely challenging cost environment, our entrepreneurial management team executed very well in the quarter, achieving 19.8% operating margins, up 100 basis points from 18.8% last year.    In addition, the Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, achieving cash flow of $108 million in the quarter."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with our strategy, in early April the Company completed the acquisition of a manufacturer of advanced lighting interconnect products for the automotive market with annual sales of approximately $50 million.  This acquisition adds to the Company's offering of high technology interconnect products for expanding electronics applications in automobiles, strengthening our position in this important market.  In addition, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value
including, in this quarter, the purchase of 3.4 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our new stock repurchase plan which was announced in January."
"Based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect second quarter 2011 revenues in the range of $985 million to $1 billion and EPS in the range of $.76 to $.78.  For the full year 2011, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3,955 million to $4 billion and $3.05 to $3.11, respectively, an increase of 11% to 13% and 13% to 15% over 2010 revenues and EPS (excluding one-time tax items), respectively.  The Company has not experienced any meaningful negative impact to its business thus far from the recent natural disasters in Japan. However, our guidance does not reflect any related potential future disruptions to the electronics supply chain that may occur."
 
"We continue to be extremely excited about the future.The accelerating proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol. Our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 20, 2011.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today second quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share of $.85 compared to $.74 per share for the comparable 2010 period. Such per share amount for the 2011 quarter includes an $18 million ($11 million after tax), or $.06 per share gain related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase price obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  Such per share amount for the 2010 quarter included a $10 million, or $.06 per share, net tax benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share were a record $.79 for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 compared to $.68 for the 2010 period.  Sales for the second quarter 2011 were a record $1,018 million compared to $885 million for the 2010 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $29 million in the second quarter 2011 compared to the 2010 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, diluted earnings per share were $1.57 compared to $1.30 for the 2010 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2011 were $1,958 million compared to $1,656 million for the 2010 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $35 million for the six month 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer R. Adam Norwitt stated "The second quarter results established a new record of performance for Amphenol with sales of $1,018 million and EPS of $.79 (excluding one-time items).  We are especially excited that we achieved a significant new milestone for the Company with quarterly sales in excess of $1 billion. Sales growth of 15% over last year was driven by strength across most of our served markets, led by Mobile Devices, Industrial and Automotive. We continue to perform well in a dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, broad and increasing positions with our customers across all of our diverse markets, worldwide presence and lean cost structure.  In addition, despite what continues to be an extremely challenging cost environment, our entrepreneurial management team executed well in the quarter, achieving industry leading operating margins of 19.4%, net income margins of 13.4% (both excluding one-time items) and operating cash flow of $105 million."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a steadfast commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's opportunities for growth.  In addition, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value including, in this quarter, the purchase of 3 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our new stock repurchase plan announced in January."
 
"Based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect third quarter 2011 revenues in the range of $1 billion to $1.015 billion and EPS in the range of $.77 to $.79.  For the full year 2011, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3.975 billion to $4.005 billion and $3.13 to $3.17 as reported ($3.07 to $3.11 excluding one-time items), respectively, an increase of 12% to 13% and 14% to 15% over 2010 revenues and EPS (excluding one-time items), respectively.  We continue to be extremely excited about the future.The accelerating proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol. Our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  September 8, 2011.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) announced today that it has incurred flood damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility. The Sidney facility primarily serves the military/aerospace market. The entire region has been severely impacted by high rainfall and the back to back impacts of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, resulting in an unexpected and historic rise in water levels as well as pervasive flooding in the region.  The Sidney facility incurred flood related damage in 2006 as a result of severe and sudden flooding in the area in June of that year.  As a result of the 2006 event, which was considered historic and unprecedented in the region, significant flood abatement actions were taken by the Company and state and local governments.  We believe these actions will help to mitigate the loss from this potentially even more severe flood.
 
The Company is currently assessing the extent of property damage at the facility and the anticipated duration of business interruption, including an estimate of the sales impact. Preliminary estimates of flood related losses, in excess of related insurance coverage, are in the range of $20 to $35 million or $.07 to $.13 per share.  Because of the recent occurrence of the flooding, this estimate is preliminary and subject to change as the Company is able to develop better information on the extent of the loss and its insurance coverage.  The Company will reflect its best estimate of this loss in the results of its third quarter ending September 30, 2011.
 
Significant abatement, cleanup and restoration efforts are well under way with full support from the Company's local employees and global operations, assisted by outside experts.  The Company is committed to restoring full service to its customers as quickly as possible.  Based on preliminary estimates the Company believes the facility will commence partial production early next week and ramp up to substantially full production within approximately 30 days.  Customer service and other administrative functions have already resumed activity pursuant to emergency operating plans.  The Company will provide an update on the impact of the flood, the status of its recovery activities and related loss estimates as soon as additional information is available, and in any event, at its regularly scheduled earnings conference call on October 19, 2011.

Wallingford, Connecticut. October 19, 2011. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today third quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share of $.79 compared to $.78 per share for the comparable 2010 period. Such per share amount for the 2011 quarter includes the effect of a $13 million ($8 million after tax), or $.05 per share one-time charge relating to the previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility. In addition, the 2011 quarter and the 2010 quarter per share amounts include $4 million, or $.03 per share and $8 million, or $.05 per share, of net benefits relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share were a record $.81 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared to $.73 for the 2010 period. Sales for the third quarter 2011 were a record $1.033 billion compared to $948 million for the 2010 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $23 million in the third quarter 2011 compared to the 2010 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30
th,
 diluted earnings per share were $2.36 and $2.08, on an as reported basis and $2.32 and $1.96 excluding one-time items for the 2011 and 2010 periods, respectively. Onetime items in the 2011 period of $.04 include the $.02 net third quarter charge described above and a $.06 per share gain related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase price obligation for a 2010 acquisition. One-time items in the 2010 period of $.12 per share relate to the net tax benefit from a reduction in international tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $2.991 billion compared to $2.604 billion for the 2010 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $58 million for the nine month 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
 
As previously announced last month, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period September 7 through September 9, 2011. In the third quarter the Company has recorded a charge of $13 million or $.05 per share for property-related damage, as well as cleanup and repair efforts, net of expected insurance recoveries. This charge includes the Company's best estimate of the loss related to inventory and machinery and equipment. In the fourth quarter, the Company expects to record an additional charge of approximately $7 million or $.03 per share for one-time expenses related to remaining cleanup and repair efforts. In addition, the Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity in September and is ramping up to full production levels during October. This reduced sales by approximately $11 million in the third quarter and is expected to reduce sales by approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer R. Adam Norwitt stated "The third quarter results established new records of performance for Amphenol with sales of $1.033 billion and EPS of $.81 (excluding one-time items). Sales growth of 9% over last year was driven primarily by strength in our Mobile Devices and Automotive markets. Demand in the Mobile Devices market was particularly strong, and we believe included some pulling forward by customers of deliveries previously planned for the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the Company's strong performance despite growing economic uncertainties, a confirmation of the strength of our leading technology, broad and increasing positions with our customers across all of our diverse markets, worldwide presence and lean cost structure. In addition, despite what continues to be an extremely challenging environment, our entrepreneurial management team executed well in the quarter, achieving industry-leading operating margins of 19.3%, net income margins of 13.4% (both excluding one-time items) and strong operating cash flow of $184 million."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a steadfast commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's opportunities for growth. In addition, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value including, in this quarter, the purchase of 3.8 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan."
 
"I am particularly proud of the efforts of our Sidney, New York team, whose heroic recovery efforts following the flood have allowed us to make significant strides in the resumption of production in satisfaction of our customers' needs. We are especially pleased that the Sidney plant is expected to be substantially back to full production this month. This team is a tremendous example of Amphenol's outstanding organization."
 
"In the past month, global markets have been impacted by a higher level of uncertainty surrounding fiscal and budgetary issues in most developed economies. As a result, we have begun to see increased levels of caution from many of our customers, translating into lower demand in most markets. In addition, we do not expect a continuation in the fourth quarter of the increased demand levels in the Mobile Devices market that we experienced in the third quarter. In consideration of this and based on the assumption of constant currency exchange rates including a relatively weaker euro, we expect fourth quarter 2011 revenues in the range of $920 million to $940 million and EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $.69 to $.71. For the full year 2011, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3.912 billion to $3.932 billion and $3.02 to $3.04 as reported ($3.01 to $3.03 excluding one-time items), respectively, an increase over the prior year of 10% to 11 % in revenues and 11% to 12% in EPS (excluding one-time items), respectively. This compares to prior guidance of $3.975 billion to $4.005 billion in sales and $3.07 to $3.11 in EPS excluding one-time items."
 
"Despite the increased level of economic uncertainty, we continue to be extremely excited about the future. The electronics revolution continues unabated in all of our end markets, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving accelerated demand for our leading interconnect technologies. This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."

Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 18, 2012.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today fourth quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share of $.69 compared to $.74 per share for the comparable 2010 period.  Such per share amount for the 2011 period included one-time charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax), or a $.03 per share charge relating to the previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility described further below ("Flood Loss"), and a $2 million ($2 million after tax), or $.01 per share charge for acquisition related transaction costs associated with the November acquisition described below ("Acquisition Costs").  Excluding these charges, diluted earnings per share was $.73 for the fourth quarter of 2011.   Sales for the fourth quarter 2011 were $949 million compared to $950 million for the 2010 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the 2010 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, diluted earnings per share was $3.05 compared to $2.82 for 2010.  2011 diluted earnings per share excluding the following one-time items was also $3.05 per share: (1) a $21 million ($13 million after tax), or $.08 per share charge relating to the Flood Loss, (2) a $2 million ($2 million after tax) or $.01 per share charge for Acquisition Costs, (3) a $.03 per share ($4 million) benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense due to reserve adjustments and refunds from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and (4) a gain of $18 million ($11 million after tax), or $.06 per share, related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  2010 diluted earnings per share included a net benefit of approximately $.12 per share ($21 million), relating primarily to a reduction in international tax expense due to reserve adjustments and refunds from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions. Excluding the effects of these items, diluted earnings per share was $3.05 and $2.70 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $3,940 million compared to $3,554 million for 2010.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $60 million for the full year 2011 period when compared to 2010.
 
As previously announced, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period September 7 through September 9, 2011.  In the third quarter the Company recorded a charge of $13 million or $.05 per share for property-related damage, as well as cleanup and repair efforts, net of expected insurance recoveries.  This charge included the Company's best estimate of the loss related to inventory and machinery and equipment.  In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an additional charge of approximately $9 million or $.03 per share for one-time charges related to remaining cleanup and repair efforts.  The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity in September and was ramping up to full production levels during October.  This limited activity reduced sales by approximately $11 million in the third quarter and approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer R. Adam Norwitt stated "We are pleased to report strong performance in a very challenging environment in the quarter with fourth quarter sales of $949 million, operating income margin (excluding one-time items) of 18.5% and earnings per share (excluding one-time items) of $.73.  Global markets have been impacted by a higher level of uncertainty related in part to the fiscal and budgetary issues in many developed economies.  As a result, as expected, many of our customers exercised increased levels of caution in the quarter, translating into lower demand in most markets.  Accordingly, sales were down approximately 8% sequentially from the record third quarter of 2011 reflecting this slowdown in demand, particularly in communications related markets.  Sales were approximately equal to prior year levels with strength in mobile devices, automotive, commercial aerospace and industrial markets, offsetting declines in the defense market and in the communication equipment markets including wireless infrastructure, IT and data com and broadband.  While our fourth quarter results have certainly been impacted by these lower demand levels, our performance continues to show the significant benefits of the Company's diversity.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability and cash flow which have remained strong even in this difficult environment.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a very challenging environment."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in late November, the Company completed the acquisition of FEP, a German manufacturer of high technology interconnect products for the automotive market with annual sales of approximately $120 million.  This acquisition adds to the Company's increasingly diverse offering of interconnect products for the many expanding electronic applications in automobiles, strengthening our position in this important market.  The Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value including, in this quarter, the purchase of 3 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.  In addition, as previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.105 per share effective for dividends paid after March 2012."
 
"While recent sales levels have been impacted by lower overall customer demand, order levels indicate a more positive demand profile with a 1.04 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter and orders up 4% from prior year levels.  In consideration of this and based on the assumption of constant currency exchange rates including a relatively weaker euro, we expect Q1 2012 revenues in the range of $960  million to $975 million and EPS in the range of $.73 to $.76.  For the year 2012, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $4,050 million to $4,150 million and $3.23  to $3.34, respectively, an increase of 3% to 5% and 6% to 10% over 2011 revenues and EPS (excluding 2011 one-time items), respectively.  We believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"While 2011 has ended amidst an environment of increased economic uncertainty, we continue to be extremely excited about the future.  The electronics revolution continues unabated in all of our end markets, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving accelerated demand for our leading interconnect technologies.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.  Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

(b)  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of, and in the third and seventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Company and its Directors and Officers. 
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. 
provided, however
 
(d)  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements. 
SECTION 9.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution. 
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in .
Schedule A
For purposes of this Section 9, each affiliate, director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
SECTION 10.  If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such Notes set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters. 
Schedule A
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.  Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
SECTION 11.  Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange Inc., or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange Inc. shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange Inc. by the Commission or the FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial, political or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services.
Termination of this Agreement. 
Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 12.  .  The Company acknowledges and agrees that:  (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
No Fiduciary Duty
 
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
 
SECTION 13.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter, or any person controlling the Underwriter, the Company, the officers or employees of the Company or any person controlling the Company, as the case may be, or (B) acceptance of the Notes and payment for them hereunder and (ii) will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.

Item 1.01
              
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 26, 2012, Amphenol Corporation (the "Company") issued and sold $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-162722), including the related Prospectus dated October 29, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated January 19, 2012.  The Notes were sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 19, 2012, by and between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule A thereto.
 
The Notes were sold to the public at a price of 99.746% of the principal amount, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately $494.6 million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.  The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and certain of the terms of the Notes were established pursuant to an Officers' Certificate dated January 26, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate") in accordance with the Indenture.  The Indenture and Officers' Certificate contain certain covenants and events of default and other customary provisions.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per year.  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2012.  The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15.  The Notes will mature on February 1, 2022.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus (if redeemed prior to November 1, 2021 (3 months prior to the maturity date)), a make-whole premium.  The Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 
The above descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, which are filed as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein.

A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Note or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  Each Holder by accepting the Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Note.
 
The registered Holder of this Note shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated January 19, 2012 between the Company and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters") (the "Agreement").  The Notes are being issued under the Indenture dated as of November 5, 2009 between The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Company (including the form and terms of the Notes established in an Officers' Certificate dated January 26, 2012 pursuant to Section 2.2 thereof, the "Indenture").
 
We have reviewed (a) the Agreement, (b) the Indenture, (c) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-162722) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company to register the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and (d) the Prospectus dated October 29, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated January 19, 2012, relating to the offer and sale of the Notes (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus") filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Act. We have also reviewed such other agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials, and have satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have considered relevant or necessary as a basis for this opinion.
 
In such review, we have assumed the accuracy and completeness of all agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials submitted to us, the conformity with the originals of all such materials submitted to us as copies (whether or not certified and including facsimiles), the authenticity of the originals of such materials and all materials submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all natural persons. In delivering this opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, as to factual matters, on certificates and other written or oral statements of governmental and other public officials and of officers and other representatives of the Company, the Underwriters and the Trustee.
 
 
On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be subject to and limited by the effect of (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and transfer, receivership, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally, (b) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) requirements of reasonableness, good faith, materiality and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any matter may be brought.
 
This opinion is limited to the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and the incorporation thereof in the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus.

Wallingford, Connecticut. April 18, 2012.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share of $.77 compared to $.72 per share for the comparable 2011 period.  Sales for the first quarter 2012 were $982 million compared to $941 million for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $4 million in the first quarter 2012 compared to the 2011 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report a strong start to 2012 with first quarter sales of $982 million, operating income margin of 18.9% and diluted earnings per share of $.77. Sales were up approximately 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, strength in automotive, commercial aerospace, broadband communications and industrial markets offset declines in the defense and wireless markets, reflecting the significant benefits of the Company's diversity.  We are especially encouraged to have achieved record orders of $1.028 billion in the first quarter.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability, resulting in a sequential operating margin improvement of 40 basis points to 18.9% in Q1 2012.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in early April, the Company completed the acquisition of Nelson-Dunn, a U.S. manufacturer of high-technology, value-added interconnect assemblies for the oil and gas market with annual sales of approximately $45 million.  This acquisition complements and strengthens the Company's industry-leading offering of harsh environment products for the fast-growing energy markets. The Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value including, in this quarter, the purchase of 1.5 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.  In addition, as previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.105 per share effective for dividends paid after March 2012."
 
"Based on the assumption of stable economic conditions and constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q2 2012 revenues in the range of $1.040 billion to $1.055 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $.82 to $.85.  For the year 2012, we now expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.105 billion to $4.190 billion and $3.30  to $3.38, respectively, an increase of 4% to 6% and 8% to 11% over 2011 revenues and diluted EPS (excluding 2011 one-time items), respectively. This compares to prior full year 2012 guidance for revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.050 billion to $4.150 billion and $3.23 to $3.34, respectively.  We believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Exhibit 99.1          Press Release dated July 18, 2012
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut, July 18, 2012.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today second quarter 2012 record diluted earnings per share of $.86 compared to $.85 per share for the comparable 2011 period.  Such per share amount for the 2011 quarter includes an $18 million ($11 million after tax), or $.06 per share, gain related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase price obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.79 for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.  Sales for the second quarter 2012 were a record $1.061 billion compared to $1.018 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $19 million in the second quarter 2012 compared to the 2011 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, diluted earnings per share were $1.63 compared to $1.57 for the 2011 period.  Excluding the effect of the adjustment above, diluted earnings per share was $1.51 for the six months ended June 30, 2011.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were $2.043 billion compared to $1.958 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $23 million for the six month 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report new records of performance in the second quarter of 2012 with sales and EPS of $1.061 billion and $.86, respectively.  Sales increased by approximately 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, strength in the automotive, industrial, commercial aerospace and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets offset declines in the defense and wireless markets.  This is once again confirmation of the significant benefits of the Company's diversity, especially given the uncertain environment in many of the world's economies. In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability, resulting in another sequential operating margin improvement of 50 basis points to 19.4% in Q2 2012.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in the second quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of the Deutgen Group, a German manufacturer of high-technology, precision injection molded components primarily for automotive applications with annual sales of approximately $25 million.  This acquisition expands the Company's product portfolio, in particular providing new expertise in advanced injection molding technologies for demanding applications in vehicles. In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of other ways to increase shareholder value.  These include the purchase in this quarter of 2.1 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan as well as the previously announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $.105 per share effective for dividends paid after March 2012."
 
"Based on the assumption of stable economic conditions and current currency exchange rates including a relatively weaker euro, we expect third quarter 2012 revenues in the range of $1.080 billion to $1.100 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $.87 to $.90.  For the full year 2012, we now expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.210 billion to $4.250 billion and $3.38 to $3.44, respectively, an increase of 7% to 8% and 11% to 13% over 2011 revenues and diluted EPS (excluding 2011 one-time items), respectively. This compares to prior full year 2012 guidance for revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.105 billion to $4.190 billion and $3.30 to $3.38, respectively.  Despite the widely reported uncertainties in many global economies, we believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.  Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.

Wallingford Connecticut, October 17, 2012.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today third quarter 2012 record diluted earnings per share of $.90 compared to $.79 per share for the comparable 2011 period.  Such per share amount for the 2011 quarter includes the effect of a $13 million ($8 million after tax), or $.05 per share one-time charge relating to flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility and a $4 million, or $.03 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.81 for the 2011 period. Sales for the third quarter 2012 were a record $1.103 billion compared to $1.033 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $19 million in the third quarter 2012 compared to the 2011 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, diluted earnings per share were $2.53 compared to $2.36 for the 2011 period on an as reported basis and $2.32 for the 2011 period excluding one-time items. One-time items in the 2011 period of $.04 include the $.02 net third quarter charge described above and a $.06 per share gain related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase price obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $3.146 billion compared to $2.991 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $42 million for the nine month 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report new records of performance in the third quarter of 2012 with sales and EPS of $1.103 billion and $.90, respectively.  Sales increased by approximately 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced strength in the automotive, industrial, commercial aerospace and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets.  On a sequential basis the Company saw strong growth in mobile devices primarily related to ramp ups of new mobile computing devices.  Our strong growth is once again confirmation of the significant benefits of the Company's diversity, especially given the increasing level of uncertainty in many of the world's economies.
 
In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability and cash flow, resulting in another sequential operating margin improvement to 19.5% and strong operating cash flow in the quarter of $176 million.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, the Company completed the acquisitions of Holland Electronics, a leading U.S. supplier of interconnect products for the broadband and satellite communications markets with annual sales of approximately $60 million, and Griffith Enterprises, a U.S. manufacturer of high-technology, value-added assemblies, primarily for commercial aerospace applications, with annual sales of approximately $15 million.  These acquisitions significantly enhance the Company's product portfolio in two important end markets providing new highly-engineered interconnect solutions to complement our broadband cable offering and expanding our value-add solutions for the fast growing commercial air market.  In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of other ways to increase shareholder value.  These include the purchase in this quarter of .5 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan as well as the previously announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $.105 per share effective for dividends paid after March 2012."
 
"In recent months there has been an increasing level of market uncertainty related to a range of fiscal and budgetary issues.  Based on these considerations and assuming current currency exchange rates we expect fourth quarter 2012 revenues in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.115 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $.88 to $.91  For the full year 2012, we now expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.241 billion to $4.261 billion and $3.41  to $3.44, respectively, an increase in revenues of 8% and in diluted EPS (excluding one-time items), of 12% to 13% over 2011. This compares to prior full year 2012 guidance for revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.210 billion to $4.250 billion and $3.38 to $3.44, respectively.  Despite the many uncertainties in the global marketplace, we believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to a constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

Wallingford Connecticut, January 17, 2013.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today fourth quarter 2012 record diluted earnings per share, before one-time charges, of $.94 compared to $.73 per share for the comparable 2011 period.  On an as reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $.86 and $.69 for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Such per share amount for the 2012 period includes one-time charges of $.08 per share comprised of acquisition related transaction costs (Acquisition Costs) of $2 million ($2 million after tax) or $.01 per share relating to 2012 acquisitions; and income tax costs of $11 million or $.07 per share resulting from the delay, by the U. S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income.  Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012.  Under U.S. GAAP, the related benefit to the Company of $11 million or $.07 per share relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a one-time benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement; as such, between the two quarters, there is no net impact on the Company from an income statement perspective.  Such per share amount for the 2011 period included one-time charges of $.04 comprised of $9 million ($5 million after tax), or a $.03 per share charge relating to the previously reported flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility (Flood Loss), and a $2 million ($2 million after tax), or $.01 per share charge for Acquisition Costs.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2012 were a record $1.146 billion compared to $949 million for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the 2011 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2012, diluted earnings per share excluding one-time charges was $3.47 compared to $3.05 for the 2011 period.  On an as reported basis, 2012 diluted earnings per share of $3.39 includes one-time charges of $.08 per share described above and 2011 diluted earnings per share of $3.05 includes the following one-time items: (1) a $21 million ($13 million after tax), or $.08 per share charge relating to the Flood Loss, (2) a $2 million ($2 million after tax) or $.01 per share charge for Acquisition Costs, (3) a $.03 per share ($4 million) benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense due to reserve adjustments and refunds from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and (4) a gain of $18 million ($11 million after tax), or $.06 per share benefit, related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2012 were $4.292 billion compared to $3.940 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $48 million for the full year 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report new records of performance in the fourth quarter of 2012 with sales of $1.146 billion and EPS before one-time items of $.94.  Sales increased by approximately 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced growth in all markets with particular strength in the mobile devices, wireless infrastructure, commercial aerospace and broadband markets.  Our strong growth is once again confirmation of the significant benefits of the Company's diversification, as well as our management team's ability to react quickly in a dynamic environment, especially given the still high levels of uncertainty in most of the world's economies.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability resulting in another strong operating margin performance of 19.5%, (excluding one-time items) up 100 basis points from the prior year quarter.  Operating cash flow in the quarter was $207 million, an excellent performance and confirmation of the quality of the Company's earnings.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"We close 2012 having achieved revenues for the year in excess of $4 billion, a major milestone in the progress of Amphenol. Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in the fourth quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of the interconnect assembly business of Tel-Ad Electronics Ltd., a leading Israeli supplier of value-added interconnect products for the communications, industrial and medical markets with annual sales of approximately $60 million.  The acquisition significantly enhances the Company's presence in this strategic technology development location, and expands our value-add capabilities in these significant end markets.  In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of other ways to increase shareholder value.  These include the purchase in this quarter of 2.5 million shares of the Company's stock completing the buyback authorized under the Company's January 2011 20 million share stock repurchase plan.  As such, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new two year open market stock repurchase plan for up to 10 million shares of the Company's common stock effective January 21, 2013."
 
"The overall economic environment continues to be characterized by a high level of market uncertainty. Considering such environment and assuming current currency exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2013 revenues in the range of $1.055 billion to $1.080 billion and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $.84 to $.87.  For the full year 2013, we expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $4.555 billion to $4.655 billion and $3.72  to $3.84, respectively, an increase in revenues of 6% to 8% and in diluted EPS (excluding one-time items), of 7% to 11% over 2012.  Despite the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics marketplace due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"As we head into 2013, it is clear that the electronics revolution is continuing, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, as we continue to focus on enabling the electronics revolution across the many diverse end markets we serve. Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to a constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Date: April 3, 2013

EXHIBIT 14.1
 
 
Amphenol consists of companies located around the globe with one common goal  to be the best that we can be.  Amphenol's reputation is one of our most important assets. This reputation has been, in large measure, earned through the honesty and integrity of our employees, officers and directors.
 
At some point, all of us will find ourselves facing a decision that involves an ethical issue. While common sense and good judgment most often provide the direction needed to "do the right thing", there may be situations where the right answer is not readily apparent.
 
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our "Code") provides the employees, officers and directors of Amphenol with an approach to dealing with ethical situations, information on available resources, and policy guidance on some common ethical issues. It will help you understand the Company's policy and the importance of ethical conduct for our continuing success. Everything that Amphenol is  a successful company dedicated to its customers, a leader in the community, a company of people who respect people  depends on a high standard of ethical conduct from each of us.
 
Our Code provides guidelines, policies and resources, but can never cover all situations which may arise. If you have a question or are not sure about what to do in a particular situation, please contact your superiors or the Amphenol Legal Department. Please be assured that all inquiries will be kept as confidential as is possible.
 
1. COMPLYING WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS
 
Employees, officers and directors of Amphenol should respect and comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the business in which they are involved. Some specific areas of the law are set forth below. You should understand that these areas are not the only areas with which you should be concerned  all areas of the law are covered by our Code.
 
a.
             
Insider Trading
 
Insider trading is both illegal and unethical. Federal and state securities laws prohibit the buying or selling of securities on the basis of material, non-public information. Regardless of level, those persons who are aware of material non-public information related to Amphenol or any other business, may not, directly or indirectly, use such material non-public information in purchasing or selling any securities of Amphenol or any other company. Persons who are prohibited from purchasing or selling the securities because they possess material, non-public information, may not have any other person purchase or sell securities on their behalf. Any purchases or sales made by another person on their behalf will be attributable to them. Material non-public information may not be disclosed to any person outside Amphenol (including relatives, friends or business associates) regardless of the purpose for which such disclosure may be made until authorized Company officials have adequately disclosed the information to the public. If you have any questions regarding the improper use or disclosure of material information, please contact the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
b.
             
Anti-Trust
 
Amphenol works hard to win business and provide outstanding service. However, we do not allow any action by any employee of the Company or any agreement or understanding that in any way illegally "restrains trade" i.e., which limits free competition. This includes any understanding or agreement with any of our competitors to fix or control prices, terms of sale, costs, profits, etc. There are potential fines and jail sentences for people who violate these laws. If you have any questions as to whether any action or proposed action violates or will violate any trade regulations or in any way restricts fair competition, please contact the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
c.
              
Anti-Bribery
 
Amphenol follows the laws and business practices where we operate whether in the United States or any other country throughout the world. This means that the standards and guidelines set forth in this Code apply equally to all of our companies and employees regardless of where business is being conducted.
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act with similar laws in other jurisdictions where the Company conducts its business, including without limitation the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, prohibit all Amphenol companies and operations, from making any payments or offers of payments to anyone in a foreign government or foreign political party in order to obtain or to retain business and payment of commercial bribes. These laws also prohibit Amphenol from making payments (including commissions) to third parties who in turn pay officials in any foreign government or political party in order to obtain or to retain business. Violations of these laws can lead to potential fines and jail sentences. If you have any questions regarding any anti-bribery laws, please contact the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
d.
             
Environmental, Health and Safety
 
We are committed to protecting the environment in which we live. We recognize our collective responsibilities to work to keep the environment clean and safe for future generations. Accordingly, Amphenol follows the environmental laws and regulations of the countries and communities where we operate. We also want to ensure a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. Amphenol employees must follow applicable safety and health laws and regulations of the countries and communities where we operate and related rules, regulations and procedures issued by the Company. If any employee feels that there is some operation which may not be safe or which is not adhering to local laws and regulations or related Company requirements or which does not meet any of the codes of the countries in which we operate, you must promptly notify your superiors or the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
 
2.
             
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 
Amphenol is committed to implementing programs and practices that promote environmental sustainability and social responsibility, while continually improving product quality and reliability.  These activities shall continue to be integrated into Amphenol's business activities, engineering systems and processes.  Accordingly, Amphenol will continue to maintain programs and practices that are intended to:
 
                 
Ensure the development of balanced regulatory and voluntary instruments that protect the environment while supporting innovation and Company growth
 
                 
Ensure Amphenol's products, operations and services comply with applicable laws and regulations, as a minimum standard
 
                 
Implement measures to integrate the Company's Health, Safety and Environment Policy and its Ethical Conduct Policy into business and decision-making processes
 
                 
Assign internal roles and responsibilities for sustainability and social responsibility programs and provide appropriate staff training
 
                 
Communicate as necessary and appropriate the Company's sustainability and social responsibility efforts to stakeholders
 
                 
Regularly assess performance and assure continued improvement
 
3.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
 
Employees, officers and directors of the Company should be scrupulous in avoiding a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with regard to the Company's interests. A "conflict of interest" exists whenever an individual's private interests interfere or conflict in any way (or even appear to interfere or conflict) with the interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when an employee, officer or director takes actions or has interests that make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and effectively.
 
Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or director, or when a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company, whether received from the Company or a third party.
 
Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policyunless the conflict situation has been approved by the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors as appropriate.  Any transaction, in which the Company as one party, and an employee, officer or director or an immediate family member, as a second party, has a direct or indirect material interest, requires review and approval by the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Board.  Any such proposed transaction must be reported to the General Counsel of the Company who will report the matter and his findings as necessary and appropriate to the President and Chief Executive Officer and/or to the full Board or to non-management members of the Board of Directors, as appropriate.  Any director with an interest in the transaction to be reviewed by the Board will be required to recuse himself from the review and approval process.  Following any such review, the Board of Directors would determine whether such transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, taking into consideration whether the terms of the proposed related party transaction are no less favorable to the Company than those available with unrelated third parties.
,
 
Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut.  If you have a question, you should consult with your manager or the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
4.  CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY
 
Employees, officers and directors are prohibited from (a) taking for themselves personally, or for a friend or a family member opportunities that properly belong to the Company, e.g., opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company property, information or position; (b) using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and (c) competing with the Company. Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.
 
5.  CONFIDENTIALITY
 
Employees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of nonpublic information entrusted to them by the Company or its suppliers or customers of the Company, except when disclosure is authorized by the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Amphenol Legal Department or as required by law.  Whenever feasible, employees, officers and directors should consult with the Amphenol Legal Department if they believe they have a legal obligation to disclose Company confidential information or confidential information acquired from a supplier or customer of the Company.
 
The Company has a great deal of confidential information. "Confidential Information" includes all non-public information (including information held in electronic as well as in traditional written form) that might be of use to competitors of the Company, or might be harmful to the Company, its suppliers or its customers if disclosed. This includes new product designs, technical information on our products or our development of new products or manufacturing processes as well as internal financial or costing data, data on suppliers, customers or employees and information relating to contemplated Company transactions. This information must be kept confidential. It may not be transferred outside the Company either by mail or electronically or physically taken out of the Company without the approval of an appropriate senior management employee, a Company officer or the Amphenol Legal Department.
 
Confidential information may not be given to anyone outside of the Company or to another employee who clearly does not have a "need to know" such information to do their job. Confidential information is very important and must be protected.
 
6.  FAIR DEALING
 
We seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. We seek competitive advantages through superior performance, never through unethical or illegal business practices. Stealing proprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner's consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited.
 
Each employee, officer and director should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers, competitors, officers and employees. No one should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair dealing practice.
 
7.  PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS
 
Employees, officers and directors should protect the Company's assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company's profitability. Company assets should only be used for legitimate business purposes.  The use of Company funds or assets for any unlawful, improper or unethical purpose is strictly prohibited.  This includes (i) bribes, kickbacks or other "influence" payments to any party, including government officials, customers, vendors, union representatives or others, (ii) excessive payments for goods and/or services and (iii) payments for goods and/or services to related parties which have not been approved by the President and Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors.
 
Amphenol has a policy to maintain accurate records fairly reflecting the Company's transfer and disposal of assets. No undisclosed or unrecorded funds or assets of the Company are to be established for any purpose.Employees must make sure that all Company assets are protected and properly recorded and, if used outside the Company, returned in a timely fashion.
 
 
Employees, officers and directors are prohibited from receiving payments or gifts of significance from government officials, customers, vendors or any other non-Company source related to Company business.
 
8.  FINANCIAL CONTROLS
 
Employees must make sure that payments made on behalf of the Company are approved in accordance with applicable Company policy and procedures and made with the appropriate and accurate supporting documentation. Employees, officers and directors must ensure that business expense reimbursements by the Company, in terms of Company paid meals, travel, entertainment or other business expenses, are correctly and accurately reported and approved in accordance with applicable Company policies and procedures.
 
9. EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
 
It is the Company's intention to comply with all local Fair Labor Standards, Protective Labor requirements, Safety and Health Standards, including but not limited to child labor, work hours, minimum wage, overtime, statutory benefits, and collective bargaining.
 
Amphenol is an equal opportunity employer in terms of hiring, promotions and, should it be necessary, termination.
 
Amphenol does not tolerate any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexual, sexual orientation, or gender identity, nor does it tolerate inappropriate remarks or abusive actions by any of its employees, officers or directors.
 
Amphenol does not tolerate illegal drug use.  Amphenol does not allow the use, sale, transfer or possession of any illegal orcontrolled substance by any person while on Company property or Company business.
 
Amphenol welcomes questions about the Company, our policies and procedures, our strategies and goals, and the results that are generated by the Company. Amphenol encourages employees, officers and directors to make suggestions for improving the Company.
 
10. FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING COMPLAINTS
 
As a public company, it is of critical importance that the Company's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission be accurate and timely.
 
Depending upon their position with the Company, employees, officers or directors may be called upon to provide necessary information to assure that the Company's public reports are complete, fair and understandable. The Company expects employees, officers and directors to take this responsibility very seriously and to provide prompt and accurate answers to inquiries related to the Company's public disclosure requirements.
 
The Company's policy and practice is to comply with applicable financial reporting and accounting regulations applicable to the Company. If any employee, officer or director of the Company has any concerns or complaints regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters of the Company, then he or she is encouraged to promptly submit those concerns or complaints (anonymously, confidentially or otherwise) to his or her superiors, to the Amphenol Legal Department, or to the hotline phone number posted on employee bulletin boards throughout the Company. Submissions to the hotline phone number may be made anonymously.
 
False or artificial entries, including transactions supported by false documentation with the intent to disguise the recipient, origin or purpose of the transaction are not to be made in the books and records of the Company for any reason.
 
11.  REPORTING ANY ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR
 
Employees are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate Company personnel, including the Amphenol Legal Department, about observed or suspected illegal or unethical behavior and, when in doubt, about the best course of action in a particular situation. Employees, officers and directors who are concerned that violations of this Code or that other illegal or unethical conduct by employees, officers or directors of the Company has occurred or may occur, should contact either their supervisors or superiors. If an employee does not believe it appropriate or are not comfortable approaching his or her supervisors or superiors about his or her concerns or complaints, then he or she may contact either the Amphenol Legal Department or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors or call the hotline phone number posted on employee bulletin boards throughout the Company. If his or her concerns or complaints require confidentiality, including keeping his or her identity anonymous, then this confidentiality will be protected, subject to applicable laws, regulations or legal proceedings.
 
12. CONFLICT MINERALS
 
The ores from which gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten are derived, that come from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining nearby countries (including Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, The Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia), which support the on-going conflicts in that region, are referred to herein as Conflict Minerals. It is believed that the proceeds of mining Conflict Minerals may contribute to armed conflict and human rights abuses.  In support of initiatives to cut financing for this armed conflict and human rights abuses and in compliance with the regulations applicable to publicly traded companies, Amphenol has implemented programs and practices that are intended to:
 
                 
Confirm with reasonable certainty that the gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten purchased from suppliers and used in its products are not derived from Conflict Minerals
 
                 
Maintain, as necessary and appropriate, records of supplier verifications for both internal and/or external audit
 
                 
Assign internal roles and responsibilities and provide appropriate staff training to manage these programs and practices
 
                 
Communicate the Company's efforts, as necessary and appropriate, to stakeholders
 
13.  NO RETALIATION
 
Amphenol will not permit retaliation of any kind against good faith reports or complaints of violations of this Code or other illegal or unethical conduct.
 
14.  AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER
 
This Code may be amended, modified or waived by the Board of Directors and waivers may also be granted by a designated committee of the Board, subject to the disclosure and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules thereunder and the applicable rules and standards of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
15.  FAILURE TO FOLLOW CODE PROVISIONS
 
Failure of an employee, officer or director to follow the provisions of this Code may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge in addition to any civil or criminal liability that might result from the offender's actions. The Amphenol Human Resources Department will be notified of and participate in any investigations undertaken in connection with such an action.
 
Please note that this Code does not specifically cover all types of conduct nor does it answer all of the questions you may have. If there is any doubt whether you should do something, it is best to think of the following question: "If I took the action and it became public, would Amphenol or I be embarrassed by it or subject to any disciplinary action?" If the answer is yes, don't do it! If you are not sure, seek advice from your superiors or the Amphenol Legal Department or call the Amphenol hotline phone number posted on employee bulletin boards throughout the Company.

Wallingford, Connecticut. April 18, 2013.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share, before one-time items, of $.87 compared to $.77 per share for the comparable 2012 period.  On an as-reported basis diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2013 was $.94 and included an income tax benefit of $11 million or $.07 per share resulting from the delay, by the U. S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income.  Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012.  Under U.S. GAAP, the related benefit to the Company of $11 million or $.07 per share relating to the 2012 tax year was recorded as a one-time benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement. Sales for the first quarter 2013 were $1.080 billion compared to $982 million for the 2012 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $2 million in the first quarter 2013 compared to the 2012 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report strong first quarter results with sales up 10% and EPS (excluding one-time items) up 13% over the comparable 2012 quarter.  The sales growth was driven by increases in nearly all of our served markets led by mobile devices, commercial aerospace, broadband communications and industrial, with contributions from both organic growth and our acquisition program.  This strong growth is further confirmation of the significant benefits of the Company's technology leadership and diversification. We are especially encouraged to have achieved strong orders of $1.120 billion in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability, resulting in an operating margin improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter to 19.2%.  These results are a direct result of our management team's ability to react quickly in a dynamic environment, especially given the continuing high levels of uncertainty in most of the world's economies.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  The Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value including, in this quarter, the purchase of 1.2 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan."
 
"Considering the still uncertain global economic environment and assuming current currency exchange rates, we expect second quarter 2013 revenues in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.140 billion and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $.92 to $.95.  For the year 2013, we now expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $4.580 billion to $4.655 billion and $3.76 to $3.85, respectively, an increase of 7% to 8% over 2012 revenues and 8% to 11% over 2012 diluted EPS (excluding one-time items). This compares to prior full year 2013 guidance for revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.555 billion to $4.655 billion and $3.72 to $3.84, respectively.  Despite the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics marketplace due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.  Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."

Note 1
           
Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2013 included an income tax benefit of $11.3 million, or $.07 per share, resulting from the delay, by the U. S. government, in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income.  Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012.  Under U.S. GAAP, the related benefit to the Company of $11.3 million, or $.07 per share, relating to the 2012 tax year was recorded as a one-time benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement. Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.87 for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
