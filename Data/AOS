A. O. SMITH CORPORATON NEWS RELEASE For further information contact: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIA INQUIRES: ANALYST/INVESTOR INQUIRES: A.O. Smith Corporation Edward J. O'Connor Craig Watson P.O. Box 245008 414-359-4100 414-359-4009 Milwaukee, WI 53224-9508 414-359-4000 NYSE: AOS Milwaukee, Wis.--First quarter 2003 net earnings for A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) increased 13 percent to $13.7 million compared with the $12.1 million earned during the same period in 2002. While net earnings improved 13 percent, the $.46 per share earnings in the first quarter fell below last year's $.50 per share. This difference is due to the impact of the 4.8 million shares issued in the May 2002 stock offering. Both earnings and earnings per share were at the high end of the company's forecast. Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 increased four percent to $387.9 million compared with 2002 first quarter revenues of $371.9 million. "Earnings were positively influenced by improved operating performance in our Electrical Products business as well as lower interest expense," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, pointed out. Electrical Products Electrical Products reported first quarter sales of $213.1 million, nearly nine percent higher than first quarter sales in 2002. The sales increase was the result of the July 2002 acquisition of Athens Products, higher sales in the pump and after-market businesses, as well as additional sales from the company's recently acquired Chinese motor operations. Sales to the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) market were flat. -more-
a. o. smith first quarter earnings add l The higher volumes and improved operating expenses contributed to first quarter operating profit of $17.7 million, a 16 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2002. Electrical Products' cost reduction and product repositioning initiatives continue, and during the quarter, the company closed its Monticello, Ind., assembly facility. Production from that plant was transferred to company operations in Mexico. Water Systems Water Systems' first quarter sales of $174.8 million were essentially flat compared with the same period in 2002. A price increase to offset higher steel costs took effect in the last half of the quarter. This net cost increase coupled with lower unit sales, caused first quarter operating profit to decline to $12.0 million from the $13.6 million earned last year. On July 1, new regulatory standards go into effect that impact gas-fired residential water heaters, and Water Systems remains on schedule with plans to introduce new products that comply with these standards. The new regulations mandate that gas residential water heaters resist accidentally igniting flammable vapors that may be caused by spilled gasoline or other flammable materials ill-advisedly taken into the home. The standards will be phased in over a two-year period, beginning with 30, 40, and 50-gallon products this year. Company discusses outlook "Our customers remain very cautious due to weakening consumer demand and the general uncertainty in the U.S. economy," O'Toole commented. "In spite of these concerns, we remain comfortable with our 2003 forecast of earnings in the range of $2.05 and $2.25 per share." "As we have stated before, lower pension income and cost increases in areas such as medical benefits, liability insurance, and steel will impact us during the full year, while the benefits of repositioning at Electrical Products, the integration of State Industries, and the introduction of new water heater products are weighted to the last half of the year. -more-
a. o. smith first quarter earnings add 2 Consequently, we expect year-over-year comparisons to improve in the last half of the year. For the second quarter of 2003, we estimate net income will be modestly better than last year, with earnings per share in a range of $.64 to $.68 per share." A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call beginning at 1:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Smith Corporation Edward J. O' Connor Craig Watson P.O. Box 245008 414-359-4100 414-359-4009 Milwaukee, WI 53224-9508 414-359-4000 NYSE: AOS A. O. Smith reports second quarter results of $.67 per share and reaffirms 2003 outlook Milwaukee, Wis.--Electric motor and water heater manufacturer A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today reported second quarter earnings of $.67 per share with net earnings of $19.8 million marking a 10 percent improvement compared with the second quarter of last year. Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were $417.6 million, approximately eight percent higher than sales for the same period in 2002. The company forecasts third quarter earnings of $.42 to $.46 per share with a full-year projection of $2.10 to $2.25 per share. "Despite softness in key markets, we achieved improved sales due to acquisitions and higher residential gas water heater volume. Ongoing weakness in commercial construction markets negatively influenced sales of both commercial water heaters and hermetic motors for commercial air conditioners," according to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. O'Toole. "Notwithstanding the higher sales in the second quarter, business segment income was slightly lower than the second quarter of 2002 because of the low-margin sales of recent acquisitions in our motor business and unfavorable sales mix in the water heater operation. Net earnings, however, improved due to an insurance settlement, a lower tax rate, and lower interest expense." 3
For the first six months of 2003, A. O. Smith Corporation reported net earnings of $33.5 million or $1.13 per share compared with earnings of $30.1 million or $1.17 per share. The May 2002 stock issuance of 4.8 million shares had a $.13 per share dilutive -more- aosmith earnings add l impact on 2003 when compared to 2002. Six-month sales of $805.5 million were approximately six percent higher than 2002 first-half sales of $758.2 million. Electrical Products Electrical Products' second quarter sales were $227.6 million, approximately $8 million higher than the 2002 second quarter, due to additional sales from the acquisition of Athens Products and the company's Chinese motor acquisitions. Reflecting the cooler-than-normal weather conditions in the northern United States, sales of heating and air conditioning motors were five percent lower than last year's second quarter, excluding the Athens Products acquisition. Sales of pump motors were also approximately five percent lower as a result of the cooler-than-normal weather. Operating earnings of $18.6 million were 10 percent lower than the 2002 second quarter as a result of the lower sales in the base business more than offsetting the contributions from the acquisitions. During the second quarter the business closed its Athens, Tenn., plant and announced that its Ripley, Tenn., facility will cease production this month. Water Systems Second quarter sales were $190.0 million, nearly 14 percent higher than second quarter 2002 sales of $167.1 million due to a price increase implemented to offset higher steel prices, as well as higher volumes of residential gas water heaters. As a result of the weak commercial construction market, sales of commercial product declined less than five percent in the second quarter compared with last year. Operating earnings for the same period were $17.8 million, seven percent higher than the 2002 second quarter. While operating earnings improved, operating margins were adversely impacted by the unfavorable commercial and residential product mix. On July 1, Water Systems introduced its new line of residential gas-fired water heaters, including redesigned products that comply with new ANSI regulations that govern flammable vapor ignition resistance. As part of the ongoing integration of the State Industries acquisition, the company -more- aosmith earnings add 2 4
recently announced plans to consolidate the North American manufacture of residential water heaters at its Ashland City, Tenn., and Juarez, Mexico, facilities. The initiative, which will involve transferring residential production from the McBee, S. C. plant, will be complete by the first quarter of 2004. The company also announced it will close its El Paso, Texas, boiler plant and relocate this production to McBee. That transfer is scheduled to be complete by the end of this year's third quarter. Outlook "The company's overall cost structure has improved significantly over the last year and a half, and our operating units will continue to aggressively manage cost as we go forward," O'Toole said. "We project per share earnings of $.42 to $.46 in the third quarter. We also are reaffirming and narrowing our guidance for full-year 2003 earnings to a range of between $2.10 and $2.25 per share." "While we don't anticipate any rebound in our served markets in 2003, the impact of operating improvements and new products will materialize and accelerate during the second half of the year. These improvements include the continued success of the motor repositioning programs and the ongoing integration of the State Industries acquisition. In addition to these operating improvements, the introduction of new water heater products during the second half of the year will generate additional sales and earnings. As a consequence, we expect earnings per share comparisons to improve significantly in the third and fourth quarters of this year," O'Toole continued. A. O.

Smith Corporation Logo - ------------------------------------------------ - ------------------------------------------------ A. O. Smith Second Quarter 2003 Conference Call - ------------------------------------------------ Introduction (Craig Watson, Investor Relations Director) Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call. With me this morning participating in the call are Bob O'Toole, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Krueger, Chief Financial Officer; and John Kita; Treasurer and Controller. Before we begin with Bob's remarks I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, could constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. I'd also like to point out that we have posted slides on our website so feel free to follow along while we conduct the call. Bob will now make a few opening comments and Ken will discuss results in more detail. Bob ... Thank you Craig. Slide 2 Second Quarter Financial Results (in millions, except per share) 2003 2002 change ---- ---- ------ Sales $417.6 $386.3 $31.3 Net Earnings 19.8 18.0 1.8 EPS $0.67 $0.66 $0.01 ====== ====== ====== 11
Financial Overview (Robert O'Toole, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer) Second quarter earnings were $19.8 million, representing a ten percent improvement compared with the $18 million earned in last year's second quarter. Earnings were sixty seven cents per share, and compared with prior year earnings of sixty six cents per share. EPS only increased one cent as a result of the dilutive effect of the secondary stock offering in May of 2002. Second quarter sales were $418 million compared with $386 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase in sales was due to the July 2002 acquisition of Athens Products, sales from the recently acquired Chinese motor operation and higher volume at Water Products. We had an unusually large number of dynamics affecting second quarter financial performance. As I just said, sales were up about $32 million for the quarter. Sales increases were due to the July 2002 acquisition of Athens Products, our recently acquired Chinese motor operations, and accelerated buying of residential gas water heaters ahead of the July 1 launch of the flammable vapor resistant product. These sales increases more than offset weakness in the commercial construction market for both commercial water heaters and air conditioners as well as softness in residential air conditioning markets. The resulting mix of these sales negatively impacted operating margins. The decline in operating margins, however, was overcome by one-time positive items, including an insurance settlement and favorable resolution of an R&D credit for tax purposes. All of these dynamics resulted in improved performance relative to last year. On the operating front, our repositioning activities continue in 2003 as we move product out of higher cost facilities in the U.S. into Mexico and manufacture an increasing numbers of motors in our new facilities in China. Earlier this month we began manufacturing the Flammable Vapor Resistant gas water heater in 30, 40 & 50 gallon sizes. In addition to incremental sales and margin, the introduction of these new products will allow us to accelerate the standardization of the combined water heater product line which is expected to generate significant cost savings as we streamline manufacturing and ship product from plants that are better aligned with our customers' location. Last week we announced the rationalization of our major U.S. residential and commercial water heating operations in our Ashland City, Tennessee and McBee, South Carolina facilities, respectively and Ken will elaborate on those actions shortly. 12
Slide 3 2003 Earnings Forecast ---------------------- Q3 03 $.42 - $.46 2003 $2.10 - $2.25 The company's overall cost structure has improved significantly over the last eighteen months and our operating units will continue to aggressively improve cost in both the third and fourth quarters. This morning we announced a projection of .42 to .46 per share for the third quarter, reaffirmed our 2003 outlook and narrowed our guidance for full year 2003 earnings of between $2.10 and $2.25 per share. As we have previously stated, operating improvements will materialize and accelerate during the second half of the year. These improvements include the continued success of the motor repositioning programs and the ongoing integration of the State Industries acquisition. In addition to these operating improvements, the introduction of new water heater products during the second half of the year is projected to generate additional sales and earnings. As a consequence, earnings per share comparisons are expected to improve significantly in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Ken will now take you through a more detailed discussion of the quarter, and the outlook for the balance of 2003. Ken... Thanks, Bob....... Slide 4 Second Quarter Financial Results (in millions, except per share earnings) ---------------------------------------- 2003 2002 change ---- ---- ------ Sales $418 $386 $ 32 Acquisitions (19) - (19) ------ ------ ------ Core Sales 399 386 13 Net Earnings 19.8 18.0 1.8 EPS $ 0.67 $ 0.66 $ 0.01 ====== ====== ====== Shares 29.7 27.2 2.5 Second quarter financials (Ken Krueger (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) 13
During the second quarter, sales were $418 million, up 8% from the second quarter of 2002. As Bob said, sales increases came from acquisitions in the motors business, and residential gas water heater sales, which more than offset declines in sales of commercial water heaters and air conditioners, as well as residential electric water heaters. Net earnings for the quarter increased to $19.8 million, compared to $18 million last year. Business segment earnings were down $700 thousand due to the mix of product sales. This shortfall was more than offset by an insurance recovery from a bankrupt carrier and the favorable resolution of an R&D tax credit. Earnings per share improved modestly to sixty seven cents from sixty six cents last year, as improved earnings more than overcame the five cent dilutive impact of the May, 2002 stock offering. On a year-to-date basis, earnings are $1.13 per share compared to last year's $1.17 per share. The stock offering had a thirteen cent dilutive impact on this six month comparison. Slide 5 2003 June 30 YTD Cash Flow Cash Flow from Operations ($ in millions) --------------- 1999 $23 2000 $30 2001 $17 2002 $50 2003 $(6) Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Operating cash flow for the first six months of the year was an outflow of $6.1 million dollars. Operating cash flow is typically weighted to the second half of the year. This is due to the seasonality of motor sales to the HVAC and pump markets in the first half of the year, which tends to build up receivables at June 30. In addition to this seasonality, two other items caused increases in receivables and inventory this year. Electrical Products repositioning to Mexico and China required increased inventory levels to minimize customer service disruption through the transition. The launch of flammable vapor resistant water heaters on July 1 caused pressure on both receivables and inventories at Water Systems. For the full year, we are projecting operating cash flow of $80 to $90 million, as working capital returns to normalized levels, coupled with specific efforts to reduce inventory at Electrical Products. One encouraging area was accounts payable, which improved $31.3 million from year-end. 14
Capital spending totaled $15 million compared with depreciation and amortization of $26 million. For the full year, we are projecting capital spending of approximately $45 million and depreciation of $50 million. Slide 6 Debt-to-Capital --------------- 12/31/02 33% 6/30/03 34% Debt to Capital As a result of the negative cash flow year-to-date, our debt to capital ratio of 34% is slightly higher than the 33% recorded at year-end. During the second quarter, we took advantage of the favorable interest rate market and secured approximately $50 million in new long term debt at a fixed rate of just under four and a half percent. Now I'd like to move on to a discussion of the operating performance in our Electrical Products and Water Systems businesses. Slide 7 Electrical Products (in millions) ------------- Q2 03 Q2 02 change % ----- ----- ------ --- Sales 208.6 219.2 (10.6) -5% Athens 12.7 - 12.7 China 6.3 6.3 ----- ----- ------ --- Total 227.6 219.2 8.4 4% EBIT 18.6 20.5 (1.9) -9% EBIT Margin 8.2% 9.4% Electrical Products Sales in our Electrical Products business increased $8 million to $228 million in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the Athens Product and Chinese motor acquisitions. Excluding these acquisition-related sales of approximately $19 million, sales were modestly lower as a result of continued weakness in commercial markets and weather-related softness in both HVAC and leisure pump markets. HVAC sales declined approximately five percent. Electrical Products reported a nine percent decline in operating income to $18.6 million compared with $20.5 million last year. Second quarter EBIT margin was 8.2% of sales. The decline in operating margin was due primarily to the acquisitions, whose sales do not yet contribute to profitability. 15
Slide 8 EPC Repositioning ----------------- o Six facilities or lines of production o More than $25 million in annual savings o Substantially repositioned - Monticello - closed Q1 03 - Athens - closed Q2 03 - Ripley - will close this month o China - Shenzhen - 25,000 motors per day; pump motors next - Changzhou Update on EPC Restructuring EPC repositioning activities continue. During the first quarter of 2003 we closed our Monticello operation and during the second quarter we completed the transfer of production from our Athens facility. We also announced that our Ripley operation will close this month. In combination with a ten percent reduction in salaried workforce in 2002 and the consolidation of logistics operations, these actions generated $19 million in savings in 2002 and are expected to generate more than $25 million in 2003 and beyond. China While we suffered a brief delay due to the SARS situation transition of motor manufacturing to China continues. Our Shenzhen facility is producing a significant volume of C-Frame motors. We are in the final stages of customer approval for pump and fan motors at both Shenzhen and our motor operations in Changzhou. We are also continuing our evaluation and expect to expand our Chinese manufacturing capabilities to include hermetic motors. 16
Slide 9 AC Market As I mentioned, HVAC sales, excluding the sales of the Athens Product acquisition, declined in the quarter, consistent with industry trends. Total air conditioning inventory of 1.7 million units at the end of May was eight percent higher than last year. Year-to-date, distributor sales are down ten percent while OEM sales have declined four. Slide 10 Water Systems (in millions) ------------- Q2 03 Q2 02 change % ----- ----- ------ --- Sales 190.0 167.1 22.9 14% EBIT 17.8 16.6 1.2 7% EBIT Margin 9.4% 9.9% Water Systems Water Systems second quarter sales of $190 million were twenty three million higher than in the second quarter of last year. The higher sales were driven by the price increase introduced earlier in the year to offset higher steel costs, expanded sales of residential gas water heaters in anticipation of the new flammable vapor resistant product, and a more than 40 percent increase in sales at our Chinese operation. Commercial sales declined less than five percent reflecting the soft commercial construction market. Operating profit of $17.8 million was seven percent higher than last year. The slower growth in operating income compared to sales is the result of higher steel costs and the adverse product mix. 17
Slide 11 Water Systems Flammable Vapor Resistant Product --------------------------------- o July 1 manufacturing mandate - all 30, 40 and 50 gallon gas water heaters; manufacturing began July 1 o Sales expectations - existing product - until channel is clear - Second quarter pre-buy Flammable Vapor Manufacturing of the flammable vapor resistant product has begun for all gas units in the 30, 40 and 50-gallon capacities, as mandated by American National and Canadian Standards associations (ANSI & CSA). Any inventory of existing pre-regulation product, regardless of its location in the channel, will continue to be saleable until all inventories are liquidated. In the second quarter, customers purchased approximately one month of extra volume of 30, 40 and 50 gallon gas water heaters. Unit volume of electric product was depressed during the quarter and so replenishment of that product should mitigate the expected softness in the residential gas market during the first half of the third quarter. Sales of the flammable vapor product should positively impact both sales and margin later in the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter. Slide 12 Water Systems Standardization with Customization o Leverage flammable vapor product introduction to standardize the basic product o New design allows for customization and enhanced customer service o Facility rationalization o Ashland City - residential product o McBee - commercial product Product Standardization In connection with the introduction of the new flammable vapor resistant product, we have launched a program to "standardize and customize" the Water Systems product line. This program will benefit our business in two ways: first, standardizing the basic 18
design will allow us to build product in plants closest to their end market, maximizing logistics and shipping efficiencies. Secondly, these products, while having a standard "chassis", will allow for customized configuration further along in the assembly process. This "standardize and customize" program allows us to streamline our manufacturing operation while enhancing customer service, and maintains the most up to date products for all brands. The company recently announced plans to consolidate the North American manufacture of residential water heaters at its Ashland City, Tenn., and Juarez, Mexico, facilities. The initiative, which will involve transferring residential production from the McBee, S. C. plant, will be complete by the first quarter of 2004. At the same time, we are consolidating most of our commercial manufacturing in our McBee facility, which involves the transfer of production from Ashland City, Tennessee and the El Paso, Texas, boiler plant. Slide 13 2003 Earnings Forecast ---------------------- 2003 est. 2002 --------- ---- Third Quarter $.42 - .46 $ 0.34 Full Year $2.10 - 2.25 $ 1.86 2003 Outlook As Bob mentioned at the beginning of this call, our cost structure has improved significantly over the last eighteen months and this morning we projected third quarter earnings of .42 cents to .46 cents and reaffirmed our full year 2003 earnings estimate of between $2.10 and $2.25 per share. Significant operating improvements will begin to materialize in the third quarter and accelerate in the fourth quarter. These improvements include completing the motor repositioning program with the closure of the Athens and Ripley plants, ramping up the Chinese operations, and the integration of the State Industries acquisition. In addition to these operating improvements, the introduction of new flammable vapor resistant water heaters beginning this quarter should generate additional sales and earnings during the second half. From this point forward, our comparable year-over-year share base will include last year's five million share stock offering and we will no longer need to overcome the dilutive effect of the additional shares. As a consequence of all these items, earnings per share comparisons are expected to improve significantly in the third quarter, with even further improvement in the fourth quarter. Slide 14 [A. O. SMITH CORPORATION LOGO] 19
Conclusion In conclusion, our cost saving and new product initiatives are on track and we are financially well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as they materialize. We look forward to reporting on our continued progress again next quarter. (Craig speaks) That completes our opening remarks and we are now ready for your questions. As a reminder please limit your inquiries to one or two questions at a time so that everyone interested has an opportunity to participate. Q&A (Bob speaks) We have made a solid start in 2003 but many of the revenue and margin improvement programs are still ahead of us. We look forward to updating you on our ongoing success in implementing these programs. 20

A. O. SMITH CORPORATON NEWS RELEASE For further information contact: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIA INQUIRES: ANALYST/INVESTOR INQUIRES: A. O. Smith Corporation Edward J. O' Connor Craig Watson P.O. Box 245008 414-359-4100 414-359-4009 Milwaukee, WI 53224-9508 414-359-4000 NYSE: AOS A. O. Smith lowers third quarter estimate to $.18 to $.20 per share, full year earnings to $1.75 - $1.80; forecasts 2004 earnings of $2.40 - $2.60 per share A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today lowered its estimate of third quarter earnings to $.18 to $.20 per share compared to its previous estimate of $.42 to $.46 per share for the quarter. Full-year earnings are now projected to range from $1.75 to $1.80 per share. Full-year earnings were previously estimated to range from $2.10 to $2.25 per share. For 2004, the company expects earnings of between $2.40 and $2.60 per share. In July, the company noted that declines in commercial construction activity and softness in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market would result in little sales growth during the year. It expected earnings improvement in the second half to be driven by production repositioning in its electric motor business and the launch of new flammable vapor resistant water heaters. In anticipation of the launch of the flammable vapor resistant product in the third quarter, customers purchased significant quantities of residential gas water heaters in the second quarter. The resulting sales reduction in the third quarter, coupled with the disruption in manufacturing schedules caused by the pre-buy activity and the launch of the new product, caused sales and profit levels to be lower than anticipated. It is expected that performance in the water heater business will be back on track in the fourth quarter. In the electric motors business, previously announced efforts to reposition U.S. production to lower cost Mexican facilities were largely completed, although later than planned. Manufacturing costs were somewhat higher than anticipated during the final -more-
a. o. smith estimates add l stages of this transition, negatively impacting third quarter profitability. In addition, inventory levels have grown in order to assure customer deliveries during the shift in production facilities. Inventories are also higher due to manufacturing schedules that anticipated higher sales levels. In order to reduce these inventory levels, production levels will be reduced through the fourth quarter. This will reduce fixed cost absorption and manufacturing margins during the fourth quarter. "While we are pleased in achieving a major milestone in our motors repositioning strategy, we are disappointed in our margin performance and inventory levels during the second half of this year. We are committed to addressing both issues and establishing a strong base for improved operating performance," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, said. O'Toole further commented, "The year 2003 has been one of challenge and accomplishment. In the motors business, we have transferred one-half of our domestic manufacturing operation to lower cost facilities in Mexico and China. In the water heater business, we have undergone the most significant product line transformation in our history. While these transformations will be largely behind us by year-end, we have suffered some delay in timing and higher costs than anticipated due to the disruption. We expect to be on track with our long-term strategic direction by year-end. Accordingly, we expect financial performance in 2004 to be in line with our strategic plan, in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share." A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

A. O. SMITH CORPORATON NEWS RELEASE For further information contact: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIA INQUIRES: ANALYST/INVESTOR INQUIRES: A.O. Smith Corporation Edward J. O' Connor Craig Watson P.O. Box 245008 414-359-4100 414-359-4009 Milwaukee, WI 53224-9508 414-359-4000 NYSE: AOS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 14, 2003 A. O. Smith announces third quarter earnings of $.20 per share Milwaukee, Wis.--A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced third quarter net earnings of $6.0 million or $.20 per share, in line with the estimate announced in September but lower than third quarter 2002 net earnings of $10.0 million or $.34 per share. Sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $356.4 million, $4 million higher than sales for the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2003, net earnings for the Milwaukee-based manufacturer of electric motors and water heaters were $39.6 million, compared with $40.1 million earned during the same period of 2002. Revenues for the nine-month period were $1.16 billion compared with 2002 nine-month revenues of $1.11 billion. As indicated in its Sept. 24 press release, the company incurred costs in the third quarter due to timing delays and disruptions, as both of its businesses undertook significant transitions. These transitions included the transfer of electric motor production to lower-cost facilities in Mexico and China, as well as the introduction of flammable vapor resistant water heaters. According to Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, "While we are disappointed in our financial performance in the third quarter, we are pleased in achieving major milestones in both businesses. We expect to begin receiving the benefits of these efforts in the fourth quarter and to be fully on track with our long-term strategic direction by year-end." -more-
A. O. Smith Earnings add 1 The company also announced that it has entered into a letter of intent to acquire the assets of Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd., near Shanghai. Taicang will serve to expand the company's China manufacturing capability to include hermetic motors. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Electrical Products Third quarter sales of $201.2 million were modestly higher than third-quarter 2002 sales of $197.5 million. Operating earnings of $9.6 million were $700,000 lower than the same period in 2002, due to expenses in relocating production to lower-cost facilities, which adversely impacted manufacturing costs and finished goods inventories. Water Systems Water Systems' sales of $155.2 million were flat compared with the third quarter of 2002. Higher sales in China, coupled with price increases related to steel costs and newly launched products, were offset by lower unit sales of residential and commercial water heaters. Operating profit of $7.9 million was approximately $5.5 million lower than the third quarter of 2002 as a result of one-time manufacturing and freight costs due to the flammable vapor resistant product launch. Outlook "As we indicated in our Sept. 24 press release, we expect earnings for 2003 to range between $1.75 and $1.80 per share. This reduction from our previous forecast was due to the disruptions in the third quarter and efforts to reduce electric motor inventory in the fourth quarter," O'Toole commented. "We expect these implementation difficulties to be behind us as we enter 2004. Accordingly, we expect earnings per share to be in line with our strategic plan, in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share." A. O.

A. O. Smith Corporation - Script Third Quarter 2003 Earnings Conference Call October 14, 2003 at 10:21 a.m. Eastern Time Slide 1 A. O. Smith Corporation Logo Third Quarter 2003 Conference Call Introduction - Craig Watson Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call. With me this morning participating in the call are Ken Krueger, Chief Financial Officer; and John Kita; Treasurer and Controller. Before we begin with Ken's remarks I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, could constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. I'd also like to point out that this conference call is accompanied by slides on our website so please feel free to follow along while we conduct the call. Ken ... Thank you Craig. Slide 2 Third Quarter Results (in millions, except per share) 2003 2002 change ------ ------ ------ Sales $356.4 $352.4 $4.0 Net Earnings 6.0 10.0 (4.0) EPS $0.20 $0.34 $(0.14) ====== ====== ======
Third Quarter Results - Ken Krueger Third quarter earnings were 20 cents per share or approximately $6.0 million, compared with 34 cents per share or $10 million earned in last year's third quarter. Third quarter sales were $356 million compared with $352 million last year. I will address comparisons to last year later under business unit performance. From a forecast perspective, on September 24th we announced an expected shortfall in pretax earnings of approximately $11 million, compared with our prior forecast of approximately $20 million. This shortfall was due to the costs related to timing delays and disruptions caused by significant transitions in both businesses. These transitions included the repositioning of electric motor manufacturing to Mexico and China, and the launch of flammable vapor resistant water heaters. Slide 3 Earnings Forecast Q4 03 $.42 - $.47 2003 $1.75 - $1.80 2004 $2.40 - $2.60 Earnings Forecast Due to the lower third quarter results, as well as fourth quarter inventory reduction initiatives in the motors business, we lowered the full year outlook for 2003 to a range of between $1.75 and $1.80 per share. We are disappointed in this earnings reduction, but expect to be back on track as we move forward. In the fourth quarter, we believe our water heater business will be generating double digit operating margins. And though our motors business will experience some fixed cost absorption issues in the fourth quarter, we expect to see significant cost advantages in 2004. As a result of the efforts to reposition manufacturing, we believe the motors business should generate incremental pretax earnings of at least fifteen million dollars in 2004. In Water Systems, the introduction of new regulation mandated product, as well as product standardization efforts and plant rationalization programs, are expected to generate in excess of twenty million pretax dollars. Accordingly, we are projecting 2004 earnings to range between $2.40 and $2.60 per share, compared with this year's estimate of $1.75 to $1.80. Now I would like to go through a more detailed review of the third quarter.
Slide 4 Third Quarter Results (in millions, except per share earnings) 2003 2002 change ------- ------- ------ Electrical Products $ 201.2 $ 197.5 $ 3.7 Water Systems 155.2 154.9 0.3 ------- ------- ------ Total Sales $ 356.4 $ 352.4 $ 4.0 Net Earnings 6.0 10.0 (4.0) EPS $ 0.20 $ .034 $(0.14) ======= ======== ====== Shares 29.8 29.5 0.3 Third quarter financials Third quarter pretax earnings were approximately $11 million lower than our forecast at the end of the second quarter. As you'll recall, in anticipation of the launch of the flammable vapor resistant product in the third quarter, customers purchased significant quantities of residential gas water heaters in the second quarter. The resulting sales reduction in the third quarter, coupled with the disruption in manufacturing schedules caused by the pre-buy activity and the launch of the new product, negatively impacted forecasted profits by approximately $6.5 million in the third quarter. We believe this disruption has run its course and expect performance in the water heater business to be back on track in the fourth quarter. In the electric motor business, profits fell about $4.5 million below forecast due to a combination of reasons. Sales volumes were below expectations, generating operating profit that was $3 million less than forecasted. Previously announced efforts to reposition U.S. production to lower cost Mexican facilities were largely completed, although somewhat later in the quarter than we had forecasted. As a result, savings from this transition came later than anticipated generating a profit shortfall of $1.5 million in the quarter. Manufacturing costs were higher than expected during the final stages of the transition, also negatively impacting third quarter profitability by approximately $2.5 million. As you may recall from last quarter, motor inventory levels have grown in order to assure customer deliveries during the shift in production. Inventories are also higher due to manufacturing schedules that anticipated higher sales levels. Motor inventory levels increased during the quarter, causing an improvement in fixed cost absorption of approximately $2.5 million. As we reduce production to rebalance inventory in the fourth quarter, we will under-absorb fixed costs. This under-absorption will adversely affect fourth quarter operating profit.
Slide 5 2003 Cash Flow Cash Flow from Operations ($ in millions) Q1 (11) Q2 5 Q3 32 Cash Flow Operating cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $26 million dollars. During the third quarter, the company generated $32 million in operating cash flow. Cash flow is typically weighted to the second half of the year due to the seasonality of motor sales to the HVAC and pump markets in the first half of the year, which tends to build up receivables at June 30. In addition to this seasonality, two other factors had pronounced impacts, causing increases in receivables and inventory. Electrical Products repositioning to Mexico and China required increased inventory levels to minimize customer service disruption through the transition. The launch of flammable vapor resistant water heaters on July 1 caused pressure on both receivables and inventories at Water Systems at the end of the second quarter. During the third quarter, receivables declined $47 million while inventories increased $16 million. For the full year, we are projecting operating cash flow of approximately $60 to $70 million, as working capital returns to normalized levels, coupled with specific efforts to reduce motor inventory. Year to date, capital spending is $28 million compared with depreciation of $39 million. For the full year, we are projecting capital spending of approximately $40 to $45 million and depreciation of about $50 million. Slide 6 Debt-to-Capital 12/31/02 33% 6/30/03 34% 9/30/03 33%
Debt to Capital As a result of the positive cash flow in the third quarter, our debt to capital ratio declined to 33% from 34% at the end of June. Now I'd like to move on to a discussion of the operating performance in our Electrical Products and Water Systems businesses compared to last year. Slide 7 Electrical Products (in millions) Q3 03 Q3 02 change % ----- ----- ------ ------- Sales 197.2 197.5 (0.3) 0% China 4.0 - 4.0 ----- ----- ------ Total 201.2 197.5 3.7 2% EBIT 9.6 10.3 (0.7) -7% EBIT Margin 4.8% 5.2% Electrical Products Sales of $201 million in our Electrical Products business were slightly higher compared with last year's third quarter. Sales from last year's China acquisition and increased sales of air conditioning motors and motors sold through the distribution channel, offset lower sales of motors for pump, subfractional and general industry applications. Operating profit at Electrical Products declined to $9.6 million from $10.3 million last year. Third quarter EBIT margin was 4.8% of sales. The decline in operating margin was due to the repositioning disruptions as well as last year's acquisitions, whose sales do not yet contribute to profitability.
Slide 8 EPC Plant & Production Repositionings o 3 plants closed in 2003 - Monticello - closed Q1 - Athens - closed Q2 - Ripley - closed Q3 o Significant production from 4 other plants o Shenzhen - capacity for 30,000 motors per day o Changzhou - production start-up in fourth quarter o Taicang hermetic motor manufacturing EPC Repositioning Though we are disappointed with the earnings shortfall related to the repositioning activities at Electrical Products, we also believe we have achieved significant results considering the number of simultaneous relocation activities. During 2003, three facilities were closed: Monticello, Indiana; Athens, Tennessee and Ripley, Tennessee. Additionally, we have moved significant amounts of production from four other U.S. facilities. In China, we are producing 25,000 motors a day at our Shenzhen facility and have begun to qualify product for manufacture in our newly acquired facilities outside of Shanghai. On a related note, we are happy to announce the pending acquisition of Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. We have a letter of intent in place, and expect to close this transaction in the next several weeks. This addition expands our motor manufacturing capability in China, by adding hermetic motor manufacturing capacity. Slide 9 Water Systems (in millions) Q3 03 Q3 02 change % ----- ----- ------ ------ Sales 155.2 154.9 0.3 0% EBIT 7.9 13.4 (5.5) -41% EBIT Margin 5.1% 8.6%
Water Systems Water Systems third quarter sales of $155 million were flat compared with the third quarter of last year. Higher sales driven by the price increase introduced earlier in the year to offset higher steel costs, as well as higher prices for flammable vapor product, and a more than 40 percent increase in sales at our Chinese operation offset lower unit sales of both residential and commercial water heaters. Operating profit of 7.9 million dollars was 5.5 million lower than last year due to the disruptions related to the flammable vapor resistant product launch discussed earlier. Slide 10 Water Systems Regulatory Changes & New Products o Flammable Vapor - All 30, 40 and 50 gallon gas water heaters; manufacturing began July 1 - All other gas heaters in 2004 o NAECA efficiency mandate - Jan. 2004 Regulatory Product Introductions The wholesaler inventory levels related to the flammable vapor resistant product pre-buy have diminished and we believe production and deliveries will return to normal in the fourth quarter. Right now, the flammable vapor resistant product line consists of all gas units in the 30, 40 and 50-gallon capacities. In 2004, the balance of the residential gas product line will be subject to the mandate. NAECA, the National Appliance and Energy Conservation Act will require an efficiency improvement of four percentage points for electric water heaters and five percentage points for gas water heaters, beginning in January 2004.
Slide 11 Water Systems Standardization Program o Leverage flammable vapor & new efficiency products to standardize the residential product line o Facility rationalization - Ashland City - residential product - McBee - commercial product - Juarez o $5 million in pretax savings in 2004 Product Standardization In connection with the introduction of the new products, we have launched a program to "standardize and customize" the Water Systems product line. This program will benefit our business in three ways: first, standardizing the basic design will allow us to build product in plants closest to their end market, maximizing logistics and shipping efficiencies. Secondly, these products, while having a standard "chassis", will allow for customized configuration further along in the assembly process, minimizing the cost of product variation. And third, this "standardize and customize" program allows us to streamline our manufacturing operation while enhancing customer service. In connection with product standardization, we recently announced plans to consolidate the North American manufacture of residential water heaters at our Ashland City, Tenn., and Juarez, Mexico, facilities. The initiative, which will involve transferring residential production from the McBee, S. C. plant, will be complete by the first quarter of 2004. At the same time, we are consolidating most of our commercial manufacturing in our McBee facility, which involves the transfer of production from Ashland City, Tennessee and El Paso, Texas. We expect the product standardization and plant rationalization programs to generate approximately $5 million in incremental savings in 2004. Slide 12 2003 Earnings Forecast 2003 est. 2002 --------- ---- Fourth Quarter $.42 - .47 $ 0.38 Full Year $1.75 - 1.80 $ 1.86
Outlook Now I'd like to talk about the outlook. As I said earlier, we are committed to inventory reduction in our motors business, which will cause underabsorption of fixed costs and margin compression in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, we expect strong margin performance in the water heater business, as the costs and disruption due to the new product launch are now behind us. In summary, we expect full year earnings of between $1.75 and $1.80 per share. Slide 13 2004 2004 Earnings Forecast $2.40 - $2.60 o Incremental pretax earnings - EPC - reduced conversion costs: $15 million - WPC regulatory changes, new product: $15 million - WPC/State standardization: $5 million As we look ahead to 2004, we have a strong base for performance. The year 2003 has been one of both challenge and accomplishment. During the year we have transferred half of our domestic motor manufacturing operations to lower cost facilities in Mexico and China. In the water heater business we have undergone the most significant product line transformation in our history. These transformations will be largely behind us by year-end, and we expect to be on track with our long-term strategic direction. Accordingly, we expect financial performance in 2004 to be in line with our strategic plan, in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This profit improvement will be driven largely by the efforts completed in 2003. In the motors business, we expect that a full year's impact of the transition to Mexico, as well as the ramp-up in China, will generate pretax earnings of $15 million. In the water heater business, a full year's sales of flammable vapor resistant product, as well as the introduction of NAECA compliant product will generate $15 million pre-tax. The focusing of commercial water heater production in our McBee, South Carolina plant, with residential product transitioned to Ashland City, Tennessee is expected to provide $5 million in pre-tax impact. These three items will generate a collective $35 million pre-tax improvement and serve as the underlying drivers for the projection of $2.40 to $2.60 per share earnings in 2004.
Slide 14 A. O. Smith Corporation Logo Q&A (Craig speaks) That completes our opening remarks and we are now ready for your questions. As a reminder please limit your inquiries to one or two questions at a time so that everyone interested has an opportunity to participate. Operator .... (Ken speaks) Conclusion While we are not happy about our financial results in the third quarter, we are confident that the programs in place will significantly enhance our operating margins In the long run. We look forward to updating you again next quarter.

Description

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 2, 2004
A. O. Smith reduces first quarter earnings estimate to $.36 per share; lowers guidance for 2004 to between $1.90 to $2.00 per share;
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today lowered its estimate for first quarter earnings to approximately $.36 per share from its previous estimate of $.46 per share and issued guidance for the second quarter for earnings to range between $.50 and $.54 per share. The company also lowered its estimate for the full year to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 per share from its previous estimate of $2.20 to $2.40.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        In the first quarter, the company experienced steel and other cost increases that were higher than expected in both its Electrical Products and Water Systems businesses. The company has announced price increases to offset the higher steel costs but these price increases will not have an impact until the latter half of the second quarter. The company will continue to monitor steel, copper, freight and other costs and initiate appropriate price increases when necessary.
        Also during the first quarter, the company's Water Systems business experienced manufacturing inefficiencies, increased logistics costs and an adjustment to inventory due to multiple conversion programs. These programs included conversion of residential water heaters to meet new efficiency standards, standardization of the A. O. Smith and State residential product lines, relocation of production between the Ashland City, Tenn., and McBee, S. C., plants and an information systems conversion. Operating issues related to the conversion programs at Water Systems will moderate as the second quarter progresses but are not expected to be eliminated until quarter-end.
        The combined effect of higher steel costs and the conversion programs are also the primary reasons for the change in second quarter earnings expectations. Earnings are expected to range between $.50 and $.54 per share compared with the $.67 per share earned in the second quarter last year.
        As a result of the reduction to the first and second quarters, the company has lowered its full-year estimate to between $1.90 and $2.00 per share.
        The company will broadcast a live conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time), and it can be heard on the company's web site, .

(Craig makes introduction)
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call. With me this morning participating in the call are Bob O'Toole, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Jones, President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Krueger, Chief Financial Officer; and John Kita; Treasurer and Controller.
Before we begin with Ken's remarks I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, could constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.
Ken will now make a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions.
Ken ...
Thank you Craig.
Good morning everyone. This morning we lowered our estimate for first quarter earnings to approximately $.36 per share, which compares with our previous projection of about $.46 per share. In addition, we are now projecting full year earnings to range between $1.90 and $2.00 per share. At our last conference call in mid January we had forecast full-year earnings to range between $2.20 and $2.40 per share.
In January, we had indicated concern over emerging raw material cost increases  particularly for steel. We also mentioned that a major OEM customer experienced a sales set back that would result in a reduction in air conditioning motor sales in 2004. Sales to the OEM customer are tracking more or less as expected. Unfortunately, raw material cost pressures have significantly increased since that time. In January steel vendors were quoting surcharges of approximately $30 per ton. More recently steel costs have been very volatile with market indications of surcharges of $100 per ton or more.
In addition to these issues, the company's Water Systems business suffered manufacturing inefficiencies, increased logistics costs and an inventory adjustment in the first quarter due to multiple conversion programs. These programs included conversion of the residential water heater products to meet new efficiency standards, a standardization of the A.O. Smith and State residential product lines, relocation of production between the Ashland City and McBee plants and an information systems conversion. These programs have particularly affected the Ashland City plant in Tennessee. Production levels declined significantly in January due to these conversions, despite an increase in manpower and overtime. Production levels have now nearly been restored to pre-conversion levels and during the next six to eight weeks we intend to maintain this production level while reducing manpower requirements and overtime expense.
The ten cent decline in our first quarter earnings, compared to our prior estimate, is equivalent to approximately $5 million before taxes. This drop was due to the steel costs and conversion issues.
We have announced price increases to offset the higher steel costs in both the Motor and Water Heater businesses, but these price increases will not have an impact until the latter half of the second quarter. We will continue to monitor steel, copper, freight and other costs and initiate price increases when necessary.
Operating issues related to the conversion programs at Water Systems will moderate as the second quarter progresses but aren't expected to be eliminated until quarter-end.
The combined effect of the higher steel costs and conversion programs are the primary reasons for the change in second quarter earnings expectations. Earnings are expected to range between $.50 and $.54 per share compared with the $.67 per share earned in the second quarter last year.
We believe these operating difficulties will be behind us as we enter the second half of the year, and that raw material cost pressures will be neutralized by price increases. However, as a result of the reduction to the first and second quarters, we have lowered our full year estimate to a range of between $1.90 and $2.00 per share.
Craig Speaks
A.O. Smith will report first quarter results on Thursday April 15 and will host a conference call at 10:00 eastern time that morning. That completes our opening remarks and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator..

Description

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 15, 2004
A. O. Smith announces first quarter earnings of $.36 per share
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced first quarter earnings of $10.8 million or $.36 per share compared with first quarter 2003 earnings of $13.7 million or $.46 per share.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 increased approximately seven percent to $416.5 million when compared with revenues of $387.9 million for the same period last year.
        "Both of our operating units were faced with higher-than-expected cost increases, particularly for steel," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, observed.
        "In addition, our Water Systems unit experienced manufacturing inefficiencies, logistics cost increases, and an adjustment to inventory that were caused by multiple conversion programs," O'Toole continued.
        "The company has announced price increases to help offset the higher steel costs, but these price increases will not have an impact until the latter half of the second quarter. We will continue to closely monitor steel and other costs and initiate appropriate pricing actions as necessary."
Electrical Products
        Electric motor sales were $223.6 million in the first quarter, about five percent higher than in the first quarter of 2003. Sales increased in all served markets except heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), which declined five percent due to the loss of a sales contract by an OEM customer.
        Operating earnings of $17.1 million were slightly lower than the same period last year. Higher costs for steel and freight more than offset cost savings related to the company's repositioning program.
Water Systems
        Water Systems first quarter sales of $192.9 million were 10 percent higher than sales in the first quarter of 2003. Improved revenue for residential water heaters due to the launch of new products to address regulatory standards changes and higher sales in China contributed to the sales increase.
        Operating profit declined to $8.8 million from the $12.0 million earned in the first quarter of last year. The operating profit decrease resulted from manufacturing inefficiencies, logistics cost increases and an adjustment to inventory caused by the conversion of residential water heaters to meet new efficiency standards, standardization of the A. O. Smith and State residential product lines, relocation of production between the Ashland City, Tenn., and McBee, S. C., plants, and an information systems conversion.
Company discussed outlook
        "The announced price increases will help offset the higher steel costs, but those increases do not take effect until later in the second quarter. We also believe the operating issues related to the conversion programs at Water Systems will moderate as this quarter progresses, but we do not expect to eliminate the issue until quarter-end," O'Toole said.
        "Consequently, we expect second quarter earnings will range between $.50 and $.54 per share compared with the $.67 per share earned in the second quarter last year. And, as a result of lower first quarter earnings and the decrease in the second quarter estimate, the company earlier this month lowered its full-year forecast to between $1.90 and $2.00 per share."
        A. O. Smith Corporation will broadcast a live conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). The call can be heard on the company's web site, . An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

A. O. Smith increases quarterly dividend; announces judgment in dip tube trial
        --Directors of A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced a $.01 increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend to a rate of $.16 per share.
Milwaukee, Wis.
        The increased dividend will apply to both Common Stock and Class A Common Stock and is payable on Aug. 16 to shareholders of record July 30.
        A judge in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (New Orleans), La., late last week entered a partial judgment in favorof A. O. Smith Corporation, its State Industries, Inc. subsidiary, and four other water heater manufacturers.
        The jury's verdict in favor of the manufacturers totaled $19 million. However, because the 12-person jury was one vote short of the required nine votes to reach a verdict on some of the remaining liability claims against Perfection Corporation, $77 million of additional damages awarded will be the subject of a partial new trial.
        Perfection Corporation of Madison, Ohio, supplied defective dip tubes to the water heater manufacturers during a period from August 1993 to October 1996. Appeals from the court's judgment are likely. The company continues to expect that all or a substantial portion of its dip tube costs will be recovered through this action or other avenues.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 15, 2004
A.O. Smith announces second quarter earnings of $.58 per share
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced second quarter earnings of $17.3 million or $.58 per share, which included a six cents per share gain from non-recurring items. The company earned $19.8 million or $.67 per share in the second quarter of 2003.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        Revenues for the quarter ended June 30 increased approximately five percent to $437.3 million compared with revenues of $417.6 million for the same period last year.
        "Both of our operating units continued to face cost pressure during the quarter brought on by significant increases in the price of steel and higher freight cost," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, observed.
        "In addition, our Water Systems unit continued to experience manufacturing inefficiencies and logistics cost increases that were caused by multiple conversion programs," O'Toole continued.
        "The company has implemented several price increases during the last four months, and these increases are now taking effect and mitigating the adverse impact of the higher steel and freight costs. We will continue to closely monitor steel and other costs and initiate appropriate pricing actions as necessary."
        For the first six months of 2004, A. O. Smith earned $28.0 million or $.94 per share compared with earnings of $33.5 million or $1.13 per share for the same period in 2003. Six-month revenues were $853.8 million compared with sales of $805.5 million for the first six months of 2003.
a.o. smith announces earnings add l
        Non-recurring items during the quarter amounted to a $2.5 million pre-tax gain. The items consisted of a favorable resolution of litigation related to pre-acquisition State Industries' Duron product, partially offset by the write-off of capitalized software at Electrical Products.
        Corporate expenses during the quarter were approximately $2.7 million higher than last year, primarily due to an insurance settlement and interest on a tax refund in 2003.
Electrical Products
        Electric motor sales were $228 million in the second quarter, the same as last year. Sales increased in all served OEM markets except the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) segment, which declined approximately 10 percent due primarily to the loss of a sales contract by an OEM customer. Aftermarket sales were flat during the quarter.
        Operating earnings of $17.4 million were lower than the same period last year. Higher costs for steel and freight more than offset cost savings related to the company's repositioning program.
Water Systems
        Water Systems' second quarter sales of $210 million were 10 percent higher than sales in the second quarter of 2003. Improved revenue for residential water heaters due to the launch of new products to address regulatory standards changes and higher sales in China contributed to the sales increase. Residential unit volume was approximately 10 percent lower than last year's second quarter due to the significant pre-buy of gas water heaters last year in anticipation of the introduction of flammable vapor ignition resistant product.
        Operating profit of $18.7 million was five percent higher than the second quarter of last year. Higher operating profit in China, the new product introductions during the

second half of 2003 and first half of this year, and the gain related to the resolution of litigation were offset by the decline in residential unit volume, manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs. Similar to the first quarter, manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs resulted from programs implemented to meet new efficiency standards, standardize A. O. Smith and State residential product lines, relocate production between the Ashland City, Tenn., and McBee, S. C., plants, and the installation of a new information management system.
Company discusses outlook
        "Although we made less progress than expected at Water Systems during the quarter, we believe efficiency levels will improve as the year proceeds. Price increases are now beginning to offset higher steel costs at both Electrical Products and Water Systems. We will continue to monitor material and freight costs closely to assure that pricing remains in line," O'Toole said.
        "We are maintaining our full-year projection of $1.90 to $2.00 per share and forecast that earnings will be in a range of $.42 to $.46 per share for the third quarter."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 13, 2004
A. O. Smith reduces third quarter, full year estimates
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today lowered its third quarter earnings estimate to break-even compared to its previous estimate of $.42 to $.46 per share. Full year earnings are now estimated to range between $.95 and $1.05 per share. Full year earnings were previously estimated at $1.90 to $2.00 per share. The revised estimates assume no further escalation in steel costs.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        Unprecedented increases in steel costs, coupled with cost increases in other materials and freight, are the principal drivers of the shortfall. Also contributing to the estimated earnings decline are reduced sales volumes for the Water Systems business and lower production volumes at the company's Ashland City, Tenn., plant.
        In July, the company noted that both of its businesses continued to face cost pressures brought on by increases in the price of steel and higher freight costs. At that time, it was noted that several price increases had been implemented in the first half of the year in an effort to offset the cost increases. Since that time, the company's steel costs have again increased significantly. Other material and freight costs have also increased.
        "The magnitude of the current steel cost increases, with the potential for further increases, has far outstripped the price increases we have accomplished to date. We are in the process of evaluating and implementing significant price increases in both businesses. Going into next year, we intend to have these new pricing structures in place in order to restore our operating margins to more normal levels," commented Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer.
        Also contributing to the decline in the earnings estimate is softness in the residential water heater market and in the company's sales to this market. In addition, while productivity levels at Ashland City are beginning to make significant improvement, the lower sales and production levels are masking much of the productivity improvement.
        A. O. Smith Corporation will broadcast a live conference call tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time). The call can be heard on the company's web site, . An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 14, 2004
A. O. Smith announces third quarter results
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced net earnings of $3.0 million or ten cents per share for the third quarter of 2004. As previously forecasted, operating earnings approximated break even for the quarter. The quarter's net earnings were positively impacted by eight cents due to a revised income tax rate for the year. The tax rate has been revised primarily due to the geographic composition of the year's earnings.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        Sales for the three-month period ended Sept. 30 were $390 million, nine percent higher than third quarter 2003 sales of $356 million.
        For the first nine months of 2004, the company earned $31.0 million or $1.04 per share compared with nine-month earnings of $39.6 million or $1.33 per share in 2003. Sales for the same nine-month period were $1.24 billion compared with $1.16 billion for the first nine months of 2003.
        "As we discussed several weeks ago, unprecedented increases in steel costs, along with cost increases for other materials and freight, have put extreme pressure on operating margins," said Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are currently implementing significant price increases at both businesses to offset the impact of the cost increases," O'Toole continued.
Electrical Products
        Third quarter sales for the manufacturer of electric motors were $216 million, more than seven percent higher than third quarter 2003 sales of $201 million. The increase in sales was driven primarily by higher sales in the pump, general industries, and ventilation and refrigeration market segments. Sales in the heating and air conditioning market segment were flat in the quarter.
a. o. smith third quarter add l
        Operating earnings for the quarter were $12.6 million compared with earnings of $9.6 million for the same period in 2003, as the higher volumes and improved earnings from the company's repositioning program helped offset raw material and freight cost increases.
        The company recently announced that Chris Mapes has been named president of the Electrical Products business. Mapes, who has prior industry experience, has assumed full profit and loss responsibility for the operating unit.
Water Systems
        Sales of $174 million were 12 percent higher than the third quarter of 2003 due to increased pricing and higher sales of both commercial and residential product, as well as continued strong performance in China.
        Water Systems experienced an operating loss of $2.1 million in the third quarter compared to operating income of $7.9 million in 2003. The reduction in earnings was due to the significant increases in steel costs, higher costs for other raw materials and freight, and manufacturing costs at its Ashland City, Tenn., plant. These cost increases more than offset volume and pricing gains.
Outlook
        As a result of the revised income tax rate, the company now projects current year earnings to range between $1.05 and $1.10 per share.
        A. O. Smith Corporation will broadcast a live conference call this morning at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time). The call can be heard on the company's web site, . An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 21, 2005
A. O. Smith announces 2004 earnings of $35 million or $1.18 per share
        A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced fourth quarter earnings of $4.4 million or $.15 per share. Full-year earnings were $35.4 million or $1.18 per share.
Milwaukee, Wis.
        Sales for the 12-month period of $1.65 billion were eight percent higher than 2003 sales of $1.53 billion. Fourth quarter sales were $409.4 million compared with fourth quarter 2003 sales of $368.8 million.
        "Two issues adversely impacted our 2004 performance," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "At the beginning of the year, manufacturing inefficiencies in our Water Systems business led to a decline in that unit's profitability. That issue has been resolved, and Water Systems' operations were operating at normal levels by year-end."
        "The more significant problem we faced was in the area of material and freight costs. Unprecedented cost increases, principally steel, put pressure on our operating margins throughout the year," O'Toole continued. "In spite of two price increases that took effect during 2004 in our electric motor and water heater businesses, we were unable to recover all of the material cost increases. Additional price increases took effect January 1 in order to return to more normal margin levels."
Electrical Products
        Full-year sales for Electrical Products Company were $860.7 million, approximately four percent higher than the prior year. Increased sales in the pump,
a. o. smith earnings add l
general industries, and distribution market segments helped to offset a decrease in the heating and air conditioning segment. Production of electric motors from the company's manufacturing operations in China increased more than 20 percent when compared with the prior year.
        Full-year operating earnings were $51.5 million, five percent lower than the $54.2 million earned in 2003 due to higher material and freight costs.
        For the quarter ended December 31, sales were $193.6 million compared with fourth quarter 2003 sales of $182.7 million. Operating earnings were $4.4 million compared with earnings of $8.3 million for the same period in 2003. Fourth quarter profitability was negatively impacted by freight and material costs.
Water Systems
        Sales for Water Systems in 2004 were $792.4 million, more than 12 percent higher than 2003 sales of $706.1 million. The company benefited from improved sales of commercial water heaters, strong growth in its China operation, and higher pricing.
        Operating earnings were $36.8 million in 2004 compared with earnings of $57.2 million the prior year. Significantly higher costs for steel, other raw materials, and freight and manufacturing inefficiencies during the first three quarters more than offset the higher volumes and improved pricing.
        Fourth quarter sales were $215.8 million, nearly 16 percent higher than fourth quarter 2003 sales of $186.1 million. Operating earnings were $11.4 million compared with fourth quarter 2003 earnings of $19.5 million. The earnings decline was attributable to material costs.
Company discusses outlook
        "We have implemented significant price increases in both of our businesses, the most recent one being effective with the beginning of this year," said O'Toole. "These
a. o. smith earnings add 2
price increases have been put in place to offset the negative impact of material and freight cost increases. While we are generally pleased with the impact and acceptance of the new price levels, it is far too early to project their ultimate impact and acceptance. Accordingly, we have determined that we will not provide a forecast of earnings per share at this time."

Exhibit 99
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 15, 2005
 
A. O. Smith reports first quarter earnings of $.48 per share;
 
Bolstered by strong operating performance from its water heater business, A. O. Smith Corporation
Milwaukee, Wis.
(AOS-NYSE) today announced first quarter earnings of $14.3 million or $.48 per share, a 32 percent increase over last year.
 
Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $409.2 million, lower than first quarter 2004 revenues of $416.5 million.
 
"Enhanced operating efficiency and improved pricing in the Water Systems unit had a positive impact on first quarter results and more than offset an operating profit decline in Electrical Products," Robert J. O'Toole, chairman and chief executive officer, indicated.
 
"Sales volumes, however, were disappointing, as both Electrical Products and Water Systems experienced lingering effects from customers increasing their fourth quarter purchases in advance of the January price increase and reduced motor demand on the part of some customers."
 
Water Systems
 
Sales of residential and commercial water heaters increased approximately five percent to $202.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, reflecting improved pricing in the U.S. and continued sales growth in the China market, offset by unit volume declines in U.S. residential and commercial sales.
 
Operating profit increased from $8.8 million in the first quarter of 2004 to $20.8 million in the first quarter this year. The increase was the result of significantly improved efficiency throughout Water Systems' operations, improved pricing, and a positive adjustment to warranty reserves due to a change in estimates.
 
 
a. o. smith first quarter earnings add l
 
Pricing levels are now in place to offset the 2004 increases in steel, freight and other material costs, with gross margins returning to more normal historic levels.
 
The company also announced that it will begin construction to double the size of its operations in Nanjing, China, to meet the increased demand for its residential and commercial water heaters in that country. The first phase of the expansion, which begins later this quarter, will be complete by the first half of 2006. Sales to the China market reached record levels in 2004 increasing 37 percent over the prior year and are expected to exceed $70 million in 2005.
 
Electrical Products
 
Electric motor sales declined approximately seven percent to $207.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Price increases, established to mitigate higher material and freight costs, were more than offset by lower unit volumes. Unit volume declines were due to fourth quarter purchases ahead of the January price increase and reduced customer demand, in some cases due to the higher prices.
 
Operating earnings declined to $12.5 million compared with first quarter 2004 earnings of $17.1 million as a result of the reduced sales volume.
 
The company announced plans to close its Bray, Ireland, plant which manufactures hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. The company will consolidate operations into existing plants in North America and China, and the closing of the Bray plant will be complete by the end of the second quarter. During the quarter the company had announced the acceleration of planned product repositioning programs at several of its U.S. motor operations. Restructuring costs will approximate $11.5 million on a pre-tax basis and $10.5 million after tax. There is no tax deduction available for the Bray plant closure costs estimated to be approximately $8.5 million. Approximately $600,000 of the after-tax restructuring costs
 
 
a. o. smith first quarter earnings add 2
 
fell in the first quarter. Second quarter after-tax charges will be approximately $9.5 million, with the remainder falling in the second half of the year. Annualized pre-tax savings from these actions will approximate $7 million.
 
Company discusses outlook
 
"We believe the operational improvements evidenced in the first quarter and improved pricing will continue to have a positive impact on our business throughout the year," O'Toole said. "The restructuring actions at Electrical Products will improve their operating performance later this year."
 
"We forecast that 2005 earnings will range between $1.45 to $1.65 per share, including $10.5 million after-tax restructuring expense, equivalent to $1.80 to $2.00 per share before restructuring. This represents a substantial improvement over the $1.18 earned in the prior year."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

A. O. Smith reduces forecast for 2005
 
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today lowered its forecast for 2005 to a range of between $1.25 and $1.45 per share, from the previously communicated forecast of $1.45 to $1.65 per share. The company expects earnings for the second quarter to range between $.15 and $.20 a share. As previously announced, the company will record an estimated $.35 annual charge for restructuring which includes approximately $.30 in the second quarter. Excluding the restructuring charge, the company expects to earn between $1.60 and $1.80 per share for the year and $.45 to $.50 per share for the quarter.
Milwaukee, Wis.
 
After reviewing water heater industry shipment data for April and May, which declined 14 percent in residential and 25 percent in commercial compared with 2004, the company is reducing its projection for industry shipments for the year. The company believes this lower commercial and residential market projection is primarily caused by higher than expected wholesale inventories. As a result, the company has reduced its projection for full year sales and earnings at its Water Systems business.
 
Expectations for the Electrical Products business are essentially unchanged from the company's outlook at the time of its earnings forecast in April.
 
A.O. Smith will issue its second quarter earnings results on July 15, 2005, and will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
July 15, 2005
 
A. O. Smith announces second quarter earnings
 
Milwaukee, Wis.A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced second quarter earnings of $6.5 million or $.22 per share. The reported earnings include the impact of an after-tax charge of $7.9 million or $.26 per share primarily related to a previously announced restructuring program.
 
Excluding the charge, second quarter earnings were $14.4 million or $.48 per share compared with $17.3 million or $.58 per share in 2004. Sales for the three-month period ending June 30 were $438 million, unchanged from the same period last year.
 
For the first six months of 2005, A. O. Smith earned $20.8 million or $.69 per share compared with six-month 2004 earnings of $28.0 million or $.94 per share. Excluding the after-tax charges of $8.5 million or $.28 per share, six month earnings were $29.3 million or $.97 per share.
 
Six month sales were $847 million, slightly lower than sales of $854 million for the same period in 2004.
 
"On June 24
th
we reduced our forecast for 2005 to a range of between $1.60 and $1.80 per share, from $1.80 to $2.00 per share, excluding the impact of the $.35 restructuring program announced with our first quarter results," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. O'Toole commented.
 
"This change in forecast is primarily the result of an inventory buildup in the wholesale water heater distribution channel, which has adversely affected demand for both commercial and residential product during the first half of 2005. We expect the channel to clear as we progress through the balance of the year."
 
Water Systems
 
Although the company saw a favorable impact from improved pricing and a thirty percent sales increase in the China Water Heater business, second quarter sales declined approximately $6 million to $204 million because of softer customer demand in the North American market.
Operating earnings of $18.8 million were similar to the second quarter of 2004 as significantly improved operating efficiency and improved pricing to cover higher material costs offset the impact of lower North American unit volumes. Last year's second quarter results included a non-recurring pretax gain of approximately $3.3 million from the favorable resolution of litigation related to pre-acquisition State Industries' Duron product.
 
Electrical Products
 
Second quarter sales of $235 million in the company's electric motor operation were modestly higher than 2004 as improved pricing more than offset weaker demand primarily in markets adversely affected by cooler weather.
 
Operating earnings were $6.0 million, or $13.4 million excluding a $7.4 million pretax restructuring charge, compared with $17.4 million last year. Though improved pricing offset higher material costs, reduced contribution on lower volume and reduced operating efficiencies resulted in a decline in operating profit. Plant efficiency was adversely affected by inventory reduction initiatives.
 
Restructuring & Other Costs
 
In the second quarter the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $8.6 million for restructuring and other costs. In addition to the $7.4 million charge at Electrical Products, primarily related to the closure of its Bray, Ireland facility, there was also a $1.2 million expense related to a contingent leasing liability at its discontinued Automotive Products operation which was recorded as a corporate expense.
 
Other Matters
 
During the quarter the company received a $28 million payment against its dip tube receivable leaving a balance of approximately $6 million that will be collected in the second half of this year. This will result in the complete recovery of receivables associated with this dispute. All litigation associated with this issue has been concluded.
 
Concurrent with this receipt, the company elected to make a voluntary contribution of $30 million to its pension plan.
 
GSW Acquisition
 
The company has signed a letter of intent to acquire GSW of Canada, a manufacturer and marketer of consumer durable products, including water heaters and building products. GSW had 2004 sales of approximately $US 470 million. The company has initiated the customary regulatory review process in both the United States and Canada.
Company discusses outlook
 
"Last month we issued guidance for 2005 of earnings ranging between $1.25 and $1.45 per share, or $1.60 to $1.80 before restructuring and other charges," O'Toole said.
 
A.O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

A. O. Smith announces third quarter earnings
 
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced third quarter earnings of $9.7 million or $.32 per share. The reported earnings include an after-tax charge of $2.0 million or $.07 per share for restructuring and other charges related to previously discussed repositioning activities in the company's motor business.
Milwaukee, Wis.
 
Excluding the charge, third quarter earnings were $11.7 million or $.39 per share compared with $3.0 million or $.10 per share in 2004. Sales for the three-month period ending September 30 were $408 million, compared to $390 million in the same period in 2004.
 
For the first nine months of 2005, A. O. Smith earned $30.5 million or $1.01 per share compared with nine-month 2004 earnings of $31.0 million or $1.04 per share. Excluding an after-tax charge of $10.5 million for restructuring and other charges or $.35 per share, primarily related to closing the company's Bray, Ireland, motor facility, nine month earnings were $41.0 million or $1.36 per share.
 
Sales for the nine months ending September 30, 2005, were approximately $1.26 billion, similar to nine month sales in 2004.
 
"A. O. Smith made good progress during the third quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. O'Toole commented. "We believe unusually high wholesale water heater industry inventories, a problem in the second quarter, have returned to more normal levels. In addition, our year-to-date company-wide gross profit margin has improved nicely over the prior year. Furthermore, the working capital initiatives we have implemented throughout the year have resulted in significant improvements in cash flow."
Electrical Products
 
Third quarter sales of $211 million in the company's electric motor operation were modestly lower than 2004 as a result of softer sales for HVAC applications.
 
Operating profit in the third quarter, which reflects a $3.0 million pretax charge for restructuring and other charges, was $11.6 million compared with $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Water Systems
 
Sales in the company's Water Systems business improved 14 percent to $199 million compared with the third quarter of 2004. Operating earnings improved to $14.5 million compared with an operating loss of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2004 as a result of a return to gross profit margins closer to historical levels, improved operating efficiencies, and the incremental earnings from a 50 percent increase in sales in the company's China-based water heater operation.
 
GSW Acquisition
 
On June 24
th
the company announced that it was in discussions to acquire GSW, Inc. of Canada, a manufacturer and marketer of consumer durable products, including water heaters and building products. GSW had 2004 sales of approximately $470 million (US).
 
The acquisition is subject to regulatory review in both the United States and Canada and on July 24, the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a second request for information. A. O. Smith and GSW expect decisions by regulatory bodies in both jurisdictions by mid-December.
 
Outlook
 
"We are now projecting that full-year earnings for 2005 will range between $1.35 and $1.45 per share, or $1.70 and $1.80 per share before restructuring and other charges of approximately $10.7 million after taxes or $.35 per share," commented O'Toole.
 
"The earnings estimate excludes the potential favorable impact of a significant pre-buy of motors related to the implementation of the new 13 SEER energy efficiency mandate."
 
A.O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 20, 2006
 
A. O. Smith announces record fourth quarter earnings of $.52 per share and reaches agreement to acquire GSW
 
Bolstered by record fourth quarter sales and operating earnings, A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced full-year 2005 net earnings of $46.5 million or $1.54 per share. The company reported fourth quarter earnings of $.52 per share after an $.08 per share charge for restructuring and other expenses.
Milwaukee, Wis.
 
A. O. Smith also announced reaching agreement with the two majority shareholders of GSW Inc. on A. O. Smith's pending acquisition of the Canadian-based company. The parties have agreed to a purchase price of $115 (Canadian) per share for the shares owned by the two majority shareholders and confirmed the price will be made available to all shareholders. This equates to a purchase price of approximately $393.5 million (Canadian).
 
A. O. Smith 2005 Earnings
 
A. O. Smith's reported 2005 earnings include an after-tax charge of $12.9 million or $.42 per share for restructuring and other charges related primarily to repositioning activities in the company's electric motor business during the second quarter of the year. Excluding the charge, 2005 net earnings were $59.4 million or $1.96 per share compared with 2004 earnings of $35.4 million or $1.18 per share.
 
Sales for the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2005, were a record $1.69 billion, slightly higher than 2004 sales of $1.65 billion.
 
Fourth quarter sales increased six percent to $434 million. Record fourth quarter net earnings of $16.0 million or $.52 per share included restructuring and other charges of $2.4 million after taxes, or $.08 per share. Excluding the charge, fourth quarter earnings were $18.4 million or $.60 per share, compared with fourth quarter 2004 earnings of $4.4 million or $.15 per share. The fourth quarter after-tax charge consisted of $1.7 million related to the company's previously owned automotive and storage products operations and $.7 million for additional repositioning in the company's electric motor business.
 
"The company made notable progress during 2005 in achieving improved profitability," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented. "The Water Systems unit significantly improved its performance in 2005 with record operating earnings and a full-year operating margin of almost 10 percent. Electrical Products has taken significant actions to improve profitability with its repositioning program and is in a position to make further improvements this year."
 
"While material and energy costs remained high throughout 2005, improved pricing, logistics management, and efficiency throughout our operations offset the higher costs," Jones pointed out. "Two other bright spots during 2005 were the company's generation of $188 million in operating cash flow and the continued strength at our Chinese water heater operation which recorded a 45 percent increase in sales.
 
"Overall, we were quite pleased with our performance in 2005 and excellent progress towards our longer-term objectives," Jones commented.
 
Electrical Products
 
Full-year sales for the Electrical Products segment were approximately $861 million, unchanged from 2004, as softer unit demand was offset by improved pricing.
 
Operating earnings for 2005 were $42.3 million compared with $51.5 million in 2004. Adjusted for restructuring expenses of $12.6 million before taxes, primarily related to the closure of the company's Bray, Ireland, motor facility, operating earnings were $54.9 million, representing a margin of 6.4 percent.
 
Fourth quarter sales of $209 million increased eight percent over the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting higher sales of HVAC product driven by inventory replenishment related to a late season surge in the air conditioning market as well as the upcoming 13 SEER air conditioning efficiency mandate.
 
Fourth quarter operating earnings of $12.0 million were substantially higher than the $4.4 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2004. Adjusted for pretax restructuring expenses of $1.3 million, fourth quarter operating earnings were $13.3 million.
 
In November, the company completed its purchase of Yueyang Zhongmin Special Electrical Machinery Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of hermetic motors located in Yueyang City, Hunan Province, China. The company manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications and is expected to add between $.03 and $.05 to A. O. Smith's earnings in 2006.
 
Water Systems
 
Water Systems 2005 sales of $833 million were five percent higher than 2004 due primarily to the 45 percent sales increase in China and improved pricing that more than offset a decline in unit volumes in the U. S. residential and commercial market.
 
Record operating earnings of $79.5 million were more than double the prior year as a result of a return to more normal gross profit margins, improved operating efficiencies, and incremental earnings from the significant increase in sales at the company's China-based water heater operation
 
Operating margin rose to 9.5 percent from last year's level of 4.6 percent.
 
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2005, sales increased six percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 due primarily to a 53 percent increase in sales in China.
 
Fourth quarter Water Systems operating earnings were $25.4 million, or 11.2 percent of sales. The fourth quarter operating performance resulted from the restoration of a more normal gross profit margin, the higher sales in China, improved manufacturing efficiency, and a $3 million LIFO benefit associated with lower inventory levels.
 
Cash Flow
 
The company generated significantly improved operating cash flow in 2005 of $188 million, up from $67 million in 2005. In addition to higher earnings, the significant improvement was largely driven by a $79 million year-over-year reduction in net working capital items.
 
The company's debt-to-capital ratio of 22 percent benefited from the $188 million of operating cash flow and declined significantly compared with the 32 percent ratio recorded at the end of 2004.
 
GSW Acquisition
 
The agreement between A. O. Smith and the majority shareholders of GSW equates to a purchase price of approximately $393.5 million (Canadian) and is conditional upon A. O. Smith successfully completing its remaining due diligence review and negotiating definitive agreements. On Jan. 17, A. O. Smith received approval under the Investment Canada Act to proceed with the proposed acquisition; and the U. S. Justice Department and Canadian Competition Bureau have also favorably concluded their antitrust investigations. Under the agreement, A. O. Smith maintains the exclusive rights to pursue the acquisition of the majority shareholders' shares. The company expects to complete due diligence and submit a tender offer for all outstanding GSW shares in February and, if successful, will target to conclude the transaction by the end of the first quarter.
 
GSW, with 2004 sales of approximately $580 million (Canadian), is comprised of two business segments  water heating and building products. The water heating segment manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the U.S. and Canada through its American Water Heater Company and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries. The water heater segment reported sales of approximately $540 million (Canadian) in 2004.
 
GSW's Building Products business, with 2004 sales of approximately $40 million (Canadian), manufactures and markets vinyl rain ware systems primarily for North
 
American retail customers.
 
The company employs over 1,700 people at its three operating divisions in Canada and the United States. GSW is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols GSW.a and GSW.sv.b.
 
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
 
Forward-looking statements
 
A. O. Smith has made forward-looking statements in this document pertaining to the planned acquisition of GSW that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Such statements include the expected timing of the acquisition. For all forward looking statements, the company cautions that important factors, such as satisfactory completion of due diligence and negotiation of definitive agreements, could cause actual events to differ.

On February 8, 2006, A. O. Smith Corporation issued a news release forecasting its earnings for 2006. The news release is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.1, and its contents are incorporated by reference herein.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
The following exhibit is being filed herewith:
 
(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated February 8, 2006.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 8, 2006.
 

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 8, 2006
 
 
A. O. Smith forecasts 2006 earnings of $2.30 - $2.50 per share
 
 
This press release includes forward looking statements of A. O. Smith Corporation pertaining to the planned acquisition of GSW. Such statements are based on A. O. Smith projections that reflect historical information concerning GSW Inc., A. O. Smith's projections concerning future results of GSW Inc., and certain assumptions by A. O. Smith. Accordingly, such statements are solely the responsibility of A. O. Smith and should not be attributed in any way to GSW Inc. GSW Inc. assumes no responsibility for these estimates.
 
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today issued a forecast for 2006 net earnings of between $2.30 and $2.50 per share. The 2006 forecast includes expected nine-month earnings accretion of $.35 per share for the company's pending acquisition of GSW, after taking into account the effect of purchase accounting, transaction costs, and expected synergies available to both the company's existing Water Systems unit and GSW.
Milwaukee, Wis.
 
A. O. Smith had net earnings of $46.5 million or $1.54 per share in 2005, after restructuring and other charges of approximately $12.9 million, or $.42 per share.
 
As announced Feb. 3, A. O. Smith has secured a deposit agreement with the majority shareholders of GSW. Additionally, the board of directors of GSW has determined that the offer is fair and is recommending it to all of GSW's shareholders.
 
A. O. Smith indicated it would initiate a tender offer for all shares of GSW later this month and expects to complete the transaction by the end of March.
 
"We are very excited about our impending acquisition of GSW, and we intend to build on the successes achieved by both A. O. Smith and GSW in 2005," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented. "Our Water Systems unit significantly improved its performance with record operating earnings and a full-year operating margin of almost 10 percent, and we are very enthusiastic about the possibilities of combining these two strong businesses."
 
"Additionally, Electrical Products took important steps to increase profitability in 2005 and has positioned itself to make further improvements this year."
 
Electrical Products
 
In 2005, the Electrical Products business reported full-year sales of approximately $861 million and operating profit of $42.3 million after restructuring costs of $12.6 million before tax. The company expects pre-tax cost savings from the restructuring of approximately $8 million in 2006.
 
Electrical Products expects to report higher sales and profits in 2006 as a result of new program wins, the acquisition of the Yueyang Zhongmin commercial hermetic motors business in China, and the benefits from last year's restructuring initiatives. The company is projecting sales of approximately $60 million from new business, including Yueyang, which is expected to add sales of between $15 and $20 million and generate incremental earnings of as much as $.05 per share.
 
These gains will be partially offset by higher costs for copper, as well as higher peso costs, increased freight expense, and higher employee costs, particularly health care and pension expense.
 
Additionally, because of the record-breaking performance in the air conditioning market in 2005, the company believes that the HVAC market could prove difficult in the
 
second half of the year, especially if extended cool spring weather tempers the normal air conditioning buying season.
 
Water Systems
 
Water Systems reported record sales and operating profit in 2005 of $833 million and $79.5 million, respectively. Sales were $41 million or five percent higher than 2004 due primarily to a $27 million, or 45 percent sales increase in China. Operating margin rose to 9.5 percent in 2005.
 
Water Systems is projecting higher sales and income in 2006. Sales are expected to increase modestly as a result of improved residential wholesale water heater market penetration and growth in the market for commercial water heaters. Additionally, China is expected to grow at least 20 percent in 2006 to more than $100 million from $86 million in 2005.
 
In spite of concerns about potential cost volatility for raw materials and freight and related pricing offsets, the company believes it could generate an operating margin of approximately 10 percent of sales in 2006, before inclusion of the GSW operating results.
 
GSW
 
With 2004 sales of approximately $500 million (U.S.), GSW is made up of two business segments  water heating and building products. The water heating segment, with 2004 sales of approximately $465 million, manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the U.S. and Canada through its American Water Heater Company and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries. The Building Products business, with 2004 sales of approximately $35 million, manufactures and markets vinyl rain ware systems primarily for North American retail customers.
 
A. O. Smith anticipates a fairly straightforward integration that will optimize operational and logistical efficiencies and that is expected to be completed by the end of next year.
A. O. Smith is projecting that the inclusion of nine months of GSW's earnings for 2006 will add approximately $11 million (U.S.) of after tax income, or $.35 per share, to A. O. Smith's earnings for 2006, after taking into account the effect of purchase accounting, transaction costs, and expected synergies available to both the company's existing Water Systems unit and GSW.
 
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

(1) comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules, regulations, policies and notices of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities applicable thereto;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company is required to pay the Termination Fee, then Company will not be required to pay the Expense Amount.
Expense Amount
(4) Company acknowledges that the amounts payable under this section 3.1 in respect of a Fee Event represent liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of damages, including opportunity costs, which the Parent will suffer or incur as a result of the Fee Event and are not a penalty.

For greater certainty, the parties agree that the compensation or damages to be received pursuant to this section 3.1 is the sole remedy in compensation or damages of Parent and the Offeror in those circumstances in which the compensation or damages are payable; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section 3.1 shall relieve or have the effect of relieving Company in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by Parent or the Offeror as a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement, including the intentional or wilful making of a misrepresentation in this Agreement (including the Schedules).  Nothing herein shall preclude Parent or the Offeror from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements of Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenant or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

The Company may increase the credit facility up to $500 million, subject to certain conditions and payment of additional fees.
The Company will guarantee the obligations of A. O. Smith Enterprises Ltd. under the Credit Agreement to the extent A. O. Smith Enterprises Ltd. will borrow directly under the Credit Agreement. All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Taxes
(b) If either Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or either Agent, then:

(ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law; and
(iv) such Borrower shall also pay to the applicable Agent for the account of any applicable Lender or such Agent, at the time interest is paid, all additional amounts which such Lender or such Agent specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender or such Agent would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.

Thereafter, the obligation of the U.S. Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing.

The Company used available cash and $224 million (U.S.) borrowed under the terms of a February 17, 2006, credit agreement between the Company and Bank of America, as Administrative Agent.
GSW is made up of two business segments, water heating and building products. The water heating segment manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the U.S. and Canada through its American Water Heater Company and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 3, 2006
A. O. Smith completes acquisition of GSW
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today completed its acquisition of GSW Inc. GSW, a Canadian-based manufacturer of water heaters and building products, with 2005 sales of approximately $520 million (U.S.), was acquired for approximately $340 million in cash.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The addition of GSW to A. O. Smith's existing water heater operations enhances A. O. Smith's position in the growing retail channel of the U. S. residential water heater market segment as well as increases its presence in the Canadian water heater market.
" GSW is a very well-run business with talented people and productive operations in the U. S. and Canada," Ajita G. Rajendra, president of A. O. Smith Water Products Company, pointed out. "This combination of products, brands, and people enhances A. O. Smith's status as one of the leading global suppliers of residential and commercial water heaters."
"The addition of GSW's American Water Heater Company partners us with Lowe's, one of the leaders in the home improvement industry," Rajendra continued. "As we integrate the GSW business, we intend to take advantage of our manufacturing capabilities to enhance our ability to serve the needs of our customers throughout the world."
A. O. Smith expects to generate savings of $3 million in 2006 resulting primarily from reduced administrative expenses and reduced costs for raw materials. The company forecasts earnings accretion in 2006 from the acquisition, including these synergies, to total approximately $.35 per share or $11 million after taxes.
a. o. smith completes gsw acquisition add l
The company projects synergy savings between $10 and $15 million before taxes in 2007 as manufacturing and logistical efficiencies come on line. In combination with operating profit and net of interest and taxes, the acquisition is expected to generate earnings accretion of between $.60 and $.70 per share in 2007.
As of today, A. O. Smith has acquired approximately 98 percent of both the outstanding Class A and Class B shares of GSW Inc. The company intends to acquire the remainder of the Class A and Class B shares not tendered by means of a compulsory acquisition under the "Canada Business Corporations Act" at the same price as the offer price.
GSW is made up of two business segments, water heating and building products. The water heating segment manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the U.S. and Canada through its American Water Heater Company and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries. The water heater segment reported 2005 sales of $490 million (U.S.). The 2005 sales of the Building Products business were $30 million (U.S.).
The American Water Heater business, located in Johnson City, Tenn., markets residential and commercial water heaters under the American PROLine and U. S. Craftsmaster brands. It is also the exclusive supplier of water heaters to Lowe's, supplying residential gas and electric units carrying the Whirlpool brand.
In Canada, GSW manufactures residential and commercial water heaters under the GSW and John Wood  brands at its plant in Fergus, Ontario, approximately 75 miles west of Toronto.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 18, 2006
A. O. Smith reports improved first quarter earnings
on 12 percent sales increase
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced first quarter 2006 net earnings of $15.5 million or $.50 per share. Net earnings included an after-tax loss of approximately $3.1 million or $.10 per share from foreign currency contracts related to financing of the GSW acquisition.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Excluding the currency loss, first quarter earnings were $18.6 million or $.60 per share compared with first quarter 2005 net earnings of $14.3 million or $.48 per share. Additional currency transactions related to the completion of the acquisition, subsequent to the close of the first quarter, will result in an offsetting currency gain of approximately $3.2 million or $.10 per share in the second quarter.
Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $459.2 million, a 12 percent increase over the first quarter of 2005. Reported results do not include GSW, which was acquired during the first week of April, following the close of the first quarter.
"Operating performance was strong in the first quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented. "A 14 percent increase in sales at Water Products, resulting from higher sales of residential product, a stronger market for commercial water heaters, and continued growth in China, generated an operating margin of more than 11 percent."
"Sales at Electrical Products grew more than 10 percent in the quarter but earnings improvement was tempered by higher costs for utilities and freight."
"Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of GSW and have started the
a. o. smith first quarter add l
integration process. GSW and American Water Heater Company have outstanding customers, and we look forward to continuing to serve their water heater needs. At the same time, we are pleased to welcome the employees from GSW and American Water Heater Company into the A. O. Smith family," Jones added.
Water Products
First quarter sales of $231.3 million were 14 percent higher than the comparable period last year, reflecting higher sales of residential product, a stronger commercial market, and significantly higher sales in China. First quarter sales in China increased 43 percent to $24 million.
Operating earnings increased 25 percent to $25.9 million due to the higher sales, generating an operating profit margin of 11.2 percent of sales.
Electrical Products
First quarter sales of $229.2 million were 11 percent higher than the same period in 2005 due to higher sales of HVAC-related products, as well as new programs, and increased volumes in the distribution market.
Operating earnings increased nine percent to $13.6 million. Despite the higher sales, earnings improvement was partially offset by increased costs for utilities and freight. Electrical Products' first quarter operating margin was 5.9 percent, slightly lower than in the same period last year.
GSW
On April 4, the company completed its acquisition of GSW, a Canadian-based manufacturer of water heaters and building products, for approximately $340 (U. S.) million in cash. GSW's 2005 sales were approximately $520 million (U.S.).
The addition of GSW to A. O. Smith's existing water heater operations expands the company's position in both the growing retail channel of the U.S. residential water heater market segment, as well as in the commercial and residential segments of the Canadian water heater market.
a. o. smith first quarter add 2
A. O. Smith expects to generate savings of $3 million in 2006 primarily from reduced costs for raw materials. The company forecasts earnings accretion in 2006 from the acquisition, including these synergies, to total approximately $.35 per share or $11 million after taxes.
The company projects synergy savings of between $10 and $15 million before taxes in 2007 as manufacturing and logistical efficiencies come on line. In combination with operating profit and net of interest and taxes, the acquisition is expected to generate earnings accretion of between $.60 and $.70 per share in 2007.
GSW is made up of two business segments, water heating and building products. The water heating segment manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the U.S. and Canada through its American Water Heater Company and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries. The water heater segment reported 2005 sales of $490 million (U.S.). The 2005 sales of the Building Products business were $30 million (U.S.). A. O. Smith indicated it is exploring its strategic alternatives regarding the Building Products business.
Though not consolidated in A. O. Smith's first quarter results, GSW's first quarter sales and operating earnings were slightly higher than in the same period of 2005. Following the completion of the $340 (U. S.) million acquisition earlier this month, A. O. Smith's debt-to-capital ratio increased to approximately 46 percent compared with approximately 24 percent at the close of the first quarter on March 31.
Outlook
A. O. Smith forecasts 2006 earnings of between $2.30 and $2.50 per share, which includes expected nine-month earnings accretion of $.35 per share from the acquisition of GSW.
Excluding GSW, the base water products business is projecting higher sales and income in 2006. Sales are expected to increase modestly as a result of improved
a. o. smith first quarter add 3
residential wholesale water heater segment penetration and growth in the commercial water heater segment. Additionally, sales from the company's operation in China are expected to exceed $100 million compared with $86 million in 2005.
In spite of concerns about potential cost volatility for raw materials and freight, the company believes its Water Products company will generate a full-year operating margin in excess of 10 percent of sales in 2006, before inclusion of the GSW operating results.
Electrical Products expects to report higher sales and profits in 2006. Higher sales will result from improved pricing to offset higher material costs, new business, and the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of the Yueyang Zhongmin commercial hermetic motors business in China. In addition to the higher volume, earnings will also benefit from last year's restructuring initiatives.
These gains will be partially offset by higher costs for copper, as well as strengthening of the Mexican peso, increased freight expense, and higher employee costs, particularly health care and pension expenses.
Additionally, because of the record-breaking performance in the air-conditioning segment in 2005, the company believes that the HVAC segment could prove difficult in the second half of the year, especially if extended cool spring weather tempers the normal air-conditioning buying season.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Directors of GSW Inc.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of GSW Inc. as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
GSW Inc. ("the Company") is incorporated under the laws of Canada. The Company is involved in the water products business and in the building products business. The water products business consists of the GSW Water Heating division of GSW Water Products Inc. and American Water Heater Company ("AWHC") which manufactures and distributes gas, electric and oil-fired water heaters and related products principally for the North American market, and of Flame Guard Water Heaters, Inc. who owns and licenses certain technology. The building products business consists of GSW Building Products, which manufactures and distributes vinyl rainware systems and vinyl railings systems for the North American market.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting policies.
Principles of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries from the dates of their acquisition. All significant intercompany amounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and market value. Cost is determined principally on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost includes material, labour and variable and fixed manufacturing overhead costs. Market value is net realizable value for finished goods and work-in-process and replacement cost for raw materials.
Capital assets
Capital assets are stated at acquisition cost, including transportation and installation charges. Capital assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the following methods and rates:
 
 
GSW Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
No amortization is recorded on assets until the asset is placed into use. Capital assets that are no longer in productive use are written down to net realizable value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title passes and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from technology licensing is recognized according to the terms of the contract. Cash received in advance of revenue being recognized is recorded as deferred revenue.
Long-term liabilities
Product liability and insurance loss reserve
The Company is insured for product liability through the purchase of commercial insurance, a part of which is reinsured by a qualified insurance company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The qualified insurance company maintains loss reserves that include provisions for known claims and for claims incurred but not reported that are established and adjusted in accordance with generally accepted loss forecasting principles and models prepared by an independent loss reserve specialist. The qualified insurance company, as required under the terms of its reinsurance agreement, maintains collateral to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement.
As a condition of the acquisition in 2002 of American Water Heater Company by a wholly-owned subsidiary, the subsidiary assumed the obligation to settle all future product liability claims related to product sold prior to acquisition. The purchase method of accounting for business combinations required the product liability reserve to include a provision for future claims related to product sold prior to acquisition, even though the incidents giving rise to this obligation had not occurred as of the date of acquisition. This reserve is drawn down as the population of products in service as at the time of acquisition decreases.
Warranty
Anticipated costs related to product warranty are recorded in the year in which the product is sold.
Employee benefit plans
The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans and the related costs, net of plan assets.
The costs of providing defined contribution pensions and certain other employee benefits are charged to operations as they are paid.
The costs of defined benefit pensions and certain employee benefits are actuarially determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service and Management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. Plan assets are valued at fair value.
 
GSW Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
Adjustments arising from plan amendments, changes in actuarial assumptions, and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market value of the plan assets or the benefit obligation at the beginning of the year are amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service life of the related employee group.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks and investments in other commercial instruments with terms of three months or less at the date of acquisition. These instruments are carried at cost that approximates market value.
Marketable securities
Marketable securities consist of US-dollar-denominated government bonds and other rated institutional bonds. Government and institutional bonds are stated at their amortized cost. Premiums or discounts arising on acquisition of the bonds are amortized over the period to maturity. The carrying value of the bonds is reduced to recognize a decline in the value of the investment that is other than temporary.
Foreign currency translation
The accounts of self-sustaining foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars using the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate in effect at year-end and revenues and expenses at the average rate for the year. Gains or losses arising from the translation are deferred in a "Cumulative Translation Adjustment" account in shareholders' equity until there is a realized reduction in the investment as a result of capital transactions.
The accounts of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be integrated are translated into Canadian dollars using the temporal method. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate in effect at year-end. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses (other than amortization) are translated at the rate in effect on the transaction date or at the average rate for the year. Gains or losses arising from translation are included in income.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Foreign-denominated monetary balances are translated using the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the year, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income.
Derivative financial instruments
A significant portion of the Company's building products business is conducted in the United States. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange. Forward exchange contracts are not utilized for speculative purposes.
The foreign exchange contracts have been entered into based on the estimated net US dollar cash flow of the building products business. The Company designates foreign exchange contracts as either a hedge or as held for trading. If designated as a hedge, gains and losses related to derivatives are deferred and recognized in the same period as the corresponding hedged position. Otherwise the contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting date and any marked-to-market gains or losses are
 
GSW Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
included in the statement of operations and retained earnings as a foreign exchange gain or loss. The Company has not designated any of its foreign exchange contracts as a hedge and therefore these contracts have been marked-to-market.
Stock based compensation
The Company is authorized to grant deferred share units ("DSUs") to certain senior employees, officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. The DSUs do not entitle the participant to any right to acquire shares of the Company. Cash payouts, which are made only upon retirement, employment termination or death of the participant, are based on the number of DSUs held by the participant multiplied by the quoted market price of the Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares at that time. On each dividend payment date, participants will receive a number of additional DSUs equivalent to the number of Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares that could have been acquired on that date by notional dividend reinvestment. The value of any DSUs granted and the change in the value of the DSUs over time are accrued and included as an expense in the statement of operations and retained earnings.
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Future tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the substantively enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of Class "A" Common and Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares outstanding during the year.
Comparative figures
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the financial statement presentation adopted in the current year.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on Management's assessment of available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Areas where the nature of estimates makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include product liability reserves, insurance loss reserves, warranty and income taxes.

(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
Research and development
The Company incurred costs on activities that relate to research and development of new and existing products. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are expensed unless they meet specific criteria related to technical, market and financial feasibility. Research and development costs of $6,096 (2004 - $6,941; 2003 - $6,246) were incurred during the year. No development costs have been deferred.
Investment tax credits
Investment tax credits are accounted for using the cost reduction method whereby such credits are deducted from the expenditures or assets to which they relate when there is reasonable assurance that the investment tax credit will be received. Investment tax credits of $454 (2004 - $1,515; 2003 - $247) were received during the year. A total of $1,465 (2004  $654; 2003 - Nil) has been recognized in the accounts.
3. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
Pre-Acquisition Agreement
On February 3, 2006, the Company entered into a pre-acquisition agreement with A.O. Smith Corporation ("AOS") under which AOS will make a take-over bid to acquire all of the outstanding Class "A" Common shares and Class "B" Subordinate Voting shares of the Company for $115 per share in cash. The Company's two majority shareholders have also entered into a deposit agreement with AOS whereby they have agreed irrevocably to deposit their shares under the offer. Under the terms of the pre-acquisition agreement, AOS is required to mail a take-over circular by February 23, 2006 and take up shares under the offer by March 31, 2006, subject to certain conditions being satisfied or waived.
The Company has agreed to pay AOS a fee of $12 million if the Company enters into or consummates a competing transaction and both the Company and the two majority shareholders are released from their obligations to AOS or in certain circumstances where the pre-acquisition agreement is terminated and a financially superior transaction is consummated. The pre-acquisition agreement also provides that the Company will pay AOS expenses up to a maximum of US $5 million if AOS terminates the agreement by reason of breach by the Company of its representations, warranties and covenants.

The Class "A" shares have terms and features identical to the Class "B" shares, except that the Class "A" shares have 100 votes per share and the Class "B" shares have one vote per share. A holder of Class "A" shares may, at any time, convert them into an equal number of Class "B" shares.
The details of issued share capital are as follows:
 
During the year, the Company issued no Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares (2004  1,186 shares for $28; 2003 -1,222 shares for $25) to directors pursuant to the Directors' Share Purchase Plan.
During the year, no Class "A" Common Shares (2004 - 500; 2003 - Nil) were converted on a one-for-one basis to Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares. During January 2006, 665 Class "A" Common shares were converted on a one-for-one basis to Class "B" Subordinate Voting shares.
Executive stock option plan
Shareholders approved an Executive Stock Option Plan in 1993 pursuant to which 180,000 Class "B" Subordinate Voting Shares have been reserved for grant. No options have been issued or have been outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Dividends
The Company paid a regular dividend of $0.20 per share (2004 - $0.20; 2003 - $0.20) during the year.
10. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT
 
During 2005, the Canadian dollar gained 3.4% (2004  gained 7.9%) against the US dollar based on year-end rates. The Company has significant capital assets, marketable securities and long-term liabilities denominated in US dollars, held by self-sustaining foreign operations. As a result, the translated Canadian dollar value of these long-term assets and liabilities has been impacted. The net effect of the changes in exchange rates on the net investment in self-sustaining foreign operations during the year is reflected above as the translation adjustment during the year.

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The weighted average shares outstanding during the year used to calculate earnings per share was 3,422,329 (2004  3,421,969; 2003  3,420,574). The Company has no securities that have a dilutive impact on earnings per share.
12. UNUSUAL GAIN
 
In 2002, the Company set up a provision for the inspection and, if required, service of one type of gas water heater sold in the mid-1990s. Throughout the period of inspection and service of the affected heaters by its customers, the Company has reviewed the costs being incurred. As a result of that review, the Company determined in 2004 and in 2005 that a portion of the provision set up in 2002 would not be disbursed. In 2004 the Company reduced its provision by $1,880 and in 2005 the provision was reduced by an additional $1,042. These amounts have been recognized as an unusual item.
During the 2003 year, the Company reached a settlement of outstanding claims with component suppliers for recovery of costs incurred and expensed by the Company relating to defective water heater parts.
13. INCOME TAXES
The Company's provision for income taxes is as follows:

14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined benefit pensions
The Company has defined benefit pension plans providing pension benefits to most of AWHC's employees. For salaried employees, retirement benefits due under the defined benefit plan are based on an employee's years of service and remuneration and for hourly employees the retirement benefits are based on years of service at a prescribed annual rate. The Company measures its accrued benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for accounting purposes as at November 30 of each year. The most recent actuarial valuation was as of January 1, 2005. The next required valuation for funding purposes will be as of January 1, 2006.

(in thousands of dollars, except number of shares)
Contingencies
In the normal course of operations, the Company becomes involved in various claims and legal proceedings. While the final outcome with respect to such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of Management that adequate provisions have been made in the accounts and that the ultimate resolution of such contingencies will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company has established liabilities for environmental compliance for existing and former manufacturing facilities based upon managerial estimates, relying on currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and the professional judgment of consultants. Any change in the estimated liability based upon new information would be charged to income.
The provision for income taxes is subject to a number of different estimates made by Management. A change in these estimates could have a material effect on the effective tax rate. The Company has operations in various countries that have differing tax laws and rates. Income tax reporting is subject to audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. The effective tax rate may change from year to year based on the mix of income among the different jurisdictions in which the Company operates, changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions, changes in tax treaties between various countries in which the Company operates and changes in the estimated values of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is applied to determine the appropriate amount of income tax provision to record. Changes in the amount of the estimates required could materially increase or decrease the provision for income taxes in a period.
16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Foreign currency risk
The Company has significant operations conducted by self-sustaining subsidiaries that are located in the United States or that operate based on the US dollar. Foreign exchange gains or losses related to the Company's net investment are deferred in the Cumulative Translation Adjustment account.
Certain United States-based subsidiaries that maintain their accounts based on the US dollar are considered to be integrated. Foreign exchange gains or losses recorded on translation of their net monetary assets are included into income. As at December 31, 2005, net monetary assets are approximately US $4,600 (2004  US $5,300). These net monetary assets are expected to be utilized in the United States.
The parent company and subsidiaries located in Canada maintain their accounts in Canadian dollars. The Company's foreign currency denominated cash, accounts receivable, other assets and accounts payable balances as at December 31, 2005 were approximately US $4,400 (2004 - US $4,000). The Company's Canadian operations enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge selected identified US sales and purchases. The Company's market risk with respect to foreign exchange contracts is limited to the exchange rate differential. As at December 31, 2005, the Company had US $nil (2004  US $10,500) in foreign exchange contracts to sell US dollars. In January 2006, the Company entered into foreign exchange contracts to sell between January and October 2006 of US $5,000 at an average rate of 1.1660.

18. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ACCEPTED IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada ("Canadian GAAP"), which differ in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). The material differences impacting the Company are described below along with their effect on the consolidated financial statements.
(a)
Pension costs
US GAAP requires the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (with certain other adjustments) to be reflected as an additional minimum pension liability in the consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income.
(b)
Foreign currency translation
Canadian GAAP provides that the carrying values of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are held by self-sustaining foreign operations are revalued at current exchange rates. Gains or losses arising from the translation are deferred in the cumulative translation adjustment account in shareholders equity. US GAAP requires that the change in the cumulative translation account be recorded in other comprehensive income.
(c)
Market value adjustments
(i)
Marketable securities
Under Canadian GAAP, the Company records certain of its marketable securities at amortized costs. Premiums or discounts arising on acquisition of these marketable securities are amortized over the period to maturity. The carrying value of marketable securities is reduced to recognize a decline in value that is other than temporary. Under US GAAP, these marketable securities generally meet the definition of available for sale securities and are carried at fair value based on

quoted market prices. Changes in unrealized gains or losses and any related income tax effects are recorded as other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, net of tax and declines in value that is other than temporary, are included in the determination of income.
(ii)
Investment in Camco
Under Canadian GAAP, the investment in Camco is accounted for on a cost basis. Under the cost method, the carrying value of the investment is adjusted only when a decline in the fair value is considered to be other than temporary. Under US GAAP, the investment in Camco would be classified as available for sale securities and carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Changes in unrealized gains or losses and any related income tax effects are recorded as comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses, net of tax and a decline in value that is other than temporary, are included in the determination of income.
(d)
Comprehensive income
US GAAP requires a statement of comprehensive income, which incorporates net income and certain changes in equity. Comprehensive income is as follows:

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). They have been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and methods followed in GSW Inc.'s ("the Company") most recent audited consolidated financial statements. These unaudited consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Management has prepared these consolidated interim financial statements. The Audit, Environmental and Pension Committee of GSW Inc. approved the consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2005. The consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006 were not approved by the Audit, Environmental and Pension Committee of GSW Inc. as all the independent directors of GSW Inc. who were members of the committee resigned on April 4, 2006 upon the acquisition of GSW Inc. by A.O. Smith Enterprises Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of A.O. Smith Corporation. Ernst & Young LLP, the external auditor of GSW Inc. has not reviewed the consolidated interim financial statements.
2. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of quarterly financial statements, in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on Management's assessment of available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Areas where the nature of estimates makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include product liability reserves, insurance loss reserves, warranty and income taxes. There have been no revisions during the period to estimates previously reported that have a material impact on these consolidated interim financial statements.
3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On April 3, 2006 A.O. Smith Enterprises Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of A.O. Smith Corporation, acquired GSW Inc. by means of an offer to all shareholders of the Company as outlined in a take-over circular dated February 23, 2006.
On April 7, 2006 GSW Inc. was amalgamated with A.O. Smith Enterprises Ltd. to form A.O. Smith Enterprises Ltd.
 

Exhibit 99.3
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2006, and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the three months ended March 31, 2006 (collectively, the Pro Forma Statements) were prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition (the Acquisition) of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of GSW Inc. ("GSW") by A. O. Smith Corporation (the "Company"), as if the acquisition had occurred as of March 31, 2006 for the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and as of the beginning of the respective periods presented for the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
The Pro Forma Statements do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would actually have been if the Acquisition in fact had occurred as of the beginning of the periods indicated, or to project the Company's results of operations for any future date or period.
The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and upon certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The Pro Forma Statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company, including the notes thereto, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.
The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of $346.3 million will be allocated to the assets and liabilities of GSW based upon their respective fair values, with the remainder allocated to goodwill. For purposes of the Pro Forma Statements, such allocation has been made based upon valuations and other studies, which may be subject to adjustment. Accordingly, the allocation of purchase price included in the accompanying Pro Forma Statements is preliminary.
 
 
See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 
 
See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 
 
 Under Canadian GAAP, GSW recorded certain of its marketable securities at amortized costs. Premiums or discounts arising on acquisition of these marketable securities are amortized over the period to maturity. The carrying value of marketable securities is reduced to recognize a decline in value that is other than temporary. Under US GAAP, these marketable securities generally meet the definition of available for sale securities and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Changes in unrealized gains or losses and any related income tax effects are recorded as other comprehensive income.
Marketable securities
 US GAAP requires the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (with certain other adjustments) to be reflected as an additional minimum pension liability in the consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income.

 US GAAP requires the excess of any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (with certain other adjustments) to be reflected as an additional minimum pension liability in the consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income.
Pension liability
 Canadian GAAP provides that the carrying values of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are held by self-sustaining foreign operations are revalued at current exchange rates. Gains or losses arising from the translation are deferred in the cumulative translation adjustment account in shareholders equity. US GAAP requires that the change in the cumulative translation account be recorded in other comprehensive income.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 19, 2006
A. O. Smith announces second quarter earnings of $.81 per share on record sales of $595 million
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced second quarter 2006 net earnings of $25.1 million or $.81 per share on record sales of $594.5 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Net earnings included a previously disclosed after-tax gain of $3.2 million or $.10 per share from foreign currency transactions related to the April 2006 GSW acquisition.
Net earnings in the second quarter of 2005 were $6.5 million, or $.22 per share, which included an after-tax charge of $7.9 million or $.26 per share, primarily related to the closure of the company's Bray, Ireland motor manufacturing operation.
Revenues for the second quarter were $594.5 million including sales of $117.8 million from American Water Heater Company and GSW (businesses acquired in the GSW acquisition). Revenues for the same period in 2005 were $437.7 million.
For the first six months of 2006, A. O. Smith reported net earnings of $40.6 million or $1.31 per share on sales of $1.1 billion. Net earnings for the first six months of 2005 were $20.8 million or $.69 per share, including restructuring charges.
"Our businesses were able to generate strong results in the second quarter, achieving record sales in both businesses and significantly improved operating profits in spite of large cost increases in raw materials and energy," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented.
"In addition, we are quite pleased with the GSW acquisition and are enthused about the synergistic opportunities we will realize as we integrate the business," Jones continued.

Water Products
Second quarter sales for the water heating segment were $342.9 million compared with second quarter 2005 sales of $204.0 million. The second quarter results included sales of $117.8 million from the newly acquired American and GSW operations. Excluding the acquired businesses, sales at Water Products increased 10 percent in the quarter. The increase in sales was the result of continued strong growth in China as well as improved performance in both North American residential and commercial water heating businesses. Sales at the Nanjing, China water heater operation are more than 50 percent higher year-to-date.
As a result of the higher sales volume and the addition of the GSW businesses, operating earnings of $33.2 million were $14.4 million higher than in the second quarter of 2005. The company's operating profit margin was 9.7 percent.
Water Products completed the first major phase of the expansion of its residential water heater manufacturing facility in China during the second quarter. The project, which will eventually double the capacity of the Nanjing plant early next year, will enable Water Products to meet the increasing demand in the China residential water heater market and give it the ability to expand its marketing efforts into the "second and third tier" cities of China.
Electrical Products
Electrical Products' second quarter sales of $254.1 million were eight percent higher than second quarter 2005 sales of $234.5 million. New programs, including the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of the Yueyang Zhongmin commercial motor operation in China, as well as higher volumes in the air conditioning and distribution market segments and improved pricing to offset higher costs for raw materials, contributed to the improved sales.
Operating earnings were $16.6 million compared with $6.0 million in the second quarter of last year. Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2005 included a pre-tax charge of $7.4 million primarily related to the closure of the company's Bray, Ireland manufacturing facility.
a. o. smith announces second quarter earnings add 2
The year-over-year improvement in earnings resulted from the higher sales as well as cost savings from repositioning activities which more than offset higher costs for raw materials, freight and utilities. The company's operating profit margin was 6.5 percent in the quarter.
Other
The company is continuing to explore its strategic alternatives and has engaged consultants and placed the GSW Building Products business for sale. For accounting purposes, Building Products is reported as a discontinued operation and generated earnings of one cent per share during the second quarter. The company expects to complete the sale by the end of this year.
Outlook
A.O. Smith expects continued strength in the pre-acquisition water heater business resulting from improved residential market penetration, a stronger commercial market segment and continued strength in China. Sales in China for Water Products are expected to exceed $110 million for the full year, compared with $86 million in 2005.
At Electrical Products higher sales and profits in 2006 are expected to result from improved pricing, new programs, and the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of the Yueyang Zhongmin commercial hermetic motors business in China. In addition to the higher volume, earnings will also benefit from last year's restructuring initiatives which included the closure of the company's Bray, Ireland operation.
However, these positives will be partially offset by higher than expected steel and freight costs in the second half of the year at both of the company's base businesses as well as the acquired American and GSW operations. Accordingly, the company is maintaining its previous forecast for full year earnings of between $2.30 and $2.50 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 17, 2006
A. O. Smith announces third quarter earnings of $.55 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS-NYSE) today announced third quarter net earnings of $17.0 million or $.55 per share on sales of $564.0 million. Third quarter 2006 earnings represented a more than 70 percent increase over the $9.7 million, or $.32 per share reported in the same period last year.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $564.0 million, including sales of $118.0 million from the American Water Heater and GSW businesses acquired in April 2006, compared with $408.4 million in the third quarter of 2005.
For the first nine months of 2006, A. O. Smith reported net earnings of $57.6 million or $1.86 per share compared with net earnings of $30.5 million or $1.01 per share during the same period last year. Sales for the first nine months were $1.62 billion compared with $1.26 billion in 2005.
"We are pleased with our third quarter performance," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Strong sales in our North American water heater business, as well as continued strength in our Chinese water heater operation more than offset lower sales volume in our Electrical Products business."
Water Products
Sales in the Water Products business increased to $344.2 million compared with $199.0 million for the same period in 2005. Third quarter results included sales of $118.0 million from the American and GSW operations acquired in April of 2006. A. O. Smith's legacy Water Products business reported a 14 percent increase in third quarter sales compared with last year as both its residential and commercial businesses recorded double-digit gains. In addition, sales increased 48 percent in China.
The company believes residential sales in the Water Products' business were higher than normal as customers purchased product ahead of a September price increase implemented to offset higher costs for steel and freight. As a result, the company expects residential sales to slow for the balance of the year.
 
Operating earnings in the third quarter increased to $29.2 million over the prior year's third quarter earnings of $14.5 million. The higher operating earnings resulted from the stronger unit volumes and the addition of the American and GSW businesses.
Electrical Products
Third quarter sales in the company's motor business of $220.7 million were five percent higher than in the third quarter of last year. The higher sales reflect the fourth quarter 2005 acquisition of the Yueyang Zhongmin commercial motor operation in China as well as increased pricing implemented to offset higher costs for raw materials, primarily the substantial year-over-year increase in the cost of copper. Excluding the sales from the Yueyang acquisition and the improved pricing, sales volumes were lower than in the third quarter of 2005.
Operating earnings decreased to $8.7 million from $11.6 million as a result of the lower unit volumes.
During the third quarter the company also announced that it will close its McMinnville, Tenn., motor fabrication plant by the end of the year and outsource or relocate production to existing operations in North America.
Outlook
"We expect continued strength in both our North American commercial and Chinese water heater businesses," Jones observed.
"We are also pleased with the progress we are making with the integration of GSW and are enthused about the prospects for the combined business. However, because of near-term weakness in residential markets and continued pressure from raw material costs in both businesses, we are narrowing our 2006 forecast of earnings to between $2.30 and $2.40 per share."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, . An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated January 22, 2007.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 22, 2007
A. O. Smith announces record sales, earnings for 2006
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced record 2006 earnings of $76.5 million or $2.47 per share on record sales of $2.2 billion. Full-year operating cash flow exceeded $128 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Net earnings were 65 percent higher than the $46.5 million earned in 2005, while sales increased 28 percent over the prior year.
The company also announced record fourth quarter earnings of $18.9 million or $.61 per share on sales of $543.6 million. Fourth quarter earnings were positively impacted by a lower tax rate equal to approximately five cents per share that resulted from higher than expected foreign earnings. Net earnings were $16.0 million or $.52 per share on sales of $434.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
"We are pleased with the result we achieved in 2006 and the synergies we have recognized as a result of the GSW acquisition. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the focus and meaningful progress we have made toward margin improvement in all of our businesses," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented.
"It was a record year for Water Products with sales of $1.3 billion and operating earnings of $122 million. Operating margin was 9.7 percent. Underlying that strength was the acquisition of GSW, another strong year in China, and improved operations in North America. Although sales and operating profit increased at Electrical Products, earnings continued to be negatively impacted by higher costs for raw materials and freight," Jones continued.
"In the fourth quarter, the contribution from the GSW acquisition more than offset weaker sales and earnings in the company's legacy water heating and motor operations related to inventory builds and a slowing housing market," Jones said.
Water Products
Full-year sales of $1.3 billion at Water Products included $361 million in sales from the April 2006 acquisition of GSW. The company's legacy water heater business reported an eight percent sales increase in 2006 due to strong performance in the North American residential and commercial product lines and more than 40 percent sales growth in China.
Operating profit for the year was $122.4 million compared with $79.5 million in 2005 as a result of the higher sales volume. Operating margin was 9.7 percent compared to 9.5 percent in 2005. Consistent with the company's forecast, the acquisition of GSW generated earnings accretion of $.37 per share in 2006.
Fourth quarter sales of $342.4 million were $115 million higher than the 2005 fourth quarter, as the impact of the GSW business more than offset lower sales in the legacy business resulting from a third quarter pre-buy in the domestic residential and commercial businesses.
Operating profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $34.0 million compared with $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the addition of GSW more than offset the lost contribution from lower sales volumes in the legacy business. Operating margin in the quarter was 9.9 percent, compared with 11.2 percent in 2005. Fourth quarter 2005 operating profit included a LIFO benefit of $3 million.
Electrical Products
Full-year sales increased five percent at Electrical Products to $906 million. The sales improvement was due to improved pricing and the November 2005 acquisition of the Yueyang commercial motor business in China which more than offset lower unit volumes.
Operating profit of $48.1 million was approximately 14 percent higher than 2005 operating profit of $42.3 million. The year-over-year improvement resulted primarily from a decline in restructuring charges. Operating margin was 5.3 percent compared to 4.9 percent in 2005.
Fourth quarter sales of $201.9 million were three percent lower than the same period in 2005 as a result of the slowing housing market and high levels of inventory in the HVAC and pump motor channels.
Fourth quarter operating profit was $9.3 million, compared with $12.0 million last year. Operating margin was 4.6 percent in the quarter compared with 5.8 percent in 2005 due to the lower volumes and higher restructuring expense.
2007 Outlook
"In 2007 Water Products will benefit from the year-over-year addition of first quarter sales and earnings from the GSW acquisition and additional synergy savings," Jones observed.
"In addition, we expect to benefit from prior restructuring efforts at Electrical Products and certain strategic initiatives in both businesses. However, we are cautious about the housing slowdown as well as the potential for continued high raw material and freight costs. Accordingly, we are projecting an earnings range for 2007 of between $2.75 and $2.95 per share," Jones concluded.

On February 9, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of A. O. Smith Corporation (the "Company") approved payment of annual cash bonuses to named executive officers based on 2006 performance. The 2006 annual incentive plan for corporate executives, including Messrs. Jones, Murphy and Massa, was based on achieving a financial target, 9.8% Return on Equity, adjusted to exclude acquisitions in 2006. The annual incentive target for operating company executives, such as Messrs. Rajendra and Mapes, was based on meeting an internal financial target, Return on Performance Assets, and achieving certain strategic goals. The annual incentive opportunity for Mr. Jones as CEO and other named executive officers were set at 100% and 60% of base salary, respectively, if targets were met.
In 2006, the Company achieved 105% of the corporate bonus target and, therefore, the Committee approved the bonuses shown below for Messrs. Jones, Murphy and Massa. Mr. Rajendra exceeded his financial and strategic objectives, resulting in a bonus payment equal to 150% of his target bonus. Accordingly, the Committee approved a bonus of $298,000 and a special award of $50,000 in recognition of Mr. Rajendra's leadership in the GSW integration, with the total reflected below. Mr. Mapes achieved financial and strategic objectives that resulted in a payment equal to 79.2% of his target bonus. The Committee approved a cash bonus of $162,000, as well as a $40,000 special award for his implementation of programs to position the business for future financial success, with the total reflected below.
 
At the same meeting, the Committee approved 2007 financial and strategic objectives for the named executive officers. For corporate executive officers, including Messrs. Jones, Murphy and Massa, the Committee set a Return on Equity target. With respect to operating company executives, including Messrs. Rajendra and Mapes, the Committee approved a financial target based on an internal benchmark, Return on Performance Assets, and established certain strategic objectives. The annual incentive opportunity for Mr. Jones remains 100% of base salary, if the financial target is met. For Mr. Murphy as Chief Financial Officer, the Committee set the incentive opportunity at 67% if the target is met; for other named executive officers, it remains unchanged at 60% of base salary.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 19, 2007
. A.O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced that its board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program. The authorization allows for the purchase of up to one million shares of the company's common stock from time to time in open market transactions.
Milwaukee, Wis
During the last two years, A. O. Smith has generated more than $300 million in operating cash flow and has used that cash to pay down debt, increase dividends, make acquisitions and expand and improve its domestic and international operations.
"We believe A. O. Smith stock is a great investment, and this repurchase program will give us the ability to opportunistically acquire the stock when we believe the value warrants it," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented.
"We acquired GSW in April, 2006 and are enthused about the synergies and savings that we are generating. In addition, our Chinese water heating operation grew 40 percent last year to more than $120 million in sales and will complete a facility expansion that will more than double its capacity by the middle of this year. And strategically we developed a number of initiatives intended to more sharply focus attention on improving profitability and returns on capital in both of our businesses. For all these reasons we are very excited about the future of A. O. Smith," continued Jones.
A. O. Smith Corporation, with 2006 sales of $2.2 billion and headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis., is a diversified manufacturer serving customers worldwide. The company is one of the world's leading suppliers of water heating equipment, offering a comprehensive line featuring the best-known brands in the industry.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 18, 2007
A. O. Smith announces first quarter earnings of $.63 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced first quarter earnings of $19.5 million or $.63 per share on record sales of $577.2 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31 increased $4.0 million or $.13 per share compared with $15.5 million or $.50 per share in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2006 net earnings included an after-tax loss of approximately $3.1 million or $.10 per share from foreign currency contracts related to the GSW acquisition in April 2006. First quarter 2006 sales were $459.2 million.
"The improvement in first quarter performance resulted from the addition of GSW and a lower tax rate, which more than offset weak customer demand, primarily in the domestic residential HVAC and water heating markets," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, commented.
The decline in the company's effective tax rate resulted from the inclusion of proportionately higher income from lower taxed operations in China and Mexico.
Water Products
First quarter sales of $355.4 million reflected a $128.2 million contribution from the GSW water heater business acquired in April 2006 as well as a 36 percent or $8.7 million increase in sales in China. The company's legacy water
heater business declined slightly due to a sluggish performance in the residential market segment related to the slowdown in new housing construction.
Operating profit of $34.2 million was $8.3 million higher than the same period last year. The contribution from the GSW acquisition more than offset the modest decline in the legacy business resulting from the softer residential marketplace. Operating profit margin was 9.6 percent compared with 11.2 percent last year. The lower operating margin was due to an increase in SG&A and the additional sales of GSW, which are primarily to the lower-margin residential market.
Since 2002, the company's water heater operation in Nanjing, China, will see its sales multiply fivefold from approximately $30 million to an expected $150 million this year. The company expects to complete the second phase of its current capacity expansion by the end of May, bringing annual capacity to 1.1 million units, more than double the capacity at the inception of the project in 2005. The company recently initiated another expansion project to double its productive capacity again by the end of 2008.
Electrical Products
Sales in the electric motor business declined approximately three percent in the first quarter to $223.0 million compared with last year, primarily the result of a more than 10 percent decline in the HVAC market segment.
Asian motor sales increased more than 20 percent during the first quarter and, in connection with that growth, the company initiated plans to expand its commercial hermetic motor operation in Yueyang, acquired in November 2005.
First quarter operating profit declined to $10.2 million from $13.6 million last year. Improved pricing and repositioning savings were more than offset by the lower volume and higher costs for raw materials. First quarter operating profit margin was 4.6 percent compared with 5.9 percent last year.
2007 Outlook
 
"We continued to experience reduced demand in a number of housing-related market segments," Jones said. "And the soft markets and continued high raw material costs have overshadowed ongoing productivity improvements and cost reduction actions."
"Though we are concerned that the weak housing market may linger into the second half of the year, we remain confident we will achieve our previously announced earnings forecast for 2007 of between $2.75 and $2.95 per share," he added.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, . An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 18, 2007
A. O. Smith announces record second quarter earnings of $.87 per share; raises 2007 forecast to $2.85-$3.00 per share
Milwaukee, Wis.A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced record second quarter net earnings of $27.0 million or $.87 per share on sales of $611.5 million.
Second quarter net earnings increased nearly eight percent compared with net earnings of $25.1 million or $.81 per share in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2006 results included an after-tax gain of $3.2 million or $.10 per share on foreign currency contracts related to the April 2006 GSW acquisition. A lower tax rate in the second quarter of 2007 contributed approximately $.06 per share in year over year earnings per share growth.
Second quarter sales of $611.5 million were three percent higher than sales in the second quarter of 2006.
For the first six months of the year, the company earned $46.5 million or $1.50 per share compared with $40.6 million or $1.31 per share for the first six months of last year. Six month 2007 sales of $1.19 billion were approximately 13 percent higher than six month 2006 sales of $1.05 billion.
"Continued strength in China, improved sales in the global commercial markets, and cost reduction initiatives in both of our businesses more than offset a sluggish U.S. housing market," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, commented. "Despite the weakness in housing, our financial performance during the first half of the year was strong. Accordingly, we are increasing our 2007 earnings forecast to a range of between $2.85 and $3.00 per share."
Water Products
Second quarter sales of $354.2 million were $11.3 million or three percent higher than the same period in 2006 reflecting increased sales of commercial water heating equipment and continued strong growth in China. Revenue in the residential market segment was similar to the second quarter of 2006.
 
Operating profit of $37.0 million increased $3.8 million or 11 percent over the second quarter of 2006. The increase resulted from higher sales of better margin products. Operating profit margin was 10.4 percent compared to 9.7 percent last year.
As announced in June, the company and Fagor Electrodomesticos signed an agreement to jointly invest in a new company to manufacture residential wall-hung gas combination boilers in China. "We believe "Combi Boilers" represent a rapidly growing product category that complements and extends our residential water heating footprint in China," commented Jones. The new company will be located in Nanjing and is expected to begin production in 2008.
Electrical Products
Second quarter sales of $258.5 million were slightly higher than the second quarter of 2006. Increased sales in the company's distribution and commercial hermetic motor market segments and improved pricing more than offset lower sales to the residential hermetic, pump and home appliance motor market segments which were negatively impacted by the slow-down in U.S. residential housing construction.
Operating profit of $18.2 million was approximately ten percent higher than last year's second quarter primarily as a result of lower restructuring expense, repositioning savings and cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset the impact from a decline in units sold. Second quarter operating profit margin increased to 7.0 percent compared to 6.5 percent last year.
Sales in the company's commercial hermetic motor business in China continued to demonstrate strong growth in the second quarter as the company broke ground on a new facility for its operation in Yueyang, China. Yueyang, along with the company's operation in Suzhou, China, manufactures hermetic motors used by global manufacturers in air conditioning and refrigeration applications.
2007 Outlook
"We believe the domestic housing market will remain weak for the foreseeable future," Jones said. "And this weakness has partially offset the strength of our commercial and Chinese businesses as well as the positive impact of the company's ongoing cost reduction activities."
"Nonetheless, on the strength of our performance through the first six months of the year and continued confidence in our plan we recently announced a six percent increase in our dividend. And for the year we are narrowing and raising our earnings forecast to a range of $2.85 to $3.00 per share," Jones stated.

On October 16, 2007, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's third quarter earnings. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein. The news release furnished herewith uses a non-GAAP financial measure in forecasting 2007 earnings per share ("EPS"). Our forecasted EPS financial measure excludes certain after-tax items included in the repositioning actions announced along with the third quarter earnings, which are identified as such in the news release and this Current Report. The Company believes that this presentation of a non-GAAP measure aids investors regarding the Company's forecasted financial results.
 
On October 16, 2007, the Company announced various repositioning actions, including the closing of its Scottsville, Kentucky; Mebane, North Carolina and Budapest, Hungary electric motor production facilities. As a result, the Company expects to take an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $17 million. Approximately $8 million of the total charges are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007. The remaining charges will be recognized in 2008. The pre-tax costs expected to be incurred by the Company associated with the repositioning actions are as follows:
 
Approximately $12.1 million of the total costs are expected to be future cash expenditures payable by the Company, and the tax savings associated with the repositioning actions are estimated to be approximately $18.7 million, to be recognized primarily in the 2008 tax year.
Additional information on the repositioning plan is set forth in our news release dated October 16, 2007, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
(b) On October 15, 2007, the Company announced that Mr. Ronald E. Massa, Executive Vice President-Corporate Technology and Global Supply Chain, will retire from the Company on February 28, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 16, 2007
A. O. Smith reports third quarter earnings of $.79 per share
and announces closing of three electric motor plants
Milwaukee, Wis.A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced third quarter net earnings of $24.7 million or $.79 per share compared with $17.0 million or $.55 per share in the third quarter of 2006. Earnings in the current quarter included a tax benefit of $3.1 million or $.10 per share. Third quarter sales were $553.5 million, two percent lower than the same period in 2006.
For the first nine months of 2007 the company earned $71.2 million or $2.29 per share compared with $57.6 million or $1.86 per share in 2006. Nine-month sales were $1.74 billion, eight percent higher than nine-month sales of $1.62 billion in 2006, including the impact of GSW.
The company also announced plans to close two of its North American motor manufacturing operations as well as its motor facility in Budapest, Hungary. The company will record after-tax restructuring charges estimated to be $8 million, or $.25 per share, in the fourth quarter and $9 million, or $.30 per share, in 2008.
The company narrowed its previous earnings forecast for 2007 to $2.85$2.95 per share before the estimated $.25 per share fourth quarter charge, or $2.60$2.70 per share including the charge.
"Although we are pleased with our operating results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year, we are concerned about the outlook as we enter 2008," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
"The weaker-than-expected housing market has negatively impacted existing plant utilization rates in our residential hermetic motor businesses. Therefore, we have decided to accelerate the closing of our operations in Scottsville, Ky., and Mebane, N. C., and
are relocating production to other North American plants. In addition, we will be closing a smaller operation in Hungary and will be writing down the value of certain real estate and other assets. These decisions are consistent with our roadmap to substantially increase margins and returns in our motors business," Jones continued.
Water Products
Third quarter sales of $334.5 million declined approximately three percent compared with the third quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of lower sales in the residential market, partially offset by increased sales in other market segments including a nearly 20 percent increase in China.
Despite the lower residential volumes and higher costs for raw materials and components, operating profit of $33.6 million increased 15 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006, as a result of acquisition synergies, higher profits in China, and lower SG&A expense. Operating profit margin was 10.0 percent compared with 8.5 percent last year.
Electrical Products
Third quarter sales of $220.1 million were essentially flat compared with the same period last year. Modest increases in the distribution and commercial hermetic motor market segments offset lower volumes in the residential hermetic, pump, and home appliance market segments.
Operating profit of $12.7 million was $4 million higher than the third quarter of 2006 which included higher restructuring expense of $2.5 million. Third quarter operating profit margin was 5.8 percent.
Repositioning Actions
The company will close its operations in Scottsville, Ky., and transfer its production to its facilities in Juarez and Acua, Mexico. The residential hermetic motor manufacturing facility in Scottsville was acquired in 1998. Over the last five years, the market share of one of the company's larger customers has declined significantly and, as a result, plant utilization rates have declined in both Scottsville and Acua. These actions will appropriately resize this business segment for this market.
Consistent with the company's objective to consolidate its hermetic motor manufacturing and more fully utilize its operation in Acua, the company will also close its commercial compressor motor operation in Mebane, N. C. The transfer of work at both hermetic motor facilities will be complete by the fourth quarter of 2008.
The company will also close its motor manufacturing facility in Budapest, Hungary, and transfer the remaining production to China. It expects to complete the closing early in the first quarter of 2008.
Restructuring Charges
The company anticipates recording a fourth quarter pretax charge of approximately $13 million, or $9 million after taxes, to close the North American facilities and write down the value of other assets. The company will record an estimated charge of approximately $9 million to close the Budapest operation and receive an estimated $10 million tax benefit associated with the write-off of its investment in this operation. The combined after-tax charge is estimated to total approximately $8 million, or $.25 per share.
In 2008, the company anticipates recording an additional pretax charge of approximately $12 million to complete the closure of the North American facilities, equivalent to approximately $7 million after taxes, or $.24 per share. The expense for the North American facilities is expected to be incurred relatively evenly throughout the year.
The company will also record an additional after-tax charge of $2 million, or $.06 per share in the first quarter of 2008 to complete the closure of the Budapest facility.
"These closures represent an important element of the asset optimization initiative of our margin enhancement program. We expect to generate savings of approximately $5 million in 2008 and annual savings of $20 million beginning in 2009 from these repositioning actions. The full-year impact on operating profit is expected to add at least two hundred basis points to the 2009 operating margin at Electrical Products. As we work our way through a softer economic environment, we will continue to work diligently to enhance motor margins through our product standardization, rationalization and asset optimization programs," Jones stated.
Outlook
Throughout the year, the housing-related weakness has been more than offset by the strength in the company's commercial and Chinese businesses and the positive impact of its ongoing cost reduction activities. However, the company believes the housing slowdown will continue for the foreseeable future.
"Going forward, we believe the weakness in the housing market may be accompanied by slower growth in other market segments as we move through 2008, and although we would expect these softer markets to provide relief from high raw material costs, we expect to face historically high prices for steel and copper as we move forward," Jones continued.
"At the end of the second quarter, we issued a forecast for 2007 earnings of $2.85 to $3.00 per share. We have now narrowed our forecast for 2007 to $2.85$2.95 per share before the estimated $.25 per share fourth quarter charge," Jones concluded.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

The following exhibit is being filed herewith:
(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated January 23, 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated January 23, 2008.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 23, 2008
A. O. Smith reports record sales and earnings for 2007
 A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced record 2007 net earnings of $88.2 million or $2.85 per share on record sales of $2.3 billion. Net earnings increased 15 percent compared with $76.5 million or $2.47 per share in 2006. Earnings included after-tax restructuring and other charges of $10.1 million or $.33 per share in 2007 and $6.5 million or $.21 per share in 2006.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Sales increased seven percent over the prior year due to higher sales in China, increased sales of commercial water heaters, and a full year of the GSW business acquired in April 2006, which added $128 million in sales in the first quarter of 2007.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the company reported net earnings of $17.0 million or $.55 per share compared with earnings of $18.9 million or $.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Earnings included after-tax restructuring and other charges of $8.2 million or $.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with $2.8 million or $.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Fourth quarter sales of $570 million increased five percent over the prior year. An 11 percent increase at Water Products from higher sales in China and strong commercial water heater sales more than offset a five percent decline at Electrical Products.
"Our operating units performed well in 2007 given the difficult conditions in the housing market," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, commented. "In spite of those difficulties, we generated record sales and earnings and, as a result of a strong focus on working capital, operating cash flow of $191 million. After investing $71 million of capital in the business, we used the remaining cash flow to repay $61 million in debt, repurchase one million shares of our common stock for $37 million and pay $22 million in dividends to our shareholders," said Jones.
"We also had another strong year of growth in China contributing to an operating margin of 10.5 percent in our Water Products business, and we continued our margin-enhancement initiative in our motors business with the 2008 plant repositioning actions announced at the end of the third quarter," Jones continued.
"We remain concerned, however, with the outlook for 2008. We expect earnings to range between $2.70 and $2.90 per share, which includes approximately $.25 per share in previously announced restructuring expense for the motors business. We believe the soft housing market will continue throughout the year and will likely be accompanied by a slow-down in the commercial construction market. In addition, stubbornly high prices for steel and copper continue to pressure our businesses. All of these factors, including the restructuring in our motors business, will make 2008 a challenging year for A. O. Smith," Jones concluded.
Water Products
Water Products achieved record 2007 sales of $1.42 billion, 13 percent higher than 2006 sales of $1.26 billion. The company benefited from a full year of sales from GSW, acquired in April of 2006, increased sales of commercial water heaters, and a 25 percent increase in sales in China to approximately $150 million.
Record operating profit of $150.0 million represented a 23 percent increase over 2006. The full year of sales from the GSW acquisition, sales of higher-margin products, and growth in China more than offset lower residential water heater volume. Operating profit margin increased to 10.5 percent in 2007 from 9.7 percent last year.
Fourth quarter sales of $379.0 million increased nearly 11 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006 due to strong sales of commercial and residential wholesale product and sales growth of approximately 40 percent in China. Sales in the North American market benefited from a pre-buy related to a January 2008 price increase.
As a result of the strong sales volume, operating profit increased 33 percent to $45.1 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. The operating profit margin increased to 11.9 percent, compared with 9.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of higher sales of commercial product and the strong sales growth in China.
Electrical Products
In spite of selling price improvements to offset higher costs for raw materials and growth in the global market, sales by Electrical Products declined modestly in 2007 to $894.0 million. Unit volume sales were negatively impacted by the weak housing market, most notably in the residential hermetic and pump motor segments which more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and distribution market segments.
Operating profit for 2007 declined to $23.1 million and included pretax charges of $22.8 million, primarily associated with the planned 2008 closings of three manufacturing facilities. Operating profit was $48.1 million in 2006 and included pretax restructuring expense of $8.9 million.
Operating margin decreased to 2.6 percent compared with a 5.3 percent margin in 2006. The lower operating profit and margin were the result of higher restructuring expense and lower unit volumes.
Fourth quarter sales of $192.4 million were five percent lower than the same period in 2006 due to weakness in its residential market segments which more than offset growth in global markets.
Electrical Products recorded an $18.0 million loss in the fourth quarter, which included a $21.2 million pretax charge for restructuring. Fourth quarter operating profit in 2006 was $9.3 million and included $3.1 million for restructuring.
The lower operating profit resulted from higher raw material costs and a decline in unit volumes that more than offset improved pricing.
Electrical Products Repositioning
As announced at the end of the third quarter of 2007, the company will close its operations in Scottsville, Ky., and Mebane, N.C., and consolidate its North American hermetic motor manufacturing operations in Juarez and Acua, Mexico. The company expects the transfer of work at both hermetic motor facilities to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2008.
The company will also close its motor manufacturing facility in Budapest, Hungary, and transfer the remaining production to China. The company expects to complete the closing by the end of February 2008.
Restructuring Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the company recorded a $12.0 million pretax charge or $8.6 million after taxes associated with closing the North American facilities, including a write down of certain other assets. The company also recorded a pretax charge of $9.2 million to close the Budapest operation and a $9.9 million tax benefit associated with the write-off of its investment in that operation. In the fourth quarter the combined pretax charge was $21.2 million or $7.9 million after taxes, equivalent to $.25 per share.
During the first nine months of 2007, Electrical Products recorded pretax restructuring charges of $1.6 million, or $1.0 million after taxes equivalent to $.03 per share. For the full year, the restructuring expense at Electrical Products totaled $22.8 million before taxes or $8.9 million after taxes, equivalent to $.29 per share.
In 2008, the company expects to record an additional pretax restructuring charge of approximately $13.2 million associated with the above-mentioned facilities, equivalent to $7.9 million after taxes, or approximately $.25 per share. The expense is expected to be incurred relatively evenly throughout 2008.
"These closures represent an important element of the asset optimization initiative of our margin enhancement program," Jones said. "We expect to generate savings of approximately $5 million in the second half of 2008 and annual savings of $20 million beginning in 2009 from these repositioning actions. The full-year impact on operating profit is expected to add at least two hundred basis points to the 2009 operating margin at Electrical Products. As we work our way through a softer economic environment, we will continue to work diligently to enhance motor margins through our product standardization, rationalization and asset optimization programs," Jones continued.
Outlook
"We are forecasting lower unit sales in our residential businesses in 2008. Furthermore, we believe the weakness in construction could broaden and negatively affect our commercial businesses later in the year. Accordingly, we are projecting commercial sales to be flat to down in the North American market for the full year. On a more positive note, we expect our businesses in China to continue to generate favorable results in the coming year," Jones continued.
"In the face of these market challenges, as evidenced by the actions we are taking in our motor business, our operating units are working diligently to reduce costs and better position operations for market adversity. As a result of our cautious outlook for the year, we expect A. O. Smith to earn between $2.70 and $2.90 per share in 2008, which includes restructuring expense of approximately $.25 per share," Jones concluded.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Smith Investment Company proposes restructuring of holdings in A. O. Smith Corporation
        Smith Investment Company (SMIC  PK) announced today that it has made a proposal to restructure its holdings in A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  NYSE). The proposed transaction would result in the shareholders of Smith Investment having direct ownership of the same number and type of A. O. Smith shares currently held by Smith Investment. Smith Investment's common stock has been valued at a significant discount to the underlying value of the A. O. Smith shares held by Smith Investment. The proposed transaction is intended to allow Smith Investment's shareholders to realize the underlying value of Smith Investment's holdings in A. O. Smith and provide enhanced liquidity to Smith Investment's shareholders.
Milwaukee, Wis. 
        Pursuant to the proposed transaction, Smith Investment would be merged with a newly formed subsidiary of A. O. Smith. In the merger, Smith Investment's common stock would be exchanged for newly issued shares of A. O. Smith's class A common stock and common stock. It is intended that this exchange would be non-taxable to the shareholders of Smith Investment. Because the total number and type of A. O. Smith shares issued in the proposed transaction would equal the number and type of A. O. Smith shares currently held by Smith Investment, there would be no net change to the number of outstanding A. O. Smith shares. Prior to the merger, Smith Investment intends to distribute in a taxable transaction substantially all of its assets (other than its holdings in A. O. Smith) to the shareholders of Smith Investment. The proposal also contemplates that, prior to the merger, substantially all of Smith Investment's pre-closing liabilities would be discharged or assumed by the entity or entities in which Smith Investment's distributed assets are held.
        A special committee comprised of two independent directors from Smith Investment's board of directors recommended the making of the proposal. The Smith Investment special committee was formed to consider possible transactions on behalf of the shareholders of Smith Investment other than certain members of the Smith family and trusts for the benefit of certain members of the Smith family. The Smith Investment special committee has engaged independent financial and legal advisors to assist it in completing its review. Smith Investment's board of directors has agreed that it will not approve any transaction without the prior recommendation of the Smith Investment special committee.
        Before recommending the proposal, the Smith Investment special committee consulted with certain Smith Investment shareholders holding in the aggregate a majority of Smith Investment's common stock. These shareholders separately indicated to the Smith Investment special committee that they would support a transaction on substantially the terms proposed. These shareholders also separately indicated to the Smith Investment special committee that they would not support any alternative transaction that resulted in a sale of Smith Investment or otherwise eliminated or limited the dual class voting structure at A. O. Smith.
        Smith Investment indicated that the proposal is preliminary, and remains subject to negotiation of definitive documentation and approval of the Smith Investment special committee and board of directors. The proposal also requires the approval of the A. O. Smith board of directors. A. O. Smith has not yet had an opportunity to respond to the proposal. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction or any other transaction will result from the proposal. Except if required by applicable law, Smith Investment does not intend to comment further on the proposal unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a proposed transaction has been reached.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 17, 2008
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
April 17, 2008
A. O. Smith reports first quarter earnings of $.72 per share;
revises 2008 forecast to $2.60 - $2.80 per share
 A. O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) today reported first quarter earnings of $21.9 million or $.72 per share on sales of $571.4 million. Earnings included an after-tax charge of approximately $2.7 million or $.09 per share associated with restructuring in its Electrical Products business. First quarter sales were one percent lower than last year's first quarter.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Net earnings increased approximately 12 percent over the $19.5 million or $.63 per share earned during the same period in 2007. First quarter 2007 earnings included an after-tax restructuring charge of $.7 million or $.02 per share.
"We reported higher earnings from continued strength in foreign operations, particularly China, as well as productivity and margin enhancement initiatives, in spite of the economic downturn and sharply rising costs for steel and copper," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, commented.
"But we are concerned about the dramatic rise in raw material costs and the prospect that they may persist for the remainder of the year. As a result, we will look to our customers to absorb the impact of these increases," Jones continued.
"In addition, the slowdown in nonresidential construction we previously forecast for later in the year has already begun. Accordingly, we are lowering our 2008 earnings forecast to $2.60 to $2.80 per share from the previous estimate of between $2.70 and $2.90 per share," Jones said.
Water Products Company
Sales of $352.1 million in the Water Products business were slightly lower than sales of $355.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Sales growth in China of more than 40 percent and improved pricing related to higher steel costs were more than offset by significantly lower residential unit volumes.
Operating profit of $35.9 million was five percent higher than the same period in 2007 as a result of the growth in China and cost reduction initiatives. Operating profit margin increased to 10.2 percent in the first quarter from 9.6 percent last year.
Electrical Products Company
Electrical Products reported sales of $220.5 million, slightly lower than in the first quarter of 2007. Higher sales in China and improved pricing related to higher raw material costs were more than offset by weakness in the residential market segment.
Operating profit increased to $11.1 million compared with $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2007. Pretax restructuring charges of $3.8 million and $1.2 million were included in the first quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The improved operating profit in the first quarter of 2008 was the result of ongoing margin improvement initiatives including repositioning savings which were partially offset by lower unit volumes. Operating profit margin improved to 5.0 percent from 4.6 percent last year.
Outlook
"The domestic housing market remains very weak and its outlook uncertain. We believe the bottom in the new housing construction market may not arrive until sometime next year. Furthermore, the decline in the nonresidential market we previously forecast has already begun and may be steeper in 2008 than originally projected," Jones said.
"More troublesome is the escalation of raw material costs. Steel prices rose sharply during the first quarter and are projected to remain at record levels for the remainder of the year," Jones continued.
"We have been working diligently to offset these cost increases with productivity and margin enhancement initiatives. In addition to those efforts we initiated a voluntary salaried workforce reduction in March. We believe these initiatives will help mitigate the cost headwinds. However, because of all the uncertainties in the economic environment, we have decided to lower our forecast for 2008 to $2.60 to $2.80 per share compared with our previous earnings forecast of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. This estimate includes restructuring expense of approximately $.25 per share," Jones concluded.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

On July 17, 2008, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's second quarter earnings. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.

(99.1)    News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated July 17, 2008.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated July 17, 2008
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
July 17, 2008
A. O. Smith reports record second quarter earnings of $1.06 per share; increases 2008 forecast to $2.70 - $2.85 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced that second quarter earnings increased eighteen percent over second quarter 2007 results to $31.9 million while earnings per share increased twenty two percent to $1.06. Reported earnings in the quarter included a net benefit of $0.03 per share resulting from a cumulative currency translation gain related to the closure of the company's operation in Budapest.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were $622.2 million, slightly higher than second quarter 2007 sales of $611.5 million.
"Our operating units are performing well in the most difficult economy in recent memory," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, commented. "Operating margins in both businesses exceeded nine percent and we remain confident in our ability to manage the challenges associated with the weak housing market and relentlessly high raw material and energy prices. Because of that confidence and the strong performance in the second quarter, we have increased and narrowed our 2008 earnings forecast to $2.70 to $2.85 per share from our previous estimate of $2.60 to $2.80 per share."
For the first six months of 2008, A.O. Smith earned $53.8 million or $1.78 per share on sales of $1.19 billion. For the same period in 2007, the company earned $46.5 million or $1.50 per share on similar sales volume.
Water Products Company
Second quarter sales in the company's Water Products operation were $380.8 million, eight percent higher than the second quarter of 2007. Continued record-setting performance in China, strong sales of commercial product, and pricing actions related to higher costs for steel more than offset softness in the residential water heater market.
 
Sales in China of approximately $51 million in the Water Products segment increased more than thirty percent in the second quarter and are almost forty percent higher year-to-date. The company's Chinese business is benefiting from increased unit volume and favorable currency adjustments. The current plant expansion project, to double capacity in Nanjing by the end of 2009, remains on schedule.
Water Products' second quarter operating earnings were $36.3 million, slightly lower than the second quarter of 2007. Lower residential volumes and higher steel costs more than offset the strong growth in China, the higher sales of commercial product, and the impact from pricing actions. Operating profit margin declined to 9.5 percent from 10.4 percent last year.
As part of its strategy to extend its rapid growth in Asia, A. O. Smith began marketing residential water heaters in India during the second quarter, introducing glass-lined products specifically designed for consumers in that large and fast growing market. The company expects to begin manufacturing in Bangalore, India in 2010.
Electrical Products Company
Second quarter 2008 sales of $242.4 million at Electrical Products declined six percent compared with the same period last year. A sharp decline in unit volumes related to the soft housing market more than offset pricing actions related to higher costs for steel and copper.
Second quarter operating profit of $22.5 million increased twenty four percent compared with the second quarter of 2007. The increase in the seasonally strong operating profit resulted from improved commercial terms, including pricing, as well as favorable manufacturing cost absorption and ongoing cost reduction activities.
Operating profit margin was 9.3 percent compared to 7.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007.
The company's margin enhancement program, including product standardization and asset optimization initiatives, continued to gain traction during the quarter. Electrical Products' repositioning program remains on schedule and it anticipates related cost savings of $5 million in 2008 and annual savings of $20 million in 2009.
Outlook
"Our operating units are performing well in a very difficult environment, facing soft markets and record raw material costs. The performance during the first half of this year is a reflection of our ability to operate our plants efficiently, focus on cost containment, and recover increased raw material costs from our customers," Jones commented.
 
"However, we expect to experience the full impact of sharply elevated steel costs during the second half of the year," Jones continued. "That, combined with protracted weakness in the housing market, and the likelihood of weaker commercial construction, will make the next six months particularly challenging. Because of sharply higher raw material costs, we expect third quarter earnings to be significantly lower than the record $0.79 per share earned in the third quarter of 2007, which included a nonrecurring tax benefit of ten cents per share."
"Having said that, we are increasing and narrowing our full year 2008 earnings forecast to $2.70 to $2.85 per share from our previous estimate of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, to reflect our strong performance during the first half of 2008. This estimate continues to include approximately $0.25 per share of expense related to restructuring in our Electrical Products business," Jones concluded.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated October 16, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
October 16, 2008
A. O. Smith announces third quarter earnings of $0.70 per share;
increases and narrows 2008 guidance to $2.80 to $2.90 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced third quarter earnings of $21.4 million or $0.70 per share on revenue of $602.7 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.70 compared with $0.79 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter 2007 earnings included a non-recurring tax benefit of $3.1 million or $0.10 per share.
"In the third quarter, we continued to see strength from our commercial and Chinese businesses in spite of the very difficult conditions in the broader economy," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Also, we generated more than $55 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and reduced our leverage ratio to less than 30 percent of our capital."
"Based on our strong performance in the third quarter and the confidence in our operating units' ability to manage costs in spite of market volatility, we increased and narrowed our 2008 guidance from our previous estimate of $2.70 to $2.85 per share to earnings of between $2.80 and $2.90 per share."
For the first nine months of 2008, the company earned $75.2 million or $2.48 per share on sales of $1.80 billion. For the same nine-month period in 2007, the company earned $71.2 million or $2.29 per share on sales of $1.74 billion.
Water Products Company
Third quarter 2008 sales of $372.1 million in the Water Products business were approximately 11 percent higher than in the third quarter of last year. Strong sales of commercial water heaters, continued growth in China, and pricing actions related to higher steel costs more than offset continued weakness in the residential market segment.
 
Sales in China increased approximately 26 percent to $44.1 million in the third quarter compared with last year. The company's plant expansion project in Nanjing, which will more than double residential water heater capacity by the end of 2009, remains on schedule.
Third quarter operating earnings for the Water Products business of $32.8 million were slightly lower than the third quarter of last year. Lower residential volumes and higher steel costs more than offset the higher sales of commercial product and the impact from pricing actions. Operating profit margin declined to 8.8 percent from 10 percent last year.
Electrical Products Company
Electrical Products Company's third quarter sales were $231.9 million, compared with $220.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. Higher global sales of commercial product and improved pricing related to raw material cost increases helped to offset lower motor volumes in housing-related markets.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $10.7 million and included $2.1 million in charges for restructuring activities. Operating earnings were $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. Operating margins declined from 5.8 percent last year to 4.6 percent this year as a result of restructuring activities and lower volumes.
Electrical Products' repositioning program remains on schedule, and the company expects to close the Mebane, N.C. and Scottsville, Ky. plants by the end of this year, as previously announced. The company anticipates cost savings of $5 million in 2008 and annual savings of $20 million beginning in 2009.
Outlook
"Because of our strong performance in the third quarter, and despite the difficult economic environment we are facing in the fourth quarter, we have increased and narrowed our 2008 earnings guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90 per share from our previous estimate of $2.70 to $2.85 per share. This estimate includes the approximately $0.25 per share of expense related to restructuring in our Electrical Products unit," Jones pointed out. "We are very pleased with the flexibility our management teams have demonstrated to manage through these unprecedented economic times. However, we face headwinds going forward, including lower commercial volumes and higher raw material costs that are being only partially recovered. Finally, the uncertainty with regard to the economy's stability continues to cloud our visibility."
 
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

The holder of such Company Certificate, upon its delivery thereof to the Exchange Agent, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i). Company Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled as of the Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such Company Certificate, following the Effective Time, shall represent for all purposes only the right
 
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Company Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Company Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2.
(c) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, issuable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Escrow Shares.

(d) In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Merger Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if any certificate for the applicable Merger Consideration is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate or Company Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of such shares of Company Merger Stock, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock.

The Surviving Entity and Parent hereby agree to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent to, remit any such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Escrow Agent and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration and such other amounts payable under Section 2.2(c) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the holder of the shares of Company Merger Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Escrow Agent.
(h) Any portion of the certificates evidencing the Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Common Stock, the cash to be paid in respect of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i), and the cash or other property in respect of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Merger Stock for a period of time longer than twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company Merger Stock for the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to the time of demand shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, and payment of any cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Common Stock to which they were entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without interest.
(i) No certificates representing a fractional share of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for shares of Company Merger Stock upon the surrender for exchange of a Company Certificate. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Company Merger Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Company Certificates for exchange (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 2.2(j)) shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into account and aggregating shares of Parent Class A Common Stock represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder and separately taking into account and aggregating shares of Parent Common Stock represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, to which such holder (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the Closing Market Price (it being understood that such Closing Market Price shall also be used with respect to any fractional share of Parent Class A Common Stock). In addition, in lieu of the release of any fractional Escrow Share pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Merger Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of an Escrow Share (and after taking into account and aggregating any fractional Escrow Shares to
 
which such holder would otherwise be entitled) shall be paid at such time as the fractional Escrow Share would otherwise have been released to such holder pursuant to the Escrow Agreement a cash payment (without interest) from Parent in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest of an Escrow Share (and after taking into account and aggregating any fractional Escrow Shares to which such holder would otherwise be entitled) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (b) the Closing Market Price. Upon payment by Parent for any fractional Escrow Share, such fractional Escrow Share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.
(j) In the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article II in respect of the shares of Company Merger Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates.
2.3 . Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto (the "") with an escrow agent (the "") reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent.

Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid the Merger Consideration by the Surviving Entity as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided by the Dissenters' Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Smith Investment Company, a Nevada corporation (""), Smith Investment Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""), A. O. Smith Corporation (the ""), and SICO Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (""), are parties to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived from time to time, the ""), providing for, among other things, the merger of SICO with and into Merger Sub (the ""), in which all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of SICO held by the shareholders of SICO are being converted into a right to receive shares of Class A common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company ("") and shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (""; and together with the Class A Common Stock, the ""). Capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this support agreement ("") will have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

Support Agreement
As a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into and perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, the Company has required that SICO enter into this Support Agreement. SICO is further entering into this Support Agreement to express its support for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. SICO represents and warrants that annexed hereto sets forth as of the date hereof the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned beneficially or of record by SICO (the "Covered Shares"). SICO represents and warrants that, as of the date hereof and except as disclosed on annexed hereto, SICO owns the Covered Shares free and
Schedule I
Schedule II
clear of all liens, charges, encumbrances, voting agreements and commitments of every kind. As of the date of this Support Agreement, except as expressly permitted or provided in this Support Agreement or the Merger Agreement and except as disclosed on annexed hereto, SICO has sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to all of the Covered Shares. SICO agrees, while this Support Agreement is in effect, to promptly notify the Company of the number of any new shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which SICO acquires beneficial or record ownership. Any such shares shall automatically become Covered Shares and subject to the terms of this Support Agreement as though owned by SICO as of the date hereof.
Schedule II
2. SICO has all necessary legal capacity, power and authority to execute and enter into this Support Agreement, and this Support Agreement is the legally valid and binding agreement of SICO, and is enforceable against SICO in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
3. SICO agrees that, during the term of this Support Agreement, it will not, and will not agree to, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Covered Shares, or any interest therein, or otherwise enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance of other disposition of, or limitation on the voting rights of, any of the Covered Shares (any such action a "Transfer"); provided however, that nothing herein shall prevent SICO from consummating a Transfer (i) as specifically required by a court order, which SICO shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid, (ii) pursuant to this Support Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the transactions and other agreements contemplated thereby, or (iii) with the Company's prior written consent. Any action taken in violation of the foregoing sentence shall be null and void ab initio and SICO agrees that any such prohibited action may and should be enjoined. If any involuntary Transfer of any of the Covered Shares shall occur, the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold the Covered Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Support Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until valid termination of this Support Agreement.
4. SICO agrees that, during the term of this Support Agreement, at any meeting of shareholders of the Company, however called, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, SICO shall be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or cause to be voted) all of the Covered Shares (1) in favor of (a) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger Agreement and (b) any other matter that is on the ballot in furtherance of or for the purpose of facilitating the Merger, including any matter that is required by law or regulatory authority to be approved by the stockholders of the Company to facilitate the Merger or any transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (2) against any proposal that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.
5. SICO hereby agrees not to commence or participate in, and agrees to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to any claim, derivative or otherwise, against the Company, Merger Sub, or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Support Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including any claim (a) challenging the validity
 
of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Support Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (b) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of any officers or directors of the Company or Merger Sub in connection with this Support Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, including the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this Paragraph 5 shall not preclude SICO from being a party to any litigation between or among the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, SpinCo, the Shareholders' Representative, any Smith Family Member or any other Former Company Shareholder concerning any provision of the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or to resolve any dispute regarding any provision of the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.
6. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Support Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Support Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Support Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.
7. Each of the parties hereto recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by SICO of any covenants or agreements contained in this Support Agreement will cause the Company to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore each of the parties hereto agrees that in the event of any such breach the Company shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.
8. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the obligations of SICO set forth in this Support Agreement shall not be effective or binding until after such time as the Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by the Company, Merger Sub, SpinCo and SICO. This Support Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the Parent Recommendation having been withdrawn or modified in a manner that would permit SICO to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (c) the Effective Time. Upon such termination, this Support Agreement shall immediately become void, there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of SICO and all rights and obligations of the parties to this Support Agreement shall cease, in all cases so long as SICO is not in breach of its covenants or agreements under this Support Agreement; provided, however, that Paragraphs 5 through 14 hereof shall survive termination of this Support Agreement (it being understood that Section 7 shall survive solely to the extent necessary to effect the provisions of Section 5).
9. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to the other parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given on the next business day after the same is sent, if delivered personally or sent by telecopy or overnight delivery, or three calendar days after the same is sent, if sent by registered or certified

Exhibit 99.1
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE: AOS) and its largest stockholder, Smith Investment Company (PK: SMIC), announced today that they have signed a definitive merger agreement providing for Smith Investment to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of A. O. Smith in a tax free exchange. As a result of the merger, the stockholders of Smith Investment will own shares of A. O. Smith directly, rather than through Smith Investment. Stockholders of Smith Investment will be entitled to receive 2.396 shares of A. O. Smith Class A Common Stock and .463 shares of A. O. Smith Common Stock for each share of Smith Investment stock they hold.
Smith Investment owns approximately 97.9% of the outstanding A. O. Smith Class A Common Stock and approximately 7.1% of the outstanding A. O. Smith Common Stock. Historically, Smith Investment's stock has traded at a significant discount to the underlying value of its A. O. Smith shares. The merger is intended to allow the Smith Investment stockholders to realize the underlying value of the A. O. Smith shares held by Smith Investment, and provide enhanced liquidity for Smith Investment stockholders.
A. O. Smith and its stockholders are expected to benefit from the transaction because its terms provide for:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A majority of Smith Investment's outstanding stock is owned by members of the Smith family, which is the founding family of A. O. Smith. To address any potential conflicts of interest, each of A. O. Smith and Smith Investment appointed a special committee of independent directors to negotiate the transaction. After receiving the favorable recommendation of their respective special committees, the board of directors of each of A. O. Smith and Smith Investment approved the terms of the proposed merger.
Certain members of the Smith Family have agreed to vote their shares to approve the merger agreement at a meeting of Smith Investment stockholders. Similarly, Smith Investment has agreed to vote its shares to approve the merger agreement at a meeting of A. O. Smith stockholders. These stockholders have enough votes to ensure approval of the transaction at the respective meetings of A. O. Smith and Smith Investment.
Certain members of the Smith family have indicated that they intend to act together with respect to their interests in A. O. Smith after the merger, and will deposit the A. O. Smith shares they receive in the merger into a voting trust. These Smith family members have expressed their desire to continue their long-standing and strong commitment to the growth and prosperity of A. O. Smith. To obtain A. O. Smith's approval for these arrangements, these members of the Smith family have agreed to refrain for up to three years after completion of the merger from taking certain actions with respect to A. O. Smith, such as proposing to acquire A. O. Smith, without the prior approval of the A. O. Smith board.
In addition to receipt of the A. O. Smith and Smith Investment stockholder approval, the merger is subject to receipt of a favorable letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the effectiveness of an A. O. Smith registration statement covering the shares to be issued to the Smith Investment stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, Smith Investment will reimburse A. O. Smith for substantially all of its transaction-related expenses. In addition, a portion of A. O. Smith Common Stock to be issued to the Smith Investment stockholders will be placed in escrow to satisfy indemnification claims, if any, by A. O. Smith in connection with the transaction. The companies expect the merger to close in the second quarter of 2009.
To facilitate the merger, Smith Investment will distribute to the stockholders of Smith Investment, in a taxable spin-off transaction, all of Smith Investment's assets and liabilities, other than its shares of A. O. Smith. The Smith Investment assets to be distributed include Smith Investment's operating businesses. Smith Investment will first contribute these assets and liabilities to a newly formed limited liability company, Smith Investment Company LLC, and the Smith Investment stockholders will receive membership units in Smith Investment Company LLC in the spin-off transaction. Smith Investment has established December 22, 2008 as the record date for determining the Smith Investment stockholders entitled to participate in the spin-off transaction, and the spin-off transaction will be effective January 1, 2009. The spin-off transaction is not conditioned upon completion of the merger.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated served as financial advisor for the special committee of the board of directors of A. O. Smith, and Duff & Phelps, LLC served as financial advisor for the special committee of the board of directors of Smith Investment.

Exhibit 99.1
December 10, 2008
A. O. Smith reduces forecast for the fourth quarter 2008
Milwaukee, WI - A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE: AOS) today indicated it expects fourth quarter results will be weaker than expected due to sluggish demand in both its water heater and electric motor businesses. As a result, the previously communicated 2008 forecast of $2.80 to $2.90 per share will likely not be achieved.
A decline in global construction and consumer spending, intensified by inventory reductions by the company's customers, has resulted in a significant drop in order volumes during the fourth quarter. The company responded with a decision to mitigate its inventory build throughout the quarter and aggressively curtailed production.
"The speed with which the market downturn confronted us is unprecedented," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "However, with current orders less than historical replacement demand levels, we expect inventories will likely be replenished in early 2009."
"We are taking actions to further reduce costs and conserve cash in response to the market challenges. We are scrutinizing capital expenditures, maximizing working capital and reducing production schedules. We believe our financial strength gives us an advantage to navigate these challenging times."
The company now expects fourth quarter earnings to be between $.15 and $.25 per share. For the year, it expects earnings per share to be between $2.63 and $2.73.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 11:00 am (Eastern Time) today to discuss the fourth quarter forecast as well as other matters. The call can be heard on the company's website, .

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the A. O. Smith Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode; later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, the Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Patricia Ackerman. Ms. Ackerman, please go ahead.
Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you Reggie. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this conference call. With me this morning, participating in the call are Paul Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Terry Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Ajita Rajendra, President of our Water Products Company; Chris Mapes, President of our Electrical Products Company; Jim Stern, General Counsel; John Kita, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Craig Watson, Vice President, Business Development.
 
Before we begin with Paul's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release and last evening's press release. Paul?
Paul W. Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay, thank you, Pat. And good morning ladies and gentlemen, as you probably heard, we're advantage of having all hands here today on having a planning session, so we've got everybody sitting in on this call from  not everybody, but most of our leadership team.
We've issued two press releases in the last 24-hours, and this morning we'll elaborate on both of them. Today, we issued a press release announcing a reduction in our fourth quarter estimate to be between $0.15 and $0.25 per share compared with $0.32 and $0.42 per share, implied by our previous guidance. Full-year earnings are now estimated to be between $2.63 and $2.73 per share. As a result, we're now expecting cash flow from operations to be approximately $140 million.
Our fourth quarter of this year started off okay, with our October order volumes coming in as expected. However, in November we saw our orders drop substantially. The volume drop is caused not only by consumers retrenching in reaction to the credit crisis, but also prudent management of inventory levels across our entire distribution channel. Our current order levels in water heaters are below historic replacement levels, indicating inventory contraction by our customers.
Our Chinese businesses are now being impacted by the global recession and their growth rates are slowing. The good news here is that we should benefit from the $560 billion government stimulus package, as the majority of our products made in China are used domestically.
One phenomenon that those of you who have followed our story for a few years are familiar with is the December pre-buy. This year, with no announced price increase for January of 2009, we do not expect to have a pre-buy in December of this year. Also, you might be interested to know that most of our HAC OEM customers have shut down their production until January just to manage their own inventories.
We're responding to this challenging market first and foremost by conserving cash and reducing working capital. We have efforts in place to watch receivables with an eagle eye for credit issues and to aggressively police slow paying customers. We're watching key suppliers for signs of credit problems. Our plants are on high alert to stay in sync with customer production schedules and demand which, as we've already mentioned, have been abruptly changing within this market.
As a reminder, we are a short cycle business with minimal backlog. Most orders are shipped within five days. We decided to curtail production in lieu of building inventory in the fourth quarter. And we have expanded holiday shut downs and will continue to make adjustments if necessary.
 
As has been the case for some time, we're closely managing discretionary spending until we have more clarity on future order volumes. At the same time, the benefits of restructuring activities at Electrical Products Company are on track, and both operating units are aggressively continuing productivity programs that are delivering results. We are prudently navigating our acquisition pipeline and proceeding with expansion plans in China and India. Finally, we recognize that our strong balance sheet provides us with a competitive advantage in this tumultuous marketplace.
2009 will be challenging, no doubt about it. But we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Negotiations on the annual contracts with our largest retail customers are right around the corner. The closure of two motor plants in the U.S. and one in Europe during 2008 is expected to benefit our results incrementally by $15 million in 2009. And our China businesses should benefit from the $560 billion government stimulus package already announced.
Finally, we continue to leverage our financial strength and have not cut-off key product development initiatives worldwide. Current forecasts now indicate that housing completions will not bottom until the fourth quarter of 2009, and no one has clear visibility to call the end of the global recession.
Our commercial volumes in China demand are now starting to show signs of weakness. 2009 looks like it will be a difficult year to forecast. But consistent with prior years, we will indicate our forecasted earnings range during our investor conference call in late January.
And now, let's talk about the SICO announcement. We are pleased that the transaction with Smith Investment Company was announced yesterday and proud of the milestone in our history that it represents. The benefits to our shareholders are numerous. Let me cover just a few. One, the number of shares of A.O. Smith exchanged for the underlying shares owned by Smith Investment Company will be the discount, resulting in a small shrinkage in the total shares outstanding.
Second, the transaction will result in several corporate governance enhancements, including one more Board seat elected by common stock shareholders, a sunset provision on Class A shares, based on the percentage of ownership, and a requirement the Class A shares automatically convert to common shares upon transfer to unaffiliated third-parties.
And third, the number of shares of A.O. Smith available to potentially trade in the public market will increase materially. And essentially, all costs associated with the merger will be paid by Smith Investment Company. This transaction has been a long process in the making and we are pleased with the outcome.
The process going forward includes an IRS ruling, an SEC review, and shareholder votes by both entities. But we are confident that it will go smoothly. We plan to put the merger in front of our shareholders for a vote at our annual meeting in April of next year and close shortly thereafter.
 
That's all we have for our prepared comments, just a reminder that we will report fourth quarter results on Thursday, January 22 and we'll host a conference call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time that morning.
That completes our prepared remarks and we are now ready for your questions. So I'll turn it back over to Reggie.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go now to the line of Paul Mammola with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Hi, good morning guys.
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
Good morning, Paul.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Can you give us a sense as to how water is tracking versus motors? I would assume motors is the leading decliner in terms of revenue; is water far behind there? Can you give us a sense of that?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
You're right. We've seen a little bit smaller  a larger decline on the motor side. You know, in total what we did in November as we looked at this it took about $50 million out of our revenue projection over the November, December time period. We haven't lost the customer; this is strictly the customers we've got, just ordering less. Frankly, it's not helping us right now obviously, but the good news is we're not going to go into next year with an inventory bubble. So we're going to be monitoring the order rates as we always do, but monitoring them very closely and at the end of December and going into January. But, yeah, the larger volume decline was in motors.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay, that's helpful. And then could you categorize how much cost inflation played in the 4Q forecast?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
We already had that in, but, yeah, we do our  I'll talk about steel as an example. It's done off of trailing CRU indices, and if you go back and look at the third quarter, those were sky-high. So we obviously have a pretty significant steel cost this quarter to overcome that will decline going forward, obviously, given what's happened to steel costs.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then you mentioned renegotiations with retail customers. Do you think there is room for price improvement there, maybe in the first quarter?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
That's per contract that we have that window open and I'm not going to comment on how that might come out.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay, fair enough. And then finally on the SICO, am I correct to assume that there are no assets or liabilities to be assumed by you guys, once  or potentially, if this is completed?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
That's correct.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Okay. Thanks for your time.
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
Thank you.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go now to the line of Scott Graham with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
Hey, good morning.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Good morning, Scott.
<A  Paul Jones>:
I just want to ask a little bit more, Paul, about what you see going on in China. Are your customers there telling you that this is just maybe more of a shock to the system and that maybe, you know, volumes return because I know that you guys were kind of looking at sort of mid-high teens growth in that market right now and obviously we've got to temper that down a little bit, but what's the underlying trend line there, because clearly with government stimulus there possibly offsetting some of the GDP, the slower GDP, although I think we would all sign up for China's GDP any moment. What is really underneath those numbers do you think? And if you could maybe tell us what you're thinking on 09, incrementally?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Okay. I'll try to comment. Some of this is going to be personal opinion, but I think it's what you asked for. The slow down  China is still growing and I agree with you, I'd love for the North America to have their GDP numbers next year, whatever they're going to be. But they have a bit of a housing bubble. A lot of speculators got into the housing market and in my opinion there is just a lot of inventory there to be sold. Part of the government stimulus package is housing related. So where we've just seen a slowing, I personally don't think it's going to last for a long period of time, maybe a few months at most. Again it's slowing of the growth rate. So it's not anything like we're seeing in the U.S. where we're seeing declines.
<A  Paul Jones>:
But that's, you know, we're obviously still bullish on China, we've got  we've not slowed down on any of our product development activities there. We're not slowing down on any of the initiatives we have relative to some potential acquisitions there. We're still moving forward; that's one area that we have not done any cutting back at all.
Okay. That's helpful. Would you also may be unbundle for us a little bit some of the things that you're doing in electrical products. I guess, my understanding was that maybe that there were some things, particularly some of the manufacturing, let's call it relocations or maybe in this case locations of SKUs that may be you were looking to jettison, what have you, that that was maybe slowing things down somewhat. Maybe if you wouldn't mind, Paul, going through not the plant closure stuff, the asset optimization, that's clearly on track. But the other two elements of the EP cost enhancement  cost reduction?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Yes, the roadmap to profitability, those projects are still going on, the standardization as well as the customer and product optimization projects. The lean initiatives  our lean initiative has a wide definition; primarily means reducing and taking costs out of the current designs. Those projects have been on schedule or ahead of schedule since we began them more than two years ago. I could not be more happy with how those teams are doing it.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Our margins are going up in Electrical Products this year. It's our projection that that will continue for the next several years, based on these efforts. And again, we may have little a more color on that in January. It's unfortunate that the economy's not helping us out there so that more of what they've done has been visible  will be more visible; but the results are there and they're going to show up.
I guess I was  maybe a little bit more specifically Paul, there was some of the SKUs and business that maybe you wanted to walk away from. Maybe the ability to do that is happening a little bit more slowly than what you had hoped, based on the way production is dispersed for those same SKUs.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
No, it's not happening slower. We're still going to have a volume decline there even though I think the revenues will probably be up because of the price increases we've had to get this year because of raw materials.
<A  Paul Jones>:
But we are still eliminating business that is not good for our shareholders and we're still not quoting on business that's not good for our shareholders; but at the same time we are securing some new business. We've had a couple of pretty nice wins in the marketplace there and Scott, if I talk about it any more, I'll be giving our competitors a little bit more information than I want to, but we are going through a pretty significant transformation in Electrical Products, totally focused on increasing the margins and returns. And I couldn't be more happy with the results that that leadership team is delivering.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Is there some point in the next, whatever quarter, two quarters that we're going to get, maybe, kind of the same kind of granular basis point improvement tags on the water side as we've got on the EP side? You know what I mean?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
You mean productivity numbers or something 
<A  Paul Jones>:
You know how you say you're expecting X basis points from this, that and the other, from the three main strategies. You have a couple of dissimilar strategies going on in water, but you don't have specific basis point expectations there. Is that something that you guys are going to maybe give us something more granular on or should we not expect that?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Yeah, we do some things internally. The Water Products business had gone through some pretty significant restructuring back with the acquisitions of State Industries, and we had another significant one with the acquisition of GSW. We were a little behind on that with the Electrical Products, and that's why a lot of what we've been doing there is catch-up. But we have  we certainly have, internally, some roadmaps to profitability. Let me just say that we'll talk about it internally and if we can provide something there that would not be a competitive information that our competitors would love to see, we'll see if we can come up with something. But right off the top of my head, I can't think of any of the internal things we have going on that we want out in the public domain.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Well, thank you for being so forthcoming.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
 
Operator: All right, thank you. And we'll go now to the line of Matt Summerville with Cubibanc [KeyBanc]. Please go ahead.
Cubibanc. Hello, Matt.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Good morning.
<Q>:
You guys change your name, Matt?
<A>:
No, I hope not. Actually, this is Tony Curam on for Matt.
<Q>:
Okay, Tony, go ahead.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Couple of questions. Just give, if you could, a little color on or guidance on what's going on with the forward contracts for copper and when they might expire?
<Q>:
Well, all of our competitors do the same things we do. I think it's safe to say we've probably done a little bit less this year than in years past. But we don't talk publicly about our  what our hedging is. Some of our competitors have come out with some pretty bold statements relative to some margin calls they've incurred relative to copper with its significant price declines. And you can go look those things up, but we're not going to comment on it.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then as far as the expansion plans go, given the environment, the expansion particularly in China and then longer term in India. Does it still makes sense to be moving forward at the same pace to adding those  that kind of fixed costs to overhead? Are those plans changed at all?
<Q>:
No, and it still makes sense. Our Water Products facility in Nanjing is essentially completed. We're probably  we're putting in some equipment as we go and we do have some available floor space. Our new facility in Yueyang, to tell you a little bit of the internal color, I keep complaining about why it's taking so long because we  again that's a business that serves the global marketplace. And we are experiencing double-digit growth rates and we expect those to continue and we need that new facility not only for productivity, but for capacity reasons. I actually saw a picture yesterday of the building and it's up and it's got windows in it, and very soon we'll have equipment in there and be in production in January. But we're still going forward with those projects and we are having very good receptivity in India with the water heater, the instantaneous water heater, a small wall hung unit designed for their market. It's going very, very well. We still don't have the land allocation, specific land allocation, but we expect to get that soon. As soon as we do, we intend to build a facility and start making that product there.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then one last question and more broadly, not so much with the retailers, the contract negotiations, but more broadly across water heaters and motors. The negotiations with the big customers that are upcoming, do you expect they'll be demand some sort of concession or price reductions as you move forward?
<Q>:
If you're talking water heaters, we only have contracts with the retailers; the wholesalers, it's essentially done off a price sheet that we publish periodically. And our steel costs this quarter are the highest they've been all year. So we're still struggling to make sure that we cover those costs and keep delivering a reasonable return to shareholders. We're going to continue to do that. We've been expanding those margins and it's my expectation we'll continue to do so.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Okay. Thanks so much.
<Q>:
Operator: All right. Thank you. We'll go now to the line of Mark [Mike] Schneider with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
Yes, this is Mike Schneider's brother Mark.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Hi, Mark, good morning.
<A  Paul Jones>:
How are you doing Mike?
<A>:
I'm doing great. I guess first question just goes on production days. We've seen this in the past, when Q4 comes around you have to make significant production reductions to level out the inventory. Do you have an estimate as to the shortfall this quarter that's attributable just to the production reductions, so we can get a sense of when you do reach level-loaded production what, indeed, the earnings run-rate is?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
That's a tough one, Mike. You're talking about what our customers have cut back to?
<A  Paul Jones>:
No I'm talking more A.O. Smith, because I presume that's what's been the added pressure on the earnings this quarter; you guys reduced your own production?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
We've reduced our production because our customers have reduced their production.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Agreed.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
And it's double-digit days, so we're taking out of most of our facilities, which is a lot more than we've ever done in the past. And there's more than one reason for it. We want to make sure that we  first of all, I'm not  frankly, if I were our customers, I'd be as aggressive as they are right now making sure they don't go into next year with a bubble of inventory.
<A  Paul Jones>:
We have an additional incentive right now not to build anything because we're paying more  a lot more for material right now than we have all year. So there's no incentive on our part to be building anything we are not going to sell. So yeah, we're being pretty aggressive right now and taking a lot of days out. We have had some reductions in force. If the order rate doesn't pick up, obviously, we have contingency plans to respond to that, but based on our analysis of the market and conversations that we have hourly and daily with our customer base, we will see a pick up in January, we believe. We just don't know how much, and we've got us some estimates but we're intending to wait and see and we're ready to respond whichever way that goes.
 
And then, I guess, specifically then on the earnings revision this quarter, Terry, do you have an estimate of what that under  or overhead under-absorption pressure was during the quarter?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Well, without giving you specific numbers that is included in there, EPC will be reducing inventories as will WPC throughout the quarter. So there will be an absorption hit in that number, that's included in that number.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Yeah, Mike, if you add up all the hits that we've had it's actually more than we're reducing the earnings because we're having some things that we've done on the other side to help offset that. So, by dropping our earnings estimate by $0.15 or $0.20 or so, we're actually have got some pretty big numbers flowing through that and some of those are positive.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And in fact, next question on that is, I believe you have been anticipating about $0.05 of restructuring this quarter as part of the $0.25 you had announced for the year. Is that number actually greater now based on some additional actions that have been accelerated?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
It's actually been a bigger number than $0.05, Mike. We've been saying about $0.25 for the year. And I think we're saying right now, what's fourth quarter, $0.10, $0.11?
<A  Paul Jones>:
[Inaudible]
<A>:
Is that all the benefit?
<A  Paul Jones>:
No, no. What the actual restructuring expenses will be realized during Q4. I think if we take the year-to-date amount and back into the fourth quarter, you were looking for about $0.05 in Q4, and I'm just curious if this earnings revision incorporates a bigger number than that?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
< No, it's still the same thing that we've been doing all along, Mike.
A  Paul Jones>:
So the $0.25 for the year has not grown?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
No, it's all 
<A>:
[Inaudible]
<A>:
It actually might be a little lower.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Maybe a little lower than that, Mike.
<A>:
Okay.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Mike, our restructuring expense this year was $0.09 in the first quarter, it was actually about flat in the second quarter, a nickel in the third quarter. And it's going to be, we think, probably more than $0.10 in the fourth quarter. But it's not grown based on anything that we've done so far.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Got it.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Anything we've done in this quarter.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
And then, looking into Q1, I realize you expect orders to at least sequentially improve as orders, at least, begin to match the sell through rate. Do you expect production days to be down year-over-year in Q1 and Q2 for A.O. Smith?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
No.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So you think you can adjust your inventories adequately just this quarter?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Yeah, yeah. We  as I've said, there is absolutely no incentive for us to make anything we're not going to sell this quarter.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And the  I understand why distributors aren't ordering during Q4 to adjust their inventories to demand levels, and obviously cash flow is a trouble for a number of these bigger guys. Do you sense, though, that there's additional orders being pushed out based on your conversations with them because they expect lower prices in Q1 and Q2? Just as you're not building in Q4, they're not ordering in Q4?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
The answer is no. No, they're just trying to make sure they're not going into the year with any inventory that they don't absolutely need.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then China and the slowing growth rates there, you've mentioned the stimulus package's benefit to you in 2009. Based on what I understand where the money is going in China, though, I'm not clear how that would benefit your motor business or your water heater business directly.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Some of that money is going to housing, specifically. That's one of the five categories listed in  yeah, they've got a little bit of a housing bubble and that's impacting their employment, the trades, everything else, and they want to stimulate housing construction. And, I mean, that obviously helps us.
<A  Paul Jones>:
All right. Okay. And then Yueyang has been impacted as well, or maybe from your earlier comments, it actually has held up its growth rates?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Yeah, it's doing great.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And Terry, just on goodwill or asset impairment as you go into 2009, do you sense that there's a potential for an asset write-off?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
I talked about that a little bit yesterday and our sense is now that there would not be any, we don't have any exposure for a write-off in 09. Now, as we go through some more specific calculation, and will do so at the end of the year, but based on what we're looking at for our planning process next year and then to the following two years, in the 2009 to 2011 we don't see any asset impairment.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay. And then pension expense in 2009, Terry, with the discount rate presumably going down, but your plan assets down?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Looks like pension rates will almost double next year  or pension expense will almost double next year.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
 
Okay. From what to what?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
From 4 to 7.5, 7.8 million, something like that.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay. And then finally just on the SICO transaction, Paul, the  this may be a non-issue, but if the spin-off occurs on the first of the year and the shareholder vote doesn't go through, does that  what occurs then?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
It's  the spin-off is really a Smith Investment Company thing that they're doing. The vote will take place in April for both sets of shareholders, and we are highly confident there's not going to be an issue with the shareholder vote.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And do the non-Smith Investment Company shares vote as an independent group?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
No. They vote as shareholders, like all the other shareholders.
<A  Paul Jones>:
As one group?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
[Inaudible], the majority of whom are Smith family members.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Got it. Okay, thank you.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Operator: All right, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go to the line of Alan Mitrani at Sylvan Lake Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Hi, thank you. You said you're paying some of the highest costs all year for steel, and I assume that's true for copper and the other raw materials this quarter?
<Q>:
No, I wouldn't say that's true for the other raw materials.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. How long until it cycles through, that you see the benefit of all the drops that have happened in the commodity market?
<Q>:
We work off a trailing three-month index. So it's already started to drop down, based on what happened in October and November relative to declines in the steel index.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Is this an index we can track here? Is there a ticker symbol for it?
<Q>:
It's called CRU.
<A  Paul Jones>:
CRU?
<Q>:
It's a widely used steel index.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Okay. And what are you doing with  so you have, I mean, you have high cost product then that you're not able to sell, I assume, because your distributors or customers don't want to buy product that was marked up in price if they see the price of steel and others coming down too, I assume. So what do you do with that product? How do you move it out or do you just take hits on to your gross margin?
<Q>:
I don't think your assumption is correct at all. We take orders and we ship them. We are still getting orders, we're still shipping product. Our steel and a lot of the commodities and freight costs went up early in the year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
I'll just talk about our water heater business. We had two significant price increases as that was occurring in the second and third quarters. And those have held in the marketplace and they're still out there, customers are ordering product and we're shipping it. It may not be at the full rate of the replacement level of what their sell through is, but it's close to that. And they're still buying the product and reselling it. People will not take the cold shower more than once. And that's the big driver of that business.
Okay. Also, you know in mid-October, I guess, you raised your estimates on the year, correct?
<Q>:
Well, because of the strong third quarter results, we actually lowered our fourth quarter estimate at that time.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Right. Okay. I guess that's fair. And what are you seeing your competitors do, are you seeing similar on the  specifically on the Electrical Products side, whether it's the Baldors or RBCs of the world. Are they doing all the same things, you know, curtailing investments, I'm sorry, curtailing operating days, cutting back I mean, or is it just you guys doing it ahead of them?
<Q>:
You'll have to discuss that with them, we're not going to comment on or speak for them.
<A  Paul Jones>:
You don't have to speak specifically to specific competitors, what I'm wondering is it an isolated situation in terms of what you're doing, or are you doing similar to what the industry is doing? I'm not asking what your earnings are relative to them, but more from terms of the actions that you're taking?
<Q>:
Once again, you can call them and let them say so, but I'm pretty sure they're probably doing same things we're doing.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Do you see opportunities for market share gains in this situation? Are you seeing any shifts in market share on the EPC side?
<Q>:
We've picked up a little bit of business that we're proud of. But again, we don't discuss that because it would be giving too much information to our competitors.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
And just remind us where is EPC, how much of that business is domestic versus in Europe or in Asia?
<Q>:
It's essentially about 60%, I think, in North America. The rest is, although the part outside the U.S., North America is growing rather dramatically.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And which is weaker, the North America part or the 40% overseas?
<Q>:
North America is weak. I talked about the Yueyang facility, we just acquired that, I believe, in November of 05, if I remember correct. And our volumes are well over double what they were when we acquired them. And they sell products all over the world and they've got huge growth in Middle East, for example. And these make, they make high voltage air conditioning  hermetic motors for air-conditioning systems. They go into commercial construction, primarily.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And lastly, it seems like everybody's trying to focus on 09. I know you don't have visibility into your business in general with five days of orders and minimal backlog, but it seems like from a construction perspective, commercial construction is going to be down viciously next year, domestically, with the government offsetting some of that with some of their spend. But it seems like there are no projects or very, very few projects on the drawing board for the end of 09 and 2010. I don't know, if you're  and you're obviously not thinking that far out, but have you seen the cliff that's coming in a year from now as it relates to commercial construction, given that no one could finance anything now?
<Q>:
Well, once again, I don't agree with your assumption. We sell the light commercial, like on the water heater side. Now we make 150 gallon water heaters for restaurants and things like that. We have seen some  well, quite a few opportunities there. We are going  we are seeing a decline right now, as I said in my prepared remarks. And we expect to continue that to decline into next year. But we don't have a sub-prime issue here or anything like that, or an overbuild of light commercial buildings anywhere near the extent that we did in residential. So while we're seeing  expecting a decline, we're not using the words vicious and precipitous and anything like that. Maybe the high-rise constructions and the big condos, the Donald Trump type projects are not going to be being done late next year. But that's not really a market that we participate in to any great extent.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. I appreciate that. I would encourage you to take a look at some of the announcements from retailers, mall operators and restaurants in terms of their cap spending and store expansions for next year, which look to be store  net store closings on a lot of fronts, just to get a sense of what's coming 8 to 12 months down as opposed to just looking at three to six months.
<Q>:
I can assure you that we are well aware of that. Are you aware of how many water heaters a Wal-Mart store has in it?
<A  Paul Jones>:
Hopefully a heck of a lot, for your sake.
<Q>:
No, one small one. That's it, for a bathroom. A lavatory.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Thanks a lot.
<Q>:
Operator: All Right. Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Scott Graham with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
 
Hey, I just want to ask Terry a quick question on the tax rate. Is there any reason for us to assume that something other than 25 is the truth here, or is that a number that could actually drift upward next year?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
It's going to drift upward. Remember, there's a couple of things that have happened. One is that, we're losing our China holidays, that's one thing. Another thing that's happening is that a greater percentage of our profitability is from outside of the United States. That pushed it the other way, with the offset of increase in tax rates in both Mexico and in China, the tax rate will go up a little bit. I think we're projecting somewhere 25 this year and 27-ish next year.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
27-ish next year. Okay. Thank you.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And I have no further question at the queue. Please continue.
Paul W. Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thanks Reggie. And we want to thank everybody for your interest and hope everybody has a great holiday season. We look forward to talking to you in January.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Service. You may now disconnect.

Subject Company: A. O. Smith Corporation
Subject Company's Commission File No. 1-475
January 22, 2009
A. O. Smith announces 2008 earnings of $2.70 per share;
forecasts 2009 earnings of $2.40 to $2.60 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS), one of the world's leading manufacturers of energy-efficient residential and commercial water heating equipment and electric motors, today announced results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2008.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The company reported full year sales of $2.3 billion, essentially flat compared to 2007, and net earnings of $81.9 million or $2.70 per share, approximately seven percent lower than the record $88.2 million or $2.85 per share last year. Earnings included after-tax restructuring and other charges of $5.6 million or $.19 per share in 2008. In 2007, earnings included restructuring and other charges of $.33 per share and tax benefits of $.16 per share.
Fourth quarter sales of $508.6 million were approximately 11 percent lower than fourth quarter 2007 sales of $569.9 million. A. O. Smith earned $6.6 million in the fourth quarter or $.22 per share, compared with the $17.0 million or $.55 per share earned during the same period in 2007. Earnings included after-tax restructuring and other charges of $2.1 million or $.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, fourth quarter 2007 earnings also included tax benefits of $.06 per share.
"2008 was a solid year for our business, in spite of the rapid deterioration of the global economy in the fourth quarter," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, observed. "The volatility of steel and copper prices throughout 2008, coupled with the continuing weakness in the domestic residential housing market, made 2008 a very challenging year. If you add to that the precipitous volume declines in the fourth quarter, 2008 changed from an unfavorable business climate into one of the worst in recent memory."
"Despite these incredible headwinds, I am proud of our employees' ability to navigate the challenges that we encountered in 2008. As a result of the hard work of our experienced team, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and debt to capital ratio of 34 percent," Jones continued. "We are in a good financial position in spite of the recession. We continue to focus on preserving cash and reducing our cost structure to maintain our solid financial position."
Water Products Company
Water Products sales of $1.45 billion in 2008 were approximately two percent higher than 2007 sales of $1.42 billion. A 26 percent increase in sales of water heaters in China and pricing that partially covered higher material costs helped offset lower residential and commercial water heater volumes.
Operating profit decreased approximately 10 percent to $134.7 million due to lower residential volumes and higher raw material costs partially offset by pricing actions. Operating margin decreased to 9.3 percent compared with 10.5 percent the prior year.
Fourth quarter sales were $346.2 million, approximately $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. China sales increased 11 percent, but were overshadowed by lower sales to the residential and commercial water heater markets. Operating earnings of $29.5 million were significantly lower than last year's record fourth quarter earnings. Earnings were impacted by lower residential and commercial volumes and higher raw material costs not fully covered by price increases. As a result, operating margins declined to 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In late December, Water Products received a land allotment near Bangalore, India, and will begin construction in the second quarter 2009 of a new 76,000 square foot plant. The plant is centrally located in one of the company's key target markets in India with a growing consumer class interested in premium water heating solutions. The company designed a residential product line specifically for this market and is currently importing the products from its plant in Nanjing, China. The company expects to begin water heater production in India during the second quarter of 2010.
Electrical Products Company
Electrical Products 2008 sales of $858.1 million were approximately four percent lower than 2007 sales of $894.0 million. Pricing actions related to higher material costs were more than offset by lower motor volumes caused by the decline in the housing market and customer inventory reductions at the end of the year.
Operating earnings of $39.1 million were significantly higher than the $23.1 million earned in 2007. Earnings included $8.7 million of restructuring expense in 2008 compared with $22.8 million in restructuring expense the prior year. Operating profit margin increased to 4.6 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent in 2007 due to lower restructuring costs offset by lower volume.
Fourth quarter sales were $163.2 million, approximately 15 percent lower than 2007 fourth quarter sales of $192.4 million. In response to the weakened housing market and the uncertainty from the overall economic recession, OEM customers significantly reduced production schedules during the quarter, resulting in lower order volume. The Electrical Products Company lost $5.2 million in the fourth quarter which included $2.9 million in restructuring expense. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Electrical Products recorded an $18 million loss which included $21.2 million of restructuring expense.
At the end of 2008, Electrical Products completed the announced closings of the Mebane, N.C., and Scottsville, Ky., plants. The company expects to realize incremental annual cost savings of $15 million in 2009 due to this restructuring initiative, which also included the closure of it plant in Budapest, Hungary, in early 2008. The company also expects to complete construction of its new commercial hermetic motor plant in Yueyang, China, during the first quarter of 2009.
Cash flow and Leverage
Cash flow from operating activities in 2008 of $106.6 million was significantly lower than the $190.5 million achieved in 2007 primarily due to a larger investment in working capital, particularly inventory, and cash deposits associated with margin calls on derivative contracts. The debt to capital ratio of 34 percent at the end of 2008 was the same as last year, but higher than the company expected due entirely to charges to stockholder's equity associated with pension liabilities and derivative contracts.
Smith Investment Company transaction
On Dec. 9, the company announced it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Smith Investment Company (PK:SMIC) under which Smith Investment would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. Expected benefits of the merger include:
 
 
 
"We are pleased with the milestone in our history that this merger represents," Jones commented. "We have worked hard to ensure this is a good deal for our shareholders. It will improve our corporate governance, has the potential to increase the public float, and will result in a small reduction of total shares outstanding."
The transaction is subject to regulatory review and votes by A. O. Smith and Smith Investment shareholders. A. O. Smith expects to complete the transaction by the end of the second quarter.
Outlook
"Given the deteriorating global economic environment that intensified during the fourth quarter, we are taking a more cautious approach to our expectations for 2009. At this time, we are forecasting significantly lower volumes for both our residential and commercial businesses in both operating companies," Jones commented. "Also, we expect an increase of more than $6 million in pension expense. While we are being impacted by global macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to expect sales growth in China."
"In addition, there are a number of factors that we believe will contribute to earnings this year, including improvement in water heater pricing, continued growthalthough at a slower ratein China, and savings from the restructuring initiative at Electrical Products Company. At the same time, we continue to reduce cost throughout our operations. We announced a company-wide workforce reduction program this month for our salaried workforce."
"Notwithstanding these earnings enhancers, the weak economy will challenge us throughout the year," Jones continued. "Consequently, we expect 2009 earnings will be in a range between $2.40 and $2.60 per share.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the A.O. Smith Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later there will an opportunity for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Ms. Pat Ackerman. Please go ahead.
Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer
Thank you, Beverly. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call. With me this morning participating in the call are Paul Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Terry Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; John Kita, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Craig Watson, Vice President, Business Development.
 
Before we begin with Paul's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Paul?
Paul W. Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Pat and good morning to all. Our operating units performed well in 2008 given the difficult conditions in the housing market. The commercial markets have begun softening in the fourth quarter and commodity cost volatility that was best described as a roller coaster.
In spite of those difficulties, we generated sales even with last year of $2.3 billion and earnings of $2.70 per share. Adjusting for restructuring and other charges, we earned $2.89 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $107 million and continue our efforts to preserve cash. Our balance sheet remains strong and our debt to capital ratio is 34%.
Sales at our Water Products operation in China grew 26% to $185 million. We were rewarded by our repositioning activities in our Motor business with $5 million in savings in 2008.
The merger agreement with Smith Investment Company is progressing. This morning, we established 2009 earnings forecast of between $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. We will expand on each of these points in our review today.
I would first like to begin by addressing the market environment currently facing A. O. Smith. Regarding the outlook for 2009, we believe the soft housing market will continue throughout the year and the recession will continue. We believe the softening in the commercial construction market that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of last year will not abate in 2009, leading to a contracting commercial market.
We expect that our growth in China will slow in 2009 but will be positive. And we expect our pension cost will increase by $6 million over 2008 costs. Those major influences will be slightly offset by certain positive developments, as we believe our water heater prices will have a positive impact on our profitability this year. Additionally, the anticipated savings from repositioning activities in our Motor business and from salaried workforce reduction programs will increase in 2009.
Combining all these factors with the overall temperature of the economic environment will make 2009 a challenging year for A. O. Smith and thus our forecast for earnings is lower than what we achieved in 2008.
Terry will now talk about our financial results in more detail. Terry?
Terry M. Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Paul and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Full-year sales of $2.3 billion were flat compared to 2007. Reported net earnings of 81.9 million or $2.70 a share is 7% and 5% lower than last year's numbers. Adjusted for $0.19 in restructuring charges, earnings were $2.89 a share, 4% lower than the adjusted $3.02 a share in 2007.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2008, sales were down 11% to $509 million, while net earnings declined by $10 million to 6.6 million or $0.22 a share. Fourth quarter earnings included $3 million or $0.07 a share of restructuring, compared with a net $0.20 per share for restructuring and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of last year.
Taking a closer look at the individual segments. Water Products achieved sales of 1.45 billion, a modest increase over 2007 sales of 1.42 billion. This segment benefited from a 26% increase in China sales to $185 million. However, lower residential and commercial water heater volumes overshadowed the strong progress in China. Despite selling price improvements to offset higher costs for raw materials, sales in the Electrical Products segment declined 4% in 2008 to 858.1 million. Unit sales were negatively impacted by the weak housing market as well as customer inventory reductions at the end of the year.
Fourth quarter sales of 346.2 million at Water Products declined 9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 due to double-digit declines in commercial and residential water heater unit volumes, partially offset by sales growth of 11% in China. Residential water heater volumes in the fourth quarter fell below what we believe to be replacement levels, which should favorably impact our order rate in the near term as depleted inventories in the distribution channel are replenished.
At Electrical Products, fourth quarter sales of 163.2 million were significantly lower than the same period in 2007 due to weakness in its residential market segment. Although our OEM customers pared back their production schedules in December, we expect them to begin to replenish depleted inventories in the first and second quarters, which will positively impact order volumes.
As we look at operating profits, Water Products 2008 operating profit of 134.7 million represented a 10% decline from 2007. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower residential water heater volumes and higher costs for raw materials and components, which were not completely covered by price increases. Operating profit margin declined to 9.3% in 2008 from 10.5% last year.
At Electrical Products, operating profit for 2008 increased to 39.1 million. It included a restructuring charge before taxes of 8.7 million. Operating profit was 23.1 million in 2007 and included pre-tax restructuring expense of 22.8 million, primarily associated with the 2008 closing of three manufacturing facilities.
Excluding restructuring expenses, the Electrical Products company's operating margin for 2008 was 5.6% compared with 5.1% last year. The increases in operating profit and margin were primarily the result of cost savings associated with product repositioning and pricing actions at targeted accounts.
During the fourth quarter, Water Products sales declined to 29.5 million compared with 45.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Lower residential and commercial water heater sales in the U.S. more than offset an 11% increase in China water heater sales. Fourth quarter operating margin fell to 8.5% compared with 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of significantly lower U.S. volumes of higher margin commercial water heaters, combined with additional margin pressure due to higher steel costs.
 
Electrical Products recorded a $5.2 million loss in the fourth quarter, which included a 2.9 million pre-tax charge for restructuring. Fourth quarter operating loss in 2007 was 18 million and included 21.2 million for restructuring. Excluding restructuring charges, the operating loss at Electrical Products was 2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with adjusted profit of 3.2 million last year. Operating margins of Electrical Products was a negative 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 1.6% in 2007. Despite savings of $2 million from repositioning activities, the steep volume declines drove margins lower, excuse me.
Operating cash flow of 107 million in 2008 was below our expectations and below our record cash flow last year. In addition to higher inventory days, cash deposits associated with derivative contracts negatively impacted cash flow when compared with 2007. Looking ahead, we expect the inventory levels to normalize by the end of the first quarter. The total cash cycle days increased to 65 from 57 last year. A small contraction in accounts payable days and the expansion in inventory days more than offset a reduction in receivable days.
Depreciation and amortization totaled 66 million in 2008 and our capital spending was 66 million. Capital spending is expected to increase to a range between 75 and 85 million in 2009, primarily due to the construction of the water heater plant in India and carryover projects in China that were approved in 2008.
Our debt to capital ratio remained unchanged for the year at 34%. We repaid $40 million in debt during the year, but our leverage ratio was impacted negatively by charges to stockholders' equity associated with higher pension liabilities and losses on derivative contracts. We continue to preserve cash and reduce our cost structure to maintain our solid financial position.
For 2009, we're projecting full-year operating cash flow of about $150 million. This projection includes a voluntary pension contribution of between 35 and $40 million, which is more than double the $15 million voluntary contribution we made in 2008.
Now Paul will talk about the outlook for 2009 and we'll open the call for questions. Paul?
Paul W. Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Terry. As you know, our biggest end markets are residential and commercial construction. The protracted slowdown in the residential market is old news at this point and the slowdown in the commercial market segments we serve is upon us. As you may also be aware, we sell products into fairly mature segments, which have a high component of less volatile replacement demand. This is an important point to consider when you think about our volumes going forward.
As you can see, for Water Products, we estimate the replacement demand to be over 70% and for motors, it's approximately 60%. To elaborate on these points, these charts on slide 15 give you some historical perspective into the stabilizing effect of the replacement market on the water heater industry.
 
Over the last 10 years, the replacement market in the residential water heater industry has been consistently between 7.5 and 8 million units. Since we have a 50% market share, that translates into a nice solid base of sustainable demand for our product. Our commercial business enjoys an industry with the same stability. The replacement volume in the commercial market has fluctuated between about 90,000 and 110,000 units over the last 10 years.
While we expect our replacement demand will continue to provide volume stability that many companies would envy, we were not completely immune to the recession. Therefore, we expect our residential volumes and our higher margin commercial volumes to decline in both businesses in 2009. Also, we are projecting our pension expense will be $10 million, which is higher than 2008.
That said, we also expect benefit from several earnings enhancers in 2009. First, the results from pricing negotiations in our water heater business will fall right through.
Second, we expect growth of rates above GDP in both our high margin water heater and even higher margin commercial hermetic motor business in China in 2009. We continue to penetrate new markets for water heaters in Tier 2 cities by following our retail customers in establishing new distribution in these geographies. In addition at 18%, we now have the largest market share for our electric brand tank-type water heaters in China.
Third, our restructuring activities in motors are on track to deliver $15 million in savings in 2009 and we expect additional savings from the salaried workforce reductions program announced this month. However, notwithstanding these bright spots, we remain cautious for 2009. The persistence of the soft housing market, the slowdown in commercial construction and global recession will continue to pressure our businesses in 2009.
All of these factors will make this year a challenging year for A. O. Smith. But I'm confident that our experienced team is ready for the challenge. Accordingly, we expect earnings to range between $2.40 and $2.60 per share.
And with that we're ready to take your questions. Beverly I'll turn it back over to you.
 
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Schneider, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Good morning, guys.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Good morning, Mike.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Maybe we can just start on what occurred in Q4, then what you expect in Q1. Q4 sales in water heater is down, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what you think the sell through in the market was versus what you actually experienced so we can understand at least a rough mix of what was inventory depletion by distribution in retailers and what was actually the sell through decline?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Okay. Well, fourth quarter was actually below the sell through decline and Mike, it was a  you're talking about a roller coaster, October was okay, November was horrible. Our order rate was dropped across the board. Almost every product line in the U.S. Very, very low order rate. And then it popped back up in December. For the quarter, I think we  I think our number was about $61 million less volume than we thought we were going to have on November 1, before we ended for the quarter. But it was just  everything from customers worried about whether they'd be able to get the bank financing to cover their lines of credit, to everything under the sun. But it picked back up in November, and before you ask, we're off to an expected level of volume on the order rate so far in January.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So the volume decline of 9% in Water Products during the quarter, you're actually running better than that right now in January because of some of this  I guess, more stable inventory expense?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Yes. And the other factor we have is, this is the first time in I think five years we haven't had a price increase in wholesale on January 1. So there was no pre-buy at all, as a matter of fact, it's just the opposite. So we're off to a fairly decent order rate so far.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then on pricing and wholesale for the coming year with no price increase, what have you seen within the channel though in terms of any price discounting that's occurring by you or your competitors now as we go into 2009, given what the CRU index has done?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Well, obviously there's some downward to the pricing pressure. But steel in the fourth quarter was by far the highest steel cost we've ever had in this company. It was up something like 80% over where we started the year. And so we still have steel costs today in the first quarter well ahead of where we were a year ago. And we had more than one price increase last year. Yes, there's been some deterioration, but the first price increase has held fairly well and we expect that will continue, because we had to have that last year to cover the steel costs. And once again, we're off to a  obviously, steel has come down slightly from where it was in the fourth quarter. But it is still significantly above where we were first half of last year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
And in your outlook comments, you said you've assumed for Water that you show volume declines in 2009. What have you assumed for pricing in 2009 as a whole? And maybe just give us some thoughts of distribution versus retail in water?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
I can't split those out. But we've obviously assumed that overall, there will be a price increase over 2008.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And I guess then just final question on the contracts with your distribution and retail customers, can you give us a sense of what percentage actually tied and is automatically adjusted by the CRU index? What kind of -
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
That's only on the motor side, and that's with our OEM customers.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
As of right now, we don't have any wholesale contracts with any of our customers. That's as far as we can have we had, I think three price increases last year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
On the wholesale side and on water heaters.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And have you concluded or finalized your negotiations with your largest retail customer?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
We don't comment on that.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay, thank you.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Thank you.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ned Borland, Next Generation Equity. Please go ahead.
Sure, good morning guys.
<Q  Ned Borland>:
Good morning, Ned.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Just on the China mid-teen growth, I'm wondering if that includes any shipments into India from China?
<Q  Ned Borland>:
Yes it does, not a lot. Although it's more than we  than our original plan was then. We  as you know, we are shipping products into India from China. So specifically design products for the China market. It's actually taking off better than we expected. It's doing quite well there, which is little bit of a  it's a good news / bad news and frankly I'm pleased. The good news is the volume is up, but the bad news is that we're not making any money on those because of  there's a 10% tariff from China into India, and the dollar versus the RMB is strengthening and the dollar versus the rupee is weakening. So we're getting a double currency hit on that too.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
But the good news is, we now have a land allocation and we're in the process of putting together the plant design, and I expect we will be breaking ground there before this quarter is over. And within a year, we expect to have a facility up, early 2010, in India producing product for that market. And I think by then, we will have established the brand name fairly well. Our distribution partner there, the relationship is great, we could not be happier with how this product launch has gone.
Okay, great. And then on Electrical Products, I know the volume decline was pretty staggering. I just want to kind of put in the context of the roadmap initiatives, I mean you shut down in what, three plants in 2008. But I'm just wondering how to think of margins in that segment on a lower level of volume going forward here in 2009?
<Q  Ned Borland>:
Yeah. Our gross margins have been moving up. The roadmap's been working on that side. The problem has been the volume decline. The OEMs, we primarily service the HVAC OEMs.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And you could go just check out what they're saying and that will tell you what we're facing. They're shutting their factories down for several weeks in the fourth quarter. And we're off to what we would consider a shallow start to this year. Some of the factories have stayed down for the first start of the year and they're not running anywhere near the rates that they have in the past.
And we're assuming housing starts for this year now to be 600,000. That's an unbelievable number based on those of us that have been around for a few decades. But that's what our forecast is this year and that's obviously driving the HVAC people to be very cautious.
Okay. And then finally on the salaried head count reduction, any ballpark range of savings expected from that?
<Q  Ned Borland>:
It was  the last one that we did was about 2.6 million in savings, but that's only part of it. We've done quite a bit of reorganizing and eliminating open positions and restructuring that way. But we actually had a salaried lack of work last week that will generate about 2.6 million in savings this year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then just one last one on the guidance. How much of a price increase is embedded in your guidance range? And I mean what is the low end versus the high end  what are the variables on price in  embedded there?
<Q  Ned Borland>:
It's all over the map. But just to give you one indication, we're going into this year with steel at about 25% above where it was this time last year. And steel is about half our cost, so you can do the arithmetic on that. And that's the sort of thing that we're trying to have on year-over-year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Thank you.
<Q  Ned Borland>:
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Graham, Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
 
Hey, good morning.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Good morning, Scott.
<A  Paul Jones>:
I got a couple of questions here for you. Could you first, Terry, maybe walk us through this derivatives impact on cash flow, if you don't mind?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
We've got a number of  we've got foreign exchange contracts, we've got interest rate swaps, we've got copper, we've got aluminum. And if you look at the balance sheet, you can see the number on the balance sheet I think is about 73.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Yeah, yeah.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
About 73 million. Most of that is probably associated with copper. But there are a number of  there are a number of contracts in there. Also what the large numbers associated with those underwater derivative contracts, a good portion of those as you will recall relative to the copper contracts are specific customer contracts. So they bear the risk on those contracts, we don't bear the risk on them. And the remainder would be those to which we're exposed to on hedging contracts, which at a point in time, that is the value date at the end of the year for underwater. That's not to say that that may not change during the year, because that's a measurement on which we make the entry on the balance sheet at the end of the year.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay, all right. But it's a balance sheet entry?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
It's a balance sheet entry relative to valuing contracts at the end of the year.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Right. So I guess my follow-up question would be, why was the change in current assets and liabilities a negative this quarter when, whereas historically, we've kind of sourced cash out of that line?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Well, what happened is there was a dramatic drop in the peso and the price of copper in the fourth quarter, which resulted from those mark-to-markets being moved from an asset to a liability. Again, it didn't really affect cash flow, because that's a non-cash flow item in the quarter, it's a balance sheet adjustment.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
And the adjustment is made every quarter, Scott.
<A  John Kita>:
Right.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Right, right. So okay, maybe I didn't ask the question right or maybe you guys misunderstood it. We had a change in operating working capital  operating of the working capital items in the fourth quarter. It was a minus. And in the past, it's always been a plus. And I was just wondering if the derivative contract settlements in marks-to-market and all that is largely balance sheet, which was the answer I expected, why are we negative in the fourth quarter on that line?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Two things really happened in the quarter. The biggest one, accounts payable, was down pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter and also the margin, we had to make some margin payments during the quarter. So those were the two biggest factors. And again, those margin payments related to the derivative contracts. So those accounts payable and margins were really the biggest factors on negative cash flow from what you're probably expecting.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
 
Right. I think accounts payable is a lot of that answer, so I guess my follow-up question for that would be, why did you have to do that?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
The biggest issue is we saw volumes dropping dramatically as Paul said in November, December, which resulted in purchases dropping in November, December and we had to make  we had to make payments by the end of the year.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Got you. So then, would it be fair to say that if you didn't really match that up with the production per se, should we see a big  a nice positive cash source out of working capital in the first quarter?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
I can't say the first quarter, but we definitely would hope that in 2009, we'll have favorable working capital.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
We usually are a cash user in the first two quarters and a cash generator in the last two.
<A  John Kita>:
Right. But -
<Q  Scott Graham>:
It's safe to say, Scott, that we went into the year with more inventory on some of the operations than we planned to, both raw, in process and some finished goods. We will get those inventories in line in the first quarter. So that will help offset the cash usage somewhat. But I don't think we're ready to predict what our cash flow will be for the first quarter.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Well, that's fair. All right. Next question has to do with the restructuring plan. And I guess the loss in electrical was a little wider than what I expected. And I guess my follow-up  my question on that would be, is there a way to tell right now, of this $20 million in total, 15 million in 09  where are we at right now, run rate, on that number?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
On the 20 million in savings?
<A  Paul Jones>:
Yeah.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
We will achieve 15 million more this year. We got 5 million last year. That's a solid number.
<A  Paul Jones>:
I don't question that. I'm just saying, are we there now? Will we be there by the end of the first half on a run rate basis?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
I think you can level load it for the quarter. The plants are closed, the costs are gone.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Right, okay. So you're essentially there, right now?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Yes
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
For the most part? Got you.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
The plants are closed, those costs are gone off our income statement.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Right. And additional head count actions would be incremental to that number?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Yes.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay, great. I guess my last question would be along the lines of capital expenditures in 2009. I know you're finishing up construction in the first quarter on the China facility. Is that a number we can expect  I guess I was looking for something in the 55, 60 million range for 09, is that reasonable?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
If you take the 08 and 09 numbers together, what we're predicting, we're still where we were. The thing is, we have quite a bit more carryover. We did not spend as much money on capital in 08 as we had planned. And that's what's driving the 09 numbers up to something in the 80s.
<A  Paul Jones>:
80s?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
As always, cash is king. We're going to be monitoring those capital projects on a monthly basis as we go forward. There's a very heavy emphasis on short payback productivity and a very low emphasis on any maintenance capital right now. So the guidance that Terry gave you are numbers you can use. But you should know that it's our intent to keep our capital expenditures below that if we can.
<A  Paul Jones>:
We have the India facility, which will be all in this year, most of it will be in this year, with not only the facility but equipment. And we are finishing up the Nanjing capacity expansion this quarter as you mentioned.
Okay. Actually I did have one other question, I'm just noticing from my notes here, and that is, on the Electrical Products business, I know we're starting to run off some of the 80/20 rule stuff, things that you're getting out of and what have you. Is there an impact that we can look for revenue-wise on an annualized basis in that business, that will come out?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
It's been coming out over the last couple of years, Scott. I don't think we want to quantify what that number is, because some of those discussions are still taking place. But we will see a decline in unit volume and a decline on revenue and an increase in margin, which is what we've been saying we'll have.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Very good. Thanks a lot.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Thank you.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Mammola with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
 
Hi, good morning, guys.
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
Good morning, Paul.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Hi, Paul.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
First, on the Bangalore facility. Do we have a sense of how many units on an annual basis could come out of there and what percentage of the market that might be?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
No, not yet. There's going to be a slow start up. You go back to our Nanjing facility, we did over 1.2 million units last year at Nanjing. But you go back 8 or 10 years ago, it was 50,000 or less, so we'll see.
<A  Paul Jones>:
We're doing the India project differently in that we're getting upfront with the brand and with a solid sales and distribution network. We have quite a few employees there right now in marketing and sales. And we are putting a healthy investment into establishing the sales and distribution network and the brand identity.
When I say healthy investment, it's not only the facility, but as I mentioned earlier, we're going to be recording some small operating losses as we do that. But that's per plan and that's going to generate what we think a very, very good return for our shareholders over the next several decades. We think it's the right decision right now. The beauty is, we've got a balance sheet that allows us to make some long-term decisions like that and we're continuing that one per our original plan.
Okay. Fair enough. And then on Nanjing, I guess I didn't realize that it was going to be finished this quarter. I guess, does that factor in positively to the guidance in 09? I guess more clearly, do you expect that to have a positive impact or a big positive impact?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
Well, we need the capacity. The old facility had capacity for about a million one and we did a million two last year. We're still forecasting growth in China. We're not forecasting another 20 plus percent, 26% growth in China this year. We had a fairly weak  relatively weak fourth quarter, and it's going to be a relatively weak first quarter. There's a lot of things going on in China. The government's forecast is 8.5% GDP growth. We are forecasting 6% within our business. And that's what we are expecting.
<A  Paul Jones>:
But we need that capacity in order to achieve the  a 6% GDP growth will result in a higher  we grow at well above GDP with the niche, the market niche that we serve with our products. That capacity  the facility will be done, but we will not have it completely full of equipment. We're only putting equipment in as necessary. But we're going to stay ahead of the demand curve.
Okay. So Paul, when does that expect to be I guess doubled in capacity which was  I think was the original plan? 50 million units?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
It can be anytime we need it to be. We can be at 2 million units, I think given the slowdown in the housing market in China, which I think is probably going to be a six-month event, not a multi-year event. I think we will be closing in on the 2 million within a couple of years, which means  which is why we're already planning what's the next piece of capacity will be and where that would be located.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then Paul  I'm sorry, Terry, on the  given those projects, I guess is there a meaningful tick up in G&A next year? Is there an expectation for a number there?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
The depreciation and amortization will be in 70 million range next year. So this is not a significant impact.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay. And then given the China holidays rolling off, are we expecting a 30% tax rate in 09?
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
I don't think it's that high.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
No, about 27.5 -
<A  John Kita>:
Yeah, 27.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Somewhere around that.
<A  John Kita>:
Okay, fair enough. Thanks for your time.
<Q  Paul Mammola>:
.27.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Thank you.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ted Wheeler, Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Yeah. Hi, good morning all.
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Good morning, Ted.
<A  Paul Jones>:
I wonder if I could just get your outlook parsed a little bit by market. If I looked at Water Products, I mean, commercial, residential, could you give us a little estimate of what you think those two markets would be? And then in Electrical, I know you do a little breakdown on air conditioning and distribution and Paul, just maybe a little color on that would be helpful.
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Well, I can give you a little but not a lot. One of the charts that we have in the presentation showed the commercial market for water heaters. We're expecting that total market to be off somewhere in the 10 to 15% range. I think our market assumptions are about 140,000 units down from I think close to 160,000 this year in 08. I mean, that's a rough estimate of what we think it will be. I'll admit, it's a rather fuzzy -
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
Oh yeah.
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Outlook right now as to what we see. We do  the replacement business will be there, that's another good news / bad news. It hardly ever grows, but the good news is it's always there. Of course right now we're very happy to have that level of replacement business.
<A  Paul Jones>:
The commercial market on the motor side I think will not have as big a decline. We're more global there. We ship product all over the world. And there are some places that are still doing quite well. So we have some  a little bit more positive outlook on the commercial market on the motor side, maybe not a growth element, but not a bigger decline.
What about the residential water heater market? You think that's double-digit down?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
I don't know whether it will be double-digit down, but we believe it will be down. The housing starts  housing  almost 2 million units out of $9.5 million market and it's now going to be 600,000 units out of an $8 million market. So that's pretty significant over the last two years. We got some of that decline last year. I'm not optimistic on U.S. residential marketplace other than the replacement business. People still will not take a cold shower more than once, no matter what their credit card balances are.
<A  Paul Jones>:
The pricing comments you made, I guess three price increases in the wholesale order market, and I think you said that steel is up 25% today versus beginning of last year?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
That's a rough number.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Now, is that -
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
We have prices all over the place depending on the kind of steel. But that's a rough number.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Well is that 25% a rough number or spot number, or is that your cost?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
It's our costs which are tied to  as mentioned earlier by Mike Schneider. We  our costs are tied to a trailing three month CRU Index and  with adjustments from that based on our negotiations with our steel suppliers.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Well -
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
And the trailing three months is October, November, December. October was still a big number, it was over $1000 a ton. November and December obviously declined and I think our January number was down $5 a ton on the CRU. I just got that a couple of days ago.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So your costs will be, if all stays the same, would be down by the end of the year from where we are now?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Yeah, the fourth quarter of 2009 will be hopefully a lot less than 2008.
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
And your pricing, I think you indicated prices will be up? You wouldn't say how much, but prices will be up?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
That's what we expect, yes.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So if that holds, certainly your water heater margins should be higher next year? I'm sorry, 09 versus 08, I would think?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Well it depends on the market and it depends on competitive pressures. But that's certainly our expectation right now.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And I guess the retail pricing negotiations, aren't they always sort of end of February when they're concluded and finalized?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
It's typically in this quarter, yes.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So I mean you wouldn't say whether those are in your expectation or not. But you must have a pretty good idea what is going to transpire there?
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
I can't comment. But we're still in discussions.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So okay, we'll get that feeling heard  firmed up by the end of the quarter then? Thank you very much.
<Q  Ted Wheeler>:
Thank you.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
A couple of questions. I think you had originally guided at $0.25 in your restructuring charges in 08. It turned out to be 19. Does that mean we have some spill over into 2009? And then alongside that, are there any meaningful restructuring expenses contemplated in the 2.40 to 2.60 guidance?
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
Relative to the restructuring expenses being less than 08, there is no spillover. We had overestimated what they were going to be. And relative to 2009, there is nothing in the guidance for restructuring.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay. And then Terry, can you comment on what your cash contribution to the pension will look like in 2009 and how you think about 2010 in context of the funded status of the plan? Versus what that number would have been in 08?
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
I can tell you it will be very large. I think in 2008, our voluntary contribution was about 15 million. We're looking at a voluntary contribution someplace between 35 and $40 million in 2009 and a number that's much larger than that in 2010.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Having said that, of course, it depends upon how the markets perform and it depends upon where the  what will happen to the discount rates. But at least given the knowledge that we know today, we booked and you can see that on the balance sheet, about a 200 plus million dollar liability  increased liability on the balance sheet, which we have to make up over this seven year period of time.
 
So the required contribution to the plan next year is probably in the 7 million range. But if that is all that we would make, we would be looking at significantly higher contributions going forward. So our expectation is that we had 15 million this year, that we'll have something in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 million next year, and something that's significantly higher than that in 2011. 2010, excuse me.
So in your operating cash flow guidance, is that increase in cash out the door pension of 20 to 25 million 09 versus 08, is that in your operating cash flow guidance?
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
Yes it is. That's in the 150 million guidance, yes.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
Okay. When I look at  I just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics at play here. When I think about pricing, Paul, in the motor business 09 versus 08, you talked about steel a little bit. Can you put how you think pricing is going to evolve through the full year in context of not only steel and the lag you have, but also what's happened with copper? I guess I'm having a hard time being convinced that you'll see higher price realizations in motors 09 versus 08, all things considered.
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
Well, a lot  it's most of that business is contractual. So we moved the selling price of our customers based on the same indices we buy steel at. So we essentially protect ourselves on the upside and the downside there. So as that moves, we ought to be able to maintain essentially the same margins.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Copper, yeah, I mean we've got a lot of customers that have contracts with us as Terry mentioned earlier. They are significantly above the spot price. And we have some exposure on our own that are above the spot price. We have  we don't talk that much about what we do on hedging. I think it's safe to say that we have hedged over the recent, starting last spring when copper got up to $4 a pound. We were not doing hedging at that point, I don't think any of our competitors were either.
But as it started coming down, we have consistently implemented our hedging strategy. We are not fully hedged for the year, thank goodness. So we will be in the spot market from time to time and the majority of the out of the money contracts we have are customer specific, and the customer is bearing the risk of that and will be paying whatever the copper contract price is.
Okay. You mentioned I think in your prepared remarks that growth in the water heater business from China was 10, 11% in Q4 and your  it sounds like embedded in your guidance is an acceleration in that growth rate. Can you talk about the logic behind that and then how much you anticipate your China electrical products business growing 09 versus 08?
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
Well I think we're going to have a weak first quarter in both businesses, because there's still a carryover from the weakness in the China market in the fourth quarter. But our expectations in  we've got about I think 12 forecasts out of China from various people that we've been massaging and looking through. We're going on the conservative side of that and expecting a GDP growth of about 6%. We typically do  our volume is typically on the water
<A  Paul Jones>:
 
heater side about three times that, on the electrical product side is typically at about the GDP growth. So year-over-year, those are just some rough numbers that we should expect. But it's going to be a weak first quarter. There's still an excess of available housing. But the government's got a stimulus package coming out and they've changed some of their policies relative to residential housing that are going to help us quite a bit, we believe, this year.
Okay. You commented, I think as well that within the water heater business, it appeared that your out the door sales were trailing below what the normal replacement demand would be. How would you characterize the motor business in that regards and how would you describe overall channel inventories in the motor business as well, as we sit here right now?
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
I'd characterize it the same way. We had a horrible November in both businesses, an incoming order rate that was below the replacement market. I think channel inventories are in good shape. The problem is the sales out of the channel to the end users are significantly down because of the housing situation.
<A  Paul Jones>:
So we're off to a  as I said, a fairly slow start by the OEMs. A lot of them, you can go onto their  some of them have already come out with comments this year publicly. And you can see what they're saying, and when they keep a factory down for two or three weeks, additionally, that's two or three weeks we don't ship motors into them. That's not going to last for the rest of the year. There will be a pick up, that's why we typically build inventories in the first and second quarter, is serving the growth in HVAC and pump markets that we typically get in the spring time.
Thanks a lot. That's all I had.
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
It's just getting off to a slow start.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Got you. Thank you.
<Q  Matt Summerville>:
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Michael Schneider, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Good morning again. Maybe we can just talk about just Q1 down looking ahead based on what we've seen in Q4. For your inventory depletion efforts, would you expect the overhead hit as you reduce production days to be as great in Q1 versus Q4 versus Q4 or will it be lesser so?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
We're going to have a little bit of absorption, but that's good. I mean nobody gets in trouble for doing that because they're generating cash flow. Again, another advantage we have to be able to take a long-term approach. Characterizing it to Q4 to Q1, I think Q1 would be better, but I don't know how much better at this point.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And to reduce  but I haven't at least a rough calculation on what absorption cost during Q4?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
No. John, do you have any idea? I don't have.
<A  Terry Murphy>:
On the EPC side, my recollection is it costs is 2 to $3 million.
<A  John Kita>:
 
And water heaters not as significant?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Water heaters was not as significant.
<A  John Kita>:
No. No.
<A  Terry Murphy>
:
Okay. And then when  if we can go back, just to the contribution of pricing versus volumes, was the price cost curve actually positive in motors during Q4?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Q4 was our highest cost steel by far as steel shot up in July, August, September. That was a one-time event, Mike, it was not good. We were  we had these huge steel costs at the same time markets were declining and the spot market for steel was going down significantly. We think we got that balance now. But Q4 was, we believe, a negative anomaly that we don't expect to see come back again.
<A  Paul Jones>:
And it was clearly negative in the water heaters, correct?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Yes.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And then as far as the declines in water products, was  were both commercial and residential down double-digits in units? Or was one down materially more than the other?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
In the fourth quarter, that's true, they were. Commercial is down significantly in the fourth quarter and we're expecting it will be weaker this year.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And what was the pricing contribution in water during Q4, so we can understand the price volume mix?
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Our lawyer won't let me give any of that information out, I'm sorry. I can't do that for competitive reasons.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. And that I believe was it, thank you.
<Q  Michael Schneider>:
Thank you, Mike.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Scott Graham with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
Hi, guys. Just this question for you. I know that in the water heaters business, particularly when it comes to the wholesale distribution side, that the number of price increases that the industry has kind of needed to jam into that channel the last couple of years, how's you guys' thinking that there's a market share opportunity if you could maybe buck that trend? So my question simply is, my sense from speaking with you in recent months is that you would like to be able to actually take some pricing off the wholesale distribution and maybe other areas? Could you talk about that for particularly  and maybe not particularly, conceptually  what do you guys thinking on that right now?
<Q  Scott Graham>:
 
I don't agree with what you said at all, to be blunt. We have been on a kick to get our margins up there. We will not be utilizing price to do that. We have a major program on service and quality and features, new products, new high efficiency products, and that's our focus to grow market share. But we're not going to use the P word to do that. It's going to be by being a value added supplier and somebody that they can count on, because it's our intent to continue to get margin expansion there.
<A  Paul Jones>:
Okay. Well, thank you.
<Q  Scott Graham>:
Operator: Thank you. And currently there are no additional questions in queue. Please continue.
Paul W. Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thanks everybody for your interest in the company and as always, feel free to give us a call anytime if you have questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On April 17, 2009, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
At the annual meeting of the Company's stockholders, held on April 14, 2009, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the A. O. Smith Combined Incentive Compensation Plan ("the Plan") effective February 10, 2009. This amends the Plan which had been previously approved by the stockholders in 2002.
The purpose of the Plan is (i) to provide additional compensation as an incentive to induce key employees and directors to remain in the employ of the Company; (ii) to secure or increase on reasonable terms their stock ownership in the Company or to otherwise align their interests with the Company's stockholders; (iii) to motivate such employees and directors, by means of growth-related incentives, to achieve long-range growth goals; and (iv) to provide incentive compensation opportunities which are competitive with those of other major corporations.
The amendment to the Plan increases the total number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Plan by 1,250,000. The Company cannot currently determine the benefits, if any, to be paid under the Plan in the future to the officers of the Company, including the Company's named executive officers. The Plan and the amendment thereto are described in detail in the Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Schedule 14A on March 5, 2009 in connection with the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on April 14, 2009.
 
On April 14, 2009, the stockholders of the Company approved the merger of Smith Investment Company into a subsidiary of the Company. The merger also was approved by Smith Investment Company's stockholders on April 16, 2009. Closing on the merger will take place when all conditions to closing have been met.
 
The following exhibit is being filed herewith:
(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated April 17 2009.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 14, 2009
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
April 17, 2009
A. O. Smith reports first quarter earnings of $8.7 million, $.29 per share; modifies 2009 guidance to $1.80 and $2.10 per share
Citing a substantial decline in its end market demand, A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced first quarter earnings of $8.7 million or $.29 per share, compared with $21.9 million or $.72 per share last year.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Sales for the three-month period ended March 31 were $481.6 million, approximately 16 percent lower than first quarter 2008 sales of $571.4 million.
"The market trends we experienced in the fourth quarter carried over into the first quarter of this year," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones said. "The latest data indicate the housing contraction will be deeper and longer than last year, affecting a number of important electric motor market segments as well as our residential water heater market. In addition, the weakness in commercial construction that we saw materializing in the fourth quarter has continued into this year."
"Faced with inventory destocking during the prolonged recession and no sign of the normal seasonal inventory build in our selling channels, we are adjusting the company's earnings outlook for the year to $1.80 to $2.10 per share," Jones said. "Despite the weak market conditions, the company's balance sheet remains strong, and our cash conservation programs are bearing results. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $6.0 million, a $20.9 million swing from the $14.9 million cash used in last year's first quarter. We were able to accomplish this despite the fact that earnings were $13.2 million lower than a year ago."
"Our operating units have aggressively reduced costs in response to the global recession and have programs to decrease inventories worldwide, postpone or reduce capital expenditures, and reduce overall expenses," Jones continued. "I am confident the company will manage its way through these economic challenges, by maintaining substantial profitability and continuing to expand our new product development."
 
Water Products
Water Products' first quarter sales of $339.0 million were approximately four percent lower than first quarter 2008 sales of $352.1 million. Lower sales of residential and commercial water heaters in North America, combined with lower sales in China, more than offset price increases related to higher steel costs.
Operating profit decreased 19 percent to $29.1 million due to the lower volumes. Operating margin decreased to 8.6 percent compared with 10.2 percent in last year's first quarter.
Electrical Products
Electrical Products' first quarter sales decreased approximately 35 percent to $143.6 million, as the weak residential and commercial construction markets and customer inventory reduction actions adversely impacted electric motor sales.
In the first quarter of 2009, Electrical Products lost $3.1 million compared with first quarter 2008 earnings of $11.1 million, as the company faced significant volume declines in its end markets. The impact of the volume declines more than offset the $5 million in cost savings achieved from product repositioning activities during the quarter.
Outlook
"OEM motor customers are forecasting anywhere from 20 to 30 percent year over year volume declines in 2009, and we are aligning our cost structure with this lower level of market demand," Jones commented. "Since the beginning of the year, we have significantly reduced our hourly and salaried workforce around the world. And we have and will continue to implement significant cost reduction programs."
"As a result of weak demand and the prolonged and severe housing slump, we are reducing our annual guidance to between $1.80 and $2.10 per share," Jones said. "But, we are optimistic that we will still generate $140 to $150 million in operating cash flow this year, despite our lower earnings outlook and higher pension plan payments."
"And, we see some optimistic signs in our major markets. Replacement demand for residential and commercial water heaters is holding up at expected levels, and we still expect to see the $15.0 million in incremental cost savings from Electrical Products'
 
restructuring initiatives. Our priorities in 2009 will be to conserve cash while making the necessary investments to maintain our competitive position and high level of service to our customers. This will include moving forward with our water heater venture and facility in India, developing the high efficiency products the market will need, and focusing on renewable technologies."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

On April 14, 2009, at a Special Meeting of Stockholders of A. O. Smith Corporation (the "Company"), the stockholders approved an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Charter") of the Company. The Company filed the amended Charter with the Delaware Secretary of State on April 22, 2009, at which time it became effective and modified the rights of holders of the Company's common stock and Class A common stock. The following summarizes the amendments to the Charter and the modifications to the rights of holders of the Company's common stock and Class A common stock:
Increase in the Number of Shares of A. O. Smith Class A Common Stock.
The amended Charter increased, solely for purposes of completing the merger with Smith Investment Company, the authorized number of shares of A. O. Smith Class A common stock from 14,000,000 shares to 22,067,252 shares. Following the effective time of the merger, A. O. Smith canceled the shares of A. O. Smith Class A common stock held by Smith Investment Company prior to the merger. Under the amended Charter, the Company is prohibited from reissuing such shares of A. O. Smith Class A common stock after they are cancelled, so that the total number of shares of A. O. Smith Class A common stock that the Company is authorized to issue will return to 14,000,000.
Increase in the Number of Directors the Holders of A. O. Smith Common Stock are Entitled to Elect.
The Charter previously provided that the holders of A. O. Smith common stock, voting as a class, elected 25% of the members of A. O. Smith's board of directors. The amended Charter increased this percentage to 33-1/3%. If 33-1/3% of the authorized number of directors is not a whole number, then the holders of common stock are entitled to elect the nearest higher whole number of directors that is at least 33-1/3% of the board of directors. Holders of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, elect the remaining directors. The A. O. Smith Board currently consists of ten directors under the amended Charter; the holders of A. O. Smith common stock elect four of the ten directors.
Conversion of Class A Common Stock Upon Transfer
The amended Charter provides that shares of the Company's Class A common stock convert automatically into common stock, subject to certain exceptions, upon transfer to unaffiliated third parties.
Automatic Conversion of Class A Common Stock to Common Stock
The amended Charter also provides that once the outstanding shares of Class A common stock fall below 2,397,976, which is approximately 8% of the total outstanding shares of the Company's Class A common stock and common stock as of the date of this Current Report, each outstanding share of Class A common stock will convert into a share of common stock.
 
The foregoing description is a summary and is not intended to be complete. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended Charter, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report.
 
In accordance with the amended Charter discussed in Item 3.03 of this Current Report, the holders of common stock of the Company will elect four of the ten directors in future elections. The board of directors designated Mr. Ronald D. Brown, who was previously elected a director by the holders of the Company's Class A common stock, to become a common stock director. To effect such designation, Mr. Brown resigned as a Class A common stock director effective April 22, 2009 and was appointed by the board of directors as a common stock director effective April 22, 2009. Mr. Brown will serve as a common stock director until the next annual meeting of the Company's stockholders. Mr. Brown is Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee and a member of the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
 
On April 22, 2009, the Company closed the merger of Smith Investment Company (SMIC.PK) into a subsidiary of A. O. Smith Corporation. The merger had been approved by the Company's stockholders on April 14, 2009.

The aggregate number of shares which the corporation has the authority to issue shall initially be eighty-five million sixty-seven thousand two hundred fifty-two (85,067,252) shares, consisting of:
 
 
 
The corporation shall not reissue, after the cancellation thereof, any of the shares of Class A Common Stock held by Smith Investment Company, a Nevada corporation ("SICO"), that are required to be cancelled in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 9, 2008 (the "SICO Merger Agreement"), among the corporation, SICO Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, SICO and Smith Investment Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Any and all such shares of Class A Common Stock, Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be issued for such consideration, not less than the par value thereof, as shall be fixed from time to time by the board of directors. Upon any distribution of authorized but unissued shares to stockholders, the part of the surplus of the corporation (not less than the par value of such shares) which is concurrently transferred to stated capital shall be deemed the consideration for the issue of such shares. Any and all such shares so issued, the full consideration for which has been paid, delivered or so transferred, shall be deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to any further call or assessment thereon, and the holders of such shares shall not be liable for any further payments except as otherwise provided by applicable law of the State of Delaware or any other state in which the corporation holds a certificate of authority to do business. The relative rights, preferences and limitations of each class shall be as follows:
 
Except as provided in this Article 4, the Class A Common Stock and the Common Stock shall have the same rights and privileges and shall rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Voting power shall be divided between the Class A Common Stock and the Common Stock as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be issued upon conversion of the shares of the Class A Common Stock will upon issue be fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any preemptive rights, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The board of directors shall have authority, by resolution or resolutions, to divide the Preferred Stock into series, to establish and designate each such series and the number of shares thereof (which number, by like action of the board of directors from time to time thereafter, may be increased except when otherwise provided by the board of directors in creating such series, or may be decreased but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding), and to determine and fix the rights, preferences and limitations in respect of the shares of each series established prior to the issuance thereof, and the relative variations therein as between series, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by applicable law of the State of Delaware, and (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) particularly with respect to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Except as to the matters in respect to which variations are permitted under this subsection (B)(1), all series of the Preferred Stock of the corporation, whenever designated and issued, shall have the same rights, preferences and limitations and shall rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.
All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock established as hereinabove authorized shall be alike in every particular, and each series thereof shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words or figures.
Any shares of Preferred Stock reacquired by the corporation by purchase or redemption, through conversion, or through the operation of any sinking fund or redemption or purchase account and which are thereafter cancelled shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation, and, subject to the provisions of any series of the Preferred Stock, may thereafter be reissued as part of the same series or may be reclassified and reissued by the board of directors in the same manner as any other authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.
 
Before any dividends, other than stock dividends, shall be paid or set apart for payment upon either the Class A Common Stock or the Common Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate per annum specified as to each series pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(a), payable quarter-annually when and as declared by the board of directors.
Except as otherwise provided with respect to a particular series pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(a), dividends shall accrue, in the case of shares of each particular series:
 
 
 
provided, that if the date of initial original issue of shares of any series shall be within thirty (30) days prior to the date when the first quarter-annual dividend would otherwise be payable, the board of directors may provide that such first dividend shall be payable only at the time of payment of the dividend for the next quarter-annual period, in which case no deficiency in payment of such first dividend shall exist by reason of such deferral.
All dividends of Preferred Stock shall be cumulative so that if the corporation shall not pay the quarterly dividend, or any part thereof, on the Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding, such deficiency in the dividend on the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be fully paid, but without interest, before any cash dividend shall be paid or set apart for payment on either the Class A Common Stock or the Common Stock.
Any dividend paid upon the Preferred Stock at a time when any accrued dividends for any prior period are delinquent shall be expressly declared as a dividend in whole or partial payment of the accrued dividend for the earliest period for which dividends are then delinquent, and shall be so designated to each shareholder to whom payment is made.
All shares of Preferred Stock shall rank equally and shall share ratably, in proportion to the rate of dividend fixed pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(a) in respect to each such share, in all dividends paid or set aside for payment for any dividend period or part thereof upon any such shares.
 
In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation in money or money's worth the applicable amount specified pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(c) with respect to that series of Preferred Stock, together with all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared), before any of such assets shall be paid or distributed to holders of Class A Common Stock or Common Stock, and if the assets of the corporation shall be insufficient to pay the holders of all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding the entire amounts to which they may be entitled, the holders of each outstanding series of the Preferred Stock shall share ratably in such assets in proportion to the amounts which would be payable with respect to such series if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. The consolidating or merger of the corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, or the merger of any other corporation or corporations into the corporation, in pursuance of the laws of the State of Delaware and of any other applicable state providing for consolidation or merger, shall not be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the corporation within the meaning of the foregoing provisions of this subsection (B)(3), unless otherwise provided pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(c).
 
No holder of Preferred, Class A Common Stock or Common Stock shall be entitled, as of right because of his ownership of such stock, to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of any new or additional issue of stock, whether Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock or Common Stock, or of bonds, debentures or other securities convertible into stock, or any part of any reacquired shares or convertible securities held in treasury, but all such shares of stock or bonds, debentures or other securities convertible into stock may be issued and disposed of by the board of directors to such person or persons and on such terms and for such consideration (so far as may be permitted by law) as the board of directors in its absolute discretion may deem advisable. The provisions of this section (C) shall not impair any conversion right of any such convertible securities or any other right authorized by the board of directors to purchase or exchange, or to receive any distribution of, any securities of the corporation.
 
(1) Subject to the voting rights of holders of Preferred Stock as may be established pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this Article 4, the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to vote, and to vote as separate classes, upon the authorization of any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation, and, in addition to the authorization of any such amendment by vote of a majority of the total number of votes represented by all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, the amendment shall be authorized by vote of a majority of the total number of votes represented by all outstanding shares of the Class A Common Stock and/or the Common Stock if such amendment contains any provision which would:

The holders of shares of a class or series shall be entitled to vote and to vote as a class if the plan of merger or consolidation contains any provision which, if contained in an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, would entitle the holders of shares of such class or series to vote and vote as a class thereon pursuant to subsection (D)(1) of this Article 4. In such case, in addition to the authorization of the plan of merger or consolidation by vote of two-thirds of the total number of votes represented by all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, the plan of merger or consolidation shall be authorized by vote of the majority of the total number of votes represented by all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. Any plan of merger or consolidation of any subsidiary corporation or corporations, whether domestic or foreign, with and into the corporation shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection (D)(2) if the corporation owns at least ninety percent of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of such subsidiary corporation or corporations.
For the purposes of this subsection (D)(2), the financial or other effect of any merger or consolidation on the corporation shall not be deemed to affect adversely the powers, preferences or rights of any class or series of stock.

On July 17, 2009, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's second quarter earnings. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
The following exhibit is being filed herewith:
(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated July 17, 2009.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated July 17, 2009
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
July 17, 2009
A. O. Smith announces second quarter results exceeding analysts' estimates; company increases and narrows annual guidance
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced second quarter net earnings of $21.3 million or $0.84 per share on sales of $498.7 million. Included in earnings was a positive tax adjustment of $1.9 million relating to its Chinese water products business.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The reported results have been impacted by required accounting related to the company's transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed on April 22. For accounting purposes, the former controlling shareholder, SICO, is treated as the acquirer even though the company is the surviving corporation. Current period and prior period earnings and earnings per share amounts reported by A. O. Smith in its SEC filings will include activity of SICO prior to the closing date. The primary accounting impact of the SICO transaction is in the calculation of earnings per share because the accounting rules require the use of SICO shares outstanding rather than A. O. Smith shares outstanding prior to closing. Eliminating the impact of this transaction, non-GAAP earnings were $23.7 million or $0.79 per share for the second quarter of 2009.
The company believes that providing non-GAAP information is beneficial to investors in understanding the current and historical operations of the company. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share calculations is shown at the end of this press release. Future quarterly financial statements will not be affected by the transaction, however, we will provide non-GAAP financial information for historical comparison purposes.
 
The following tables contain both the GAAP and the Non-GAAP information for the second quarter and the first six months:
 
 
Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were 498.7 million, approximately 20 percent lower than the 2008 second quarter. The decline in sales was due to lower demand in all of the company's North American end markets, reflecting cautious customer spending caused by the global recession. However, sales and earnings in the second quarter were an improvement from the first quarter of this year.
$
"Given the current economic environment, both of our operating units performed well in the second quarter due to aggressive cost management and a relatively strong replacement market," said Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer. "Equally important was that cash flow from continuing operations during the first half of this year, which totaled almost $94 million, was a significant improvement from the $20.3 million generated during the first half of last year."
 
Water Products
Second quarter sales in the company's Water Products operation were $337.1 million, or 11 percent lower than the same period in 2008. The lower sales reflected the continuing softness in the domestic housing market as well as a slow-down in the commercial water heater market segment. After a weak first quarter 2009, water heater sales in China improved due to the positive impact of the economic stimulus programs instituted by the Chinese government earlier this year.
Operating profit of $36.5 million was modestly higher than the second quarter of 2008. Operating margins improved to 10.8 percent for the quarter compared with 9.5 percent achieved last year as a result of aggressive cost reduction programs and higher pricing.
Electrical Products
Sales of electric motors declined approximately 33 percent to $162.4 million compared with second quarter 2008 sales of $242.4 million. Volumes were lower in all of the company's major market segments due to the global recession.
Electrical Products' operating profit in the second quarter was $7.6 million compared with $22.5 million earned in the second quarter of 2008. The significantly lower volumes contributed to the earnings decrease but were partially offset by cost savings realized from Electrical Products company's product repositioning initiatives implemented last year.
New product initiatives
"We continue to pursue new product opportunities and invest in our business to enhance our market position, which will ensure we are well positioned when the global economy recovers," Jones commented. Among the new product introductions during the second quarter are:
 
 
 
 
Outlook
"We do not foresee a recovery in U. S. residential new construction during the remainder of 2009, and we expect weakened commercial demand to continue," Jones said. "We are experiencing a modest seasonal uptick in the HVAC market as customers replenish inventories, but we expect this trend to be short-lived."
"Our operating units have performed well despite tremendously difficult market conditions, and we continue to conserve cash and reduce costs throughout the organization. Due, in large part, to the success of our cost management efforts and sequential improvement in our second quarter earnings, we are increasing and narrowing our full-year earnings outlook to between $2.15 and $2.35 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.05 and $2.25 per share, on a non-GAAP basis."
Conference Call
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

On October 16, 2009, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's third quarter earnings. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share. Management uses this non-GAAP information for all internal purposes of reporting results of operations, including return on investment measures utilized in determining certain incentive-based compensation and employee profit sharing amounts.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated October 16, 2009
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
October 16, 2009
A. O. Smith reports record third quarter earnings of $1.14 per share; exceeding analysts' estimates
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced third quarter net earnings of $34.6 million or $1.14 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates. Included in earnings was a $3.0 million non-taxable net gain associated with the sale of a motor manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, China, and a $1.5 million tax benefit resulting from the closure of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns. Collectively, these adjustments added $0.15 cents per share to third quarter results.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Strong growth in China, aggressive cost reduction throughout the organization, and a temporary decline in raw material costs contributed to the improved earnings. Sales in the third quarter of $501.5 million were approximately 17 percent lower than sales in the same period last year.
"Our expense reduction programs are having the desired impact on our financial performance," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Our company has performed well despite tough economic conditions, and I am pleased to report we expect to generate between $190 and $200 million in operating cash flow this year compared to $107 million last year."
Water Products
Third quarter sales of $336.7 million were approximately 10 percent lower than the same period in 2008, as Water Products continued to experience the effect of the U.S. housing market slow-down and reduced commercial construction activity. Third quarter water heater sales in China increased over 35 percent as a result of improved consumer confidence, success with new residential and commercial products, and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating profit of $38.7 million was approximately 18 percent higher than 2008 third quarter operating profit of $32.8 million. Water Products Company benefited from higher-margin China volumes, its continued cost reduction activities, and lower steel costs. Operating margin improved to 11.5 percent compared with 8.8 percent for the third quarter of 2008.
 
Electrical Products
Electrical Products third quarter sales declined approximately 29 percent to $165.9 million compared with the same period one year ago. Sales of electric motors continue to be adversely affected by the slow-down in residential housing construction in the U.S. and global commercial construction markets.
Operating profit in the third quarter was $22.8 million, significantly higher than the $10.6 million earned in the 2008 third quarter, which included $2.1 million in pre-tax restructuring charges. The company continued to benefit from the restructuring initiatives completed in 2008 as well as ongoing expense reduction actions and lower raw material costs. A $3.0 million net gain associated with the sale of a plant in China and a $2.2 million LIFO benefit from reduced inventory levels also contributed to Electrical Products' profit improvement. Third quarter operating margin was 13.7 percent compared with 4.6 percent for the same period last year.
Water treatment venture
On Sept. 17, A. O. Smith announced it had signed an agreement to purchase a majority interest in the water treatment business of Tianlong Holding Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong. A newly formed company, A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd., will hold the assets of the business and supply reverse osmosis water filtration products to the China residential and commercial markets as well as export markets throughout the world. The two companies anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter.
"Entering the global water treatment industry is an important strategic initiative for A. O. Smith, and, in Tianlong, we are acquiring the market leader in China reverse osmosis residential water purification," Jones said. Within 12 months of the close of the transaction, A. O. Smith plans to introduce a line of water treatment products in China to be sold under the A. O. Smith brand name. "The high quality products made by Tianlong are a perfect match for our well-known A. O. Smith branded products, which are currently sold in over 2,000 retail stores in China," Jones pointed out. "We expect the new venture will earn in excess of its cost of capital in its first full year of operation under A. O. Smith ownership."
 
Smith Investment transaction impact to reported results
The 2008 and 2009 nine-month and third quarter 2008 results were impacted by required GAAP accounting related to the company's previously announced transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed April 22, 2009.

Outlook
"Based on our performance through the first three quarters of this year, we are increasing 2009 guidance," Jones commented. "We now forecast A. O. Smith's full-year earnings will be between $2.95 and $3.10 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.60 and $2.75 per share on a non-GAAP basis."
"We remain concerned about the economic recovery, particularly in the housing and commercial construction markets, and by significant increases in raw material costs in the last few months," Jones cautioned. "These factors will continue to present challenges to our operating units as we conclude the year."

Exhibit 99.1
      November 24, 2009
A. O. Smith concludes purchase of Tianlong Holding Co. Ltd. water treatment business
A. O. Smith Corporation today announced A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co., Ltd., concluded its purchase of the water treatment business of Tianlong Holding Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong.
Milwaukee, Wis.
A. O. Smith holds 80 percent of the newly formed company, which is considered a wholly owned foreign enterprise under Chinese law. A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd., will supply reverse osmosis water purification products to the China residential and commercial markets as well as export markets throughout the world.
"This is an important strategic action that we believe will benefit A. O. Smith and its shareholders," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones said. "This puts A. O. Smith squarely in the rapidly growing global water treatment industry."
"We are very excited about working closely with our new partner and the Tianlong team," he continued. "Tianlong brings extensive experience and knowledge of the market to this new venture along with a strong customer base. We expect this rapidly growing business to generate sales of more than $75 million in 2010 with operating margins in the upper teens, excluding purchase accounting charges. We expect the acquisition will add between $0.10 and $0.15 to A. O. Smith's 2010 earnings per share."
In 2010, A. O. Smith will introduce a line of water purification products in China to be sold under the A. O. Smith brand name through the company's current water heater distribution channels.
Founded in 1999, Tianlong employs more than 900 people in two facilities totaling approximately 40,000 square meters (431,000 square feet) in Shanghai. The company, China's leading manufacturer of residential and commercial water purification equipment, supplies reverse osmosis appliances, reverse osmosis elements, water softeners, industrial and commercial water treatment equipment, filters, and components.

Exhibit 99.1
January 26, 2010
A. O. Smith reports record earnings per share for 2009
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced the achievement of record earnings per share in 2009 in spite of lower revenues caused by the lingering housing crisis, a weak commercial construction market, and the global recession. Sales in 2009 were $2.0 billion, 14 percent lower than 2008 sales of $2.3 billion.
Milwaukee, Wis.
For the year, the company earned $81.3 million or $3.39 per share. Non-GAAP earnings, adjusted for the effect of the Smith Investment Company transaction which closed in April 2009, were $89.7 million, or $2.96 per share, 10 percent higher than non-GAAP earnings of $81.9 million or $2.70 per share earned in 2008. Growth in higher-margin China sales, aggressive cost management, lower raw material costs, and lower restructuring costs contributed to the improved results. Additionally, the company generated record cash flow from operations in 2009 of $267.6 million.
The company earned $22.7 million or $.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with non-GAAP earnings of $6.7 million or $.22 per share earned in the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2009 sales were $509.6 million, essentially flat compared with 2008 fourth quarter sales of $508.6 million.
"Our company and our employees performed extremely well under difficult circumstances last year," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones said. "We recognized the onset of the global recession early, made the difficult decisions necessary to address the expected impact on the company, and then stuck by those decisions. The expense reduction and cash conservation programs we put in place had the desired effect, helping us maintain our profitability and generate significant cash flow throughout the year."
"Our employees deserve a lot of credit for finding countless ways to reduce expenses and generate cash while remaining focused on our customers," Jones added.
 
Water Products Company
Water Products sales decreased approximately five percent to $1.38 billion compared with 2008 sales of $1.45 billion. Lower sales of residential and commercial water heaters in the U. S. were partially offset by a 19 percent sales increase in China to more than $219 million.
Operating profit increased 11 percent to $148.9 million compared with profit of $134.7 million in 2008. Growth in China sales, aggressive cost management, and lower raw material costs contributed to the higher profits. Operating margin increased to 10.8 percent compared with 9.3 percent in 2008.
In the fourth quarter, Water Products sales of $362.2 million were approximately five percent higher than 2008 fourth quarter sales of $346.2 million, primarily the result of a 32 percent increase in China sales. Fourth quarter 2009 operating profit was $44.5 million, more than 50 percent higher than the $29.6 million profit for the same period in 2008, as a result of China sales growth, aggressive cost reduction programs, and lower raw material costs. Operating margin was 12.3 percent, an increase over the fourth quarter 2008 margin of 8.6 percent.
On Nov. 24, 2009, A. O. Smith concluded its purchase of 80 percent of the water treatment business of Tianlong Holding Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong. The newly formed company, A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co., Ltd., will supply reverse osmosis water purification products to the China residential and commercial markets, as well as export markets throughout the world. A. O. Smith expects the new business to add between $0.10 and $0.15 to 2010 earnings per share.
Electrical Products
Sales in 2009 for Electrical Products decreased by 28 percent to $620.4 million as the weakened domestic housing market and the slowdown in the global commercial construction market reduced demand in all of its major market segments. Operating profit in 2009 declined to $32.5 million compared with $39.1 million in 2008. Aggressive cost reduction programs, lower raw material costs, and repositioning savings partially offset the significant impact of lower sales. The 2009 operating profit included restructuring income of $1.6 million primarily associated with the sale of a plant in China and an incremental $6.6 million LIFO benefit net of lower absorption of fixed costs associated with significant inventory reductions compared with 2008. Earnings in 2008 included $8.7 million of restructuring expense. Operating margin increased to 5.2 percent compared with 2008 operating margin of 4.6 percent.
 
In the fourth quarter, Electrical Products reported sales of $148.4 million, approximately nine percent lower than fourth quarter 2008 sales of $163.2 million. The weak housing market and soft global commercial construction activity contributed to the sales decline. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was $5.1 million compared with a loss of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of cost reduction programs implemented early in 2009, lower raw material costs, and net LIFO benefit of $6.4 million. Fourth quarter 2008 earnings included restructuring charges of $2.9 million. Fourth quarter 2009 operating margin was 3.4 percent.
Cash flow and leverage
Record cash flow from operating activities in 2009 of $267.6 million was more than double the $98.4 million in cash generated in 2008. The strong focus on reducing working capital, most notably inventory reductions and improved accounts payable terms in China, drove the cash flow improvement. The company's debt-to-capital ratio at the end of 2009 decreased to 24 percent from 34 percent at the end of 2008 despite the $77 million purchase price for the water treatment business in the fourth quarter. The company reduced debt by almost $100 million during the year.
Outlook
"There are a number of positive trends going into 2010, most notably continued growth in China and the start up of manufacturing in India, a full year of our new water treatment business, and evidence of improved demand in many of our global motor markets," Jones said. "But, we remain cautious because of continued weakness in new commercial construction activity and rising commodity costs," "Consequently, we expect earnings per share will range from $2.95 to $3.25 in 2010."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
 
Smith Investment transaction impact to reported results
The 2008 and 2009 full year and fourth quarter 2008 results were impacted by required GAAP accounting related to the company's previously announced transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed April 22, 2009. The fourth quarter 2009 results were not impacted by the transaction. The company believes that providing non-GAAP information is beneficial to investors in understanding the current and historical operations of the company. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share calculations is shown as part of the financial statements that accompany this release. Future quarterly financial statements will not be affected by the transaction; however, the company will provide non-GAAP financial information for historical comparison purposes.

Exhibit 99.1
    April 20, 2010
A. O. Smith reports record first quarter earnings of $1.01 per share
.A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced record first quarter earnings of $1.01 per share on an increase in sales of approximately nine percent.
Milwaukee, Wis
First quarter 2010 earnings of $30.9 million or $1.01 per share were higher than the $2.7 million or $0.28 per share reported during the same period in 2009. Non-GAAP earnings in 2009, adjusted for the effect of the Smith Investment Company transaction which closed in April 2009, were $8.7 million or $0.29 per share. Sales for the quarter ended March 31 increased 8.7 percent to $523.4 million compared with first quarter 2009 sales of $481.6 million.
The company's record first quarter results were due to significant water heater sales growth in China, increased electric motor volumes, lower operating costs throughout the business, and lower raw material costs compared with the first quarter of last year. The previous first quarter earnings record of $.72 per share was set in 2008.
"The economic recovery in China and new product introductions have helped stimulate water heater sales in that important market," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones said. "In addition, many customers in our global motor markets began to replenish inventories in the first quarter which positively impacted motor sales."
"As a result of the strong first quarter performance, in March we increased our earnings guidance for 2010 to range between $3.20 and $3.40 per share," Jones commented. "Although there are a number of reasons to be cautious, including the health of the domestic residential and commercial construction markets and the seemingly relentless march upward in raw material costs, we are confident we can manage through these challenges and achieve our profit goals for the year."
 
Water Products Company
Water Products first quarter sales increased approximately eight percent to $366.7 million compared with first quarter 2009 sales of $339.0 million. The growth in sales was driven primarily by higher water heater sales in China and Canada.
Operating profit increased almost 51 percent to $43.9 million in the first quarter, the result of the higher sales in China and Canada, lower operating costs, and lower raw material costs. Operating margin in the first quarter was 12.0 percent compared with first quarter 2009 operating margin of 8.6 percent.
Earlier this month, Water Products announced one of the largest new product introductions in its history featuring four new energy-efficient residential product lines. The launch includes:
 
 
 
 
"We are excited about the improvements in energy efficiency that these products will provide to our residential customers," Jones said. "All will qualify for a combination of the federal tax credit and various state and utility rebates, making the value proposition even more appealing."
Water Products will also begin production this month of residential water heaters designed specifically for India at its new water heater plant near Bangalore, India. A. O. Smith is the first U. S- based company to market residential water heaters in India.
Electrical Products
First quarter 2010 sales increased to $157.8 million compared with first quarter 2009 sales of $143.6 million. The almost 10 percent increase in sales was the result of improved demand in all of the company's markets globally, as well as customers replenishing depleted motor inventories during the first quarter in North America.
 
Electrical Products reported first quarter operating profit of $14.3 million compared with a loss in the first quarter of 2009. The higher volumes, lower operating costs, and global cost reduction activities contributed to the significant improvement in first quarter profit. First quarter operating margin was 9.1 percent.
Electrical Products announced it has secured several new HVAC accounts for its energy efficient electronically commutated variable speed motor (ECM) technology. The company expects to continue to ramp up production of motors featuring this technology in the residential and light commercial OEM market. Last year, Electrical Products began supplying variable speed pump motors into the leisure market in North America for applications in swimming pool and spa pumps, and the company is forecasting accelerated unit growth in 2010.
Outlook
"The first quarter provides further evidence that our business is continuing to recover in spite of the ongoing weakness in the domestic residential and commercial construction markets. China remains a bright spot, and we expect additional contributions later this year from our seasonal electric motor business," Jones said. "We expect the positive trends will outweigh the uncertainties caused by volatile commodity costs and consequently believe earnings will range between $3.20 and $3.40 per share in 2010."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit 99.1
July 20, 2010
A. O. Smith announces improved second quarter operating results before $.68 per share charge for flood-related costs
Water heater and electric motor manufacturer A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today reported second quarter earnings of $16.6 million or $.54 per share, including a one-time pre-tax charge of $34.2 million or $.68 per share associated with flood damage at its Ashland City, Tenn., facility.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Earnings for the same quarter last year were $21.3 million or $.84 per share. Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter 2009, excluding the impact of the SICO transaction, were $23.7 million or $.79 per share.
Second quarter sales of $572.5 million were nearly 15 percent higher than sales of $498.7 million for the same period last year.
"We are pleased with the outstanding performance achieved by both operating segments in the second quarter," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Electrical Products, in particular, recorded impressive sales and operating profit gains, with operating margins of 13.1 percent."
"At the same time, we have made remarkable progress recovering from the disastrous flood in Ashland City," Jones continued. "Our Water Products team performed selflessly during the difficult and complicated process to bring the facility back on line since May 3 and continues to work diligently to restore Ashland City while serving our customers. I also want to thank our customers for their patience and support during the last couple of months."
Water Products
Water Products Company's second quarter sales increased approximately 11 percent over last year to $374.9 million, bolstered by higher sales globally, particularly in China and Canada.
 
Operating profits in the second quarter were $7.8 million compared with $36.5 million recorded last year, as the contribution from higher overall global volumes was more than offset by $34.2 million in one-time expenses related to the flood in Ashland City. The flood-related expenses are after the recovery of approximately $32 million in property insurance.
Water Products Company's second quarter results included $9.3 million in sales from the company's new water purification business in China. The progress of the new business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges, and the company now expects its water purification business to break even in 2010. The company continues to expect strong long-term opportunities in the water purification industry in China and plans to introduce an A. O. Smith branded line of water purification products for the China retail segment during the third quarter.
On July 1, the company created a joint venture with Takagi Industrial Co. Ltd. of Fuji-city, Shizuoka, Japan, to market and manufacture tankless water heaters in North America. As part of the venture, A. O. Smith is taking over management of Takagi's North American sales and distribution organization.
"This venture represents an important opportunity for A. O. Smith to expand our offering of high efficiency water heating products and to participate in the growing North American tankless market," commented Jones.
Electrical Products
Second quarter sales at the Electrical Products Company increased approximately 22 percent over last year to $198.3 million. Motor sales were higher in all of the company's major market segments, most notably its North American residential heating and air conditioning market, as demand for customer replacement motors and hermetic motors for residential compressors was strong.
Operating profit improved substantially to $25.9 million compared with profits of $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. The improved profits were due to higher volumes, lower operating costs, ongoing process improvement activities, and higher sales of new products. Operating margin in the quarter was 13.1 percent compared with the 4.7 percent margin reported in the second quarter last year.
"The performance of our Electrical Products group through the second quarter is outstanding," Jones said. "We are seeing the positive results of the excellent execution of our roadmap to higher profitability, which has been our focus over the last few years and
 
will continue. Plants were closed, products were rationalized, and manufacturing processes were streamlined both before and during the economic downturn. We are grateful to all our dedicated employees who contributed in so many ways to this achievement"
.
Sales of new products continued to accelerate in the second quarter, particularly high efficiency motors for the HVAC and pump industries. Also, the company's commercial hermetic motor facilities in Asia posted stronger sales than expected and higher sales than last year.
Outlook
"Our operating outlook remains strong, as does the demand for our products. As we look forward, we are cautious about the fragile nature of the global recovery, and we recognize the seasonality of our motor business," Jones said. "Our 2010 full-year earnings estimate, including the one-time charge for the flood, is a range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
Smith Investment transaction impact to reported results
The 2009 second quarter and six month results reflect the impact of the required GAAP accounting related to the company's previously announced transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed April 22, 2009. The company believes that providing non-GAAP earnings information is beneficial to investors in understanding the historical operations of the company. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share calculations is shown as part of the financial statements that accompany this release. Future quarterly financial statements will not be affected by the transaction; however, the company will provide non-GAAP financial information for historical comparison purposes. The following tables contain both the GAAP and the Non-GAAP information:
 
 
Forward-looking statements
This release contains statements that the company believes are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "guidance" or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release. Factors that could cause such a variance include the following: significant volatility in raw material prices; competitive pressures on the company's businesses; inability to implement pricing actions; negative impact of future pension contributions on the company's ability to generate cash flow; instability in the company's electric motor and water products markets; further weakening in housing construction; further weakening in commercial construction; timing of any recoveries in housing or commercial construction; a slowdown in the Chinese economy; further adverse changes in customer liquidity and general economic and capital market conditions; the impact of acquisition accounting or non-GAAP financial measures on the company's financial statements; difficulties in integrating the China acquisition or the North American tankless water heater joint venture; difficulties in realizing future growth and profit expectations for the China acquisition or the North American tankless joint venture and potential negative impacts on the company that the flooding of its Ashland City, Tenn., water heater manufacturing plant may have. Forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date of this release, and the company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributed to the company, or persons acting on its behalf, are qualified entirely by these cautionary statements.

Exhibit 99.1
October 19, 2010
A. O. Smith reports third quarter earnings of $1.04 per share, exceeding analyst expectations; raises 2010 guidance to between $3.25 and $3.35 per share
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced third quarter earnings of $32.0 million or $1.04 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates for the quarter.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Earnings reported for the same period last year were $34.6 million or $1.14 per share. The 2009 earnings included approximately $4.5 million in gains related to the sale of a manufacturing plant in China and closure of 2005 and 2006 income tax returns which collectively added $.15 to per share earnings.
Sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $559.4 million, an 11.5 percent increase over third quarter 2009 sales of $501.5 million.
"Our operating units continue to perform well in an uncertain economic environment," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Electrical Products and Water Products both increased sales by over 10 percent during the quarter, when compared with the same period last year. Our China water heater operations enjoyed another strong quarter thanks to new product introductions and market share gains. And our hermetic motor operations in China experienced double digit revenue gains."
"I am also pleased with the speed of Ashland, Tenn.'s recovery after the disastrous flooding in May. The company has received all insurance proceeds and our team expects to return to pre-flood efficiency levels by the end of this year. Equally important, thanks to the entire Water Products' team, we were able to satisfy customer demand during the flood recovery period."
For the first nine months of 2010, A. O. Smith earned $79.5 million or $2.59 per share which includes a $34.2 million or $.68 per share charge associated with the flood damages in Ashland City. During the same period in 2009, earnings were $58.6 million or $2.69 per share and on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the SICO transaction, were $67.0 million or $2.21 per share. A reconciliation of the adjustments to earnings is included at the end of this press release. Sales for the first nine months of 2010 were $1.66 billion compared with $1.48 billion during the same period last year, an increase of almost 12 percent.
 
Water Products
Third quarter sales at the Water Products Company, which includes residential and commercial water heaters and water purification equipment, were $377.5 million, 12.1 percent higher than third quarter 2009 sales of $336.7 million. Contributing to the increase were higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in North America and a nearly 30 percent sales increase in China.
Third quarter operating profit was $37.6 million, a decline of 2.8 percent from last year due to higher steel costs as well as increased costs and continuing inefficiencies resulting from the May flood in Ashland City. A price increase, which became effective in August, partially offset the impact from higher steel costs during the third quarter. Operating margin in the quarter was 10.0 percent compared with operating margin of 11.5 percent last year.
Electrical Products
Electrical Products Company sales of $183.3 million represented a 10.5 percent increase over third quarter 2009 sales of $165.9 million. During the quarter, the company reported sales increases in most of its major market segments. Sales of hermetic motors in China were particularly strong, experiencing double digit gains compared with the same quarter last year.
Operating profit of $21.7 million was $1.1 million lower than the $22.8 million earned during the same period in 2009. Earnings from higher volumes and pricing actions were partially offset by higher steel costs. In addition, last year's operating profit included a $3.0 million gain resulting from the sale of a plant in China and a $2.2 million LIFO benefit. Electrical Products' operating margin in the third quarter was 11.8 percent compared with 13.7 percent in last year's third quarter.
Outlook
"The underlying strength in the replacement demand for our products continues to bolster our sales, and our recovery from the flood has been remarkable," Jones said. "However, the summer selling season is over and our HVAC and swimming pool pump OEM customers normally reduce their order volumes in the fourth quarter to adjust their inventories. We expect this year will be no different. In addition, we are experiencing increases in raw material prices, particularly copper and steel, which is another reason to be cautious."
 
 
"Nonetheless, as a result of the strength of our businesses through the third quarter tempered by an uncertain economic and political climate going forward, we are raising our 2010 full-year earnings estimate to between $3.25 to $3.35 per share, which includes the $.68 per share charge associated with the second quarter flood." The full year earnings estimate is based on the number of outstanding shares prior to the impact of the 3-for-2 stock split, which was announced last week.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
Smith Investment transaction impact to reported results
The 2009 nine month results reflect the impact of the required GAAP accounting related to the company's previously announced transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed April 22, 2009. The company believes that providing non-GAAP earnings information is beneficial to investors in understanding the historical operations of the company.

On November 12, 2010, A. O. Smith Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, A.O. Smith Enterprises Ltd. (the "Canadian Borrower"), A.O. Smith International Holdings B.V. (the "Dutch Borrower"), the financial institutions parties thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company's existing $425 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program are supported by the Credit Agreement. The Company intends to use the new revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that matures on November 12, 2013. The initial maximum aggregate amount of availability under the revolving credit facility is $425 million, of which approximately $201 million was drawn as of November 12, 2010. Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit, of which none were outstanding as of November 12, 2010. The Company may increase the maximum aggregate amount of availability under the revolving credit facility to up to $525 million if certain conditions are satisfied, including the absence of any event of default or default under the Credit Agreement and the Company obtaining the consent of the lenders participating in the increase.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, which will be adjusted based on the Company's Leverage Ratio (as defined below), or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin, which will be adjusted based on the Company's Leverage Ratio. The Company must also pay (1) a facility fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.45% per annum (based on the Company's Leverage Ratio) on the amount of each lender's commitment and (2) a participation fee ranging from 1.325% to 2.30% per annum (based on the Company's Leverage Ratio) of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and, with certain exceptions, its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, the Company may not permit (1) the ratio of its consolidated funded debt to the sum of its consolidated funded debt plus its consolidated stockholders' equity as of the end of any fiscal quarter (the "Leverage Ratio") to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and (2) the ratio of its consolidated net income (excluding extraordinary gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash charges and income ("EBITDA") for the four fiscal quarters then ended to its consolidated interest expense, including yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations (if any), for the same period to be less than 3.5 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions during the period to which such calculation relates.
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. However, certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company will unconditionally guarantee the Company's obligations from time to time arising under the Credit Agreement, and the Company will unconditionally guarantee the obligations of the Canadian Borrower and the Dutch Borrower under the Credit Agreement to the extent that the Canadian Borrower and/or the Dutch Borrower borrow directly under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Company or any of its material subsidiaries becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.
 
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

(b) If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount of any Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on a Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to the applicable Borrower such amount, such Lender shall on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at (in the case of amounts in U.S. Dollars) the Federal Funds Rate or (in the case of amounts in Canadian Dollars) the Canadian Cost of Funds Rate.

The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to ) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the applicable Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. The Lenders may, without the consent of any Borrower or any other Person, make arrangements among themselves to amend or otherwise modify this to establish different sharing arrangements with respect to payments by or on behalf of the Borrowers; that any such amendment, modification or sharing arrangement shall be consented to by all Lenders.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company and the Dutch Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Company or the Dutch Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Company or the Dutch Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Company or the Dutch Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Loans.

3.6 . Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation under this shall deliver to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prior to or contemporaneously with any demand for payment under this , a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and a computation of the amount payable to, such Lender, and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, any Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution method. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no amount shall be payable by a Borrower pursuant to or with respect to any period commencing more than 180 days before the delivery of the certificate contemplated by this unless such amount is claimed as a result of the retroactive effect of any newly enacted or adopted law, rule or regulation and such certificate is delivered within 180 days after such enactment or adoption.

In this opinion Dutch legal concepts are expressed in English terms and not in their original Dutch terms. Where indicated in underlined italics, Dutch equivalents of these English terms have been given. The Dutch legal concepts may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions.

We express no opinion as to any laws other than Dutch law in force as at the date hereof as applied and interpreted according to present duly and in paper form published case law of the Dutch courts, administrative rulings and authoritative literature and no opinion is given that the future or continued performance of the Company's obligations or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents will not contravene these laws, application or interpretation, as changed from time to time.
We do not give any opinion on any matters of fact (including but not limited to statements, covenants and representations and warranties as made by the Company in or contained in any of the documents reviewed by us), tax law or other levies, anti trust law, treaties or international law (including the laws of the European Union, except if and when such treaties and/or the laws of the European Union have direct effect in the Netherlands at the date hereof, and except to the extent as specifically stated otherwise). Where an assumption is made, we have not investigated the matters that are the subject of such assumption, except to the extent expressly stated otherwise.
The opinions contained in this letter are strictly limited to the matters stated below under the heading Opinions' and do not extend by implication or otherwise to any other matter not specifically referred to. These opinions are rendered as at the date hereof only and we are under no obligation to update our opinions for events, transactions, circumstances or changes in any of the facts, assumptions or representations occurring after the date hereof or for any other reason.
Opinions
Based upon the foregoing (including the assumptions set out above) and subject to any factual matters or documents not disclosed to us in the course of our investigation, and subject to the qualifications and limitations contained herein, we are, as at the date and hour hereof, of the opinion that:
 
The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing under the laws of the Netherlands as a legal entity in the form of a private company with limited liability ().
besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid
 
The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into the Opinion Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder.
 
The Company has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize its entry into the Opinion Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder.
 
The Opinion Documents have been duly executed by the Company and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
The entering into by the Company of the Opinion Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder do not (a) violate any provision of applicable Dutch law which would render the Opinion Documents null and void or subject the Opinion Documents to nullification or avoidance, or (b) conflict with or result in a breach of or violation under the Articles.
 
No license, permission, consent, approval, any other action by, or filing or registration with, any Dutch governmental authority is required for, or in connection with, the entering into by the Company of the Opinion Documents and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder or to make the Opinion Documents admissible in evidence in the Netherlands.
 
No Dutch stamp duties () with respect to the signing, execution and delivery of the Opinion Documents will be imposed upon any of the parties thereto.

Qualifications
The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications:
Insolvency laws and other laws affecting enforceability
(A) The opinions expressed herein may be affected or limited by the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, voidable preference (reorganization, suspension of payments, other or similar laws of general application now or hereafter in effect (including but not limited to the laws that apply pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation), relating to or affecting the enforcement or protection of creditors' rights, and any emergency measures that may be taken by the Dutch authorities under the Dutch Financial Relations Emergency Act ().

Power and authority
(B) The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Company under the Opinion Documents may be successfully contested by the Company (or its receiver in bankruptcy ()) on the basis of Section 2:7 Dutch Civil Code, if both (i) the execution of the Opinion Documents is not within the scope of the object of the Company () and (ii) the counterparty of the Company under the Opinion Documents knew or ought to have known (without enquiry) of this fact. The Dutch Supreme Court () has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity are violated, not only the description of such objects in the articles of association is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the interests of the legal entity were served by the transaction. As this is largely dependent on factual matters, we are not in a position to opine on this issue. However, in this respect we note that (i) the objects clause () in the Articles allows the entering into by the Company of agreements or documents such as the Opinion Documents, and (ii) although not constituting conclusive evidence thereof, the Board has confirmed in the Board Resolution that it deems the entering into, signing, execution, delivery and performance of the Opinion Documents to be in the Company's corporate interest () and conducive to the realization of and useful in connection with the Company's corporate objects ().

(C) It should be noted that if a party to the Opinion Documents is controlled by or otherwise connected with a person, organization or country which is currently the subject of United Nations, European Union or Dutch sanctions, implemented, effective or sanctioned in the Netherlands under the Sanctions Act 1977 (), the General Customs Act () or the Economic Offences Act (), or is otherwise subject to any such sanctions, the Opinion Documents may be unenforceable or void or otherwise affected. Furthermore, effective as of February 1, 2007, a provision has been incorporated in Section 2:20 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code, pursuant to which any legal entity listed on the list referred to in Section 2 paragraph 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism, in Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) No. 881/2002 of 27 May 2002, or is listed and marked with a star in the Annex to Council Common Position No. 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism, is prohibited by operation of law and is not authorized to perform legal acts. Consequently, if a party to the Opinion Documents is listed on such lists or in such Annexes, the Opinion Documents may be unenforceable or void or otherwise affected.

(D) Under the laws of the Netherlands, each power of attorney () or mandate () whether or not irrevocable, granted by the Company, will terminate by operation of law (), without any notice, upon bankruptcy of the Company and will cease to be effective in the event of a suspension of payments. It should also be noted that the granting of a power of attorney, even when such power of attorney is made irrevocable, does not have as a consequence that the person granting the power of attorney is not authorized to act itself ().

Exhibit 99.1
December 13, 2010
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE: AOS) announced today it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Electrical Products Company, an operating segment that is one of the largest manufacturers of electric motors for residential and commercial applications in North America, to Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE:RBC) for approximately $875 million, comprised of $700 million in cash and approximately 2.83 million shares of Regal Beloit common stock (having a market value of approximately $175 million based on the 10 day trailing average stock price). The transaction, which has been approved by both companies' boards of directors, is expected to close in the first half of 2011.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Commenting on the timing and the merits of the transaction, A. O. Smith Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones said, "The electric motor industry has been undergoing a significant transformation over the last several years due to global consolidation and the emergence of a number of international competitors. The consolidation in the marketplace, which has accelerated this year, prompted us to evaluate the potential sale of our motor business, with the expectation that we would reinvest the proceeds into high growth opportunities."
"We are very excited about the prospects of Electrical Products combining with Regal Beloit. We have tremendous respect for their organization and feel they are a world class company. While we received strong interest from a number of companies, Regal Beloit's proposal provided the best value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. Regal Beloit has a long-standing track record for excellence in the manufacturing of mechanical and electric motion control and power generation products. Aligning our Electrical Products division with Regal Beloit will afford our customers and employees a platform with the size, scope, and global presence needed to be competitive in this dynamic market," Jones continued.
"This transaction is strong evidence of our Electrical Products team's success at structuring and operating this business to maximize profitability, even during the recently difficult market environment. Four years ago, they identified a roadmap for improvement, diligently stuck to that roadmap, and re-emerged as a much stronger business with substantially higher operating margins," Jones said.
With the sale of its electrical products business, A. O. Smith Corporation's core business will be manufacturing residential and commercial water heating equipment and water purification equipment, which reported sales of $1.1 billion for the first nine months of 2010. The company remains committed to building on its leadership in the water heating equipment business, continuing to offer a comprehensive product line featuring the best-known brands in North America and China.
Commenting on the use of proceeds from the proposed sale of its electrical products business, Jones said, "We intend to use these proceeds to explore opportunities in high growth markets and expansion into new geographies and adjacent technologies that complement our manufacturing, engineering, and distribution strengths, with an emphasis on water-related technologies."
Regal Beloit Corporation, headquartered in Beloit, Wisconsin, is a leading manufacturer of mechanical and electrical motion control and power generation products serving markets throughout the world. Regal Beloit has manufacturing, sales, and service facilities throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Asia.
A. O. Smith Electrical Products Company manufactures an extensive line of fractional horsepower, integral horsepower, and hermetic motors for residential, and commercial applications. For the first nine months of 2010, the division reported operating earnings of $61.9 million on sales of $539.4 million. Headquartered in Tipp
City, Ohio, the electric motor division employs approximately 7,800 people at 20 manufacturing plants in the United States, Mexico, China, and England. The division also has distribution centers in the United States and sales/distribution offices in Singapore and Dubai.
The sale is conditioned upon customary terms and conditions as well as the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other governmental approvals. The two parties expect to close on the transaction in the first half of 2011. There are no financing conditions to the transaction.
Greenhill & Co. acted as financial advisor to A. O. Smith. Latham & Watkins LLP acted as counsel to the Company.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call to discuss the transaction at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) on Monday, December 13, 2010. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated January 25, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
January 25, 2011
A. O. Smith announces record earnings for 2010 and provides 2011 guidance
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) reported 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $57.3 million or $1.24 per share on sales of $1.49 billion, which included an after-tax charge of $21.6 million, or $0.47 per share, associated with the flooding that impacted the company's Ashland City, Tenn., facility in May. The discontinued Electrical Products operations earned $54.4 million or $1.18 per share on sales of $705.8 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The combined businesses earned a record $111.7 million, or $2.42 per share, in 2010. Earnings for 2009 were $81.3 million or $2.36 per share. Non-GAAP earnings for 2009, excluding the impact of the SICO transaction, were $89.7 million or $1.97 per share. In the fourth quarter, the combined businesses earned $32.2 million or $0.69 per share in 2010 compared with $22.7 million or $0.50 per share in 2009.
"Both businesses remain focused on reducing costs, improving operational efficiencies and growing their business," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, observed.
"Our excellent overall performance took place in spite of continued weakness in the U.S. housing and commercial construction markets and the disruptions caused by the May flood in our largest water heater facility. This ongoing concentration on the fundamentals has had a strong impact on our overall performance and led us to report record earnings in four of the last five years," Jones noted.
Water Products Company (continuing operations)
Water Products sales increased by more than eight percent to $1.49 billion in 2010 compared with $1.38 billion in 2009, driven by a 30 percent increase in China water heater sales and a full year of sales from A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd., a business acquired in late 2009.
 
Operating profit declined approximately 11 percent to $132.9 million from $148.9 million in 2009 as the $35.4 million pre-tax charge for the May flood more than offset the increase in profits from higher China water heater sales. Operating margin, without the flood charge, increased to 11.3 percent from 10.8 percent in 2009.
In the fourth quarter, Water Products sales of $370.2 million were approximately two percent higher than 2009 fourth quarter sales of $362.3 million. A 14.9 percent increase in China water heater sales, the impact of pricing actions related to raw material costs, and higher U.S. commercial volumes were partially offset by lower U.S. residential water heater volumes.
Fourth quarter operating profit was $43.6 million, a 2.0 percent decline from the $44.5 million operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower U.S. residential water heater volumes and higher raw material costs. Operating margin in the fourth quarter, without the additional flood costs of $1.2 million pre-tax, was 12.1 percent compared with 12.3 percent in 2009.
Also in the fourth quarter, the company purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd. and now owns 100 percent of the water purification company. During the fourth quarter, the company incurred an impairment charge related to A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd.'s trademarks of $3.4 million and a restructuring charge related to moving the manufacturing plant of $1.8 million. The charges were largely offset by a $5.1 million gain on settlement of disputes with the prior owner of the company.
Electrical Products Company (discontinued operations)
On Dec. 13, the company announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell the Electrical Products segment to Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) for $875 million. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2011, following regulatory approvals. As a result of the announced sale, Electrical Products' results are shown as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Sales in 2010 for Electrical Products increased almost 14 percent to $705.8 million from sales of $620.4 million in 2009 driven by higher volumes in all of the division's strategic business units.
Operating earnings for Electrical Products more than doubled in 2010 to $74.1 million compared with the $32.5 million earned in the prior year. Higher volumes, lower operating costs, and improvements in plant efficiency were the major contributors to the
 
improved profitability. Additionally, operating profit in 2010 includes $3.2 million in expenses related to the sale of the business, and operating profit in 2009 included a net LIFO benefit of $10.1 million. Operating margins of 10.5 percent were significantly improved from 5.2 percent in 2009.
In the fourth quarter, Electrical Products reported sales of $166.4 million approximately 12 percent higher than fourth quarter 2009 sales of $148.4 million. All strategic business units experienced higher sales compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2010 significantly improved to $12.2 million compared with $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher volumes, lower operating costs, and improvements in plant efficiency were partially offset by $3.2 million in expenses related to the sale of the business. The 2009 operating profit in the fourth quarter included a net LIFO benefit of $6.8 million. Fourth quarter operating margins improved to 7.3 percent in 2010 from 3.4 percent in 2009.
Outlook for 2011
"A. O. Smith Corporation is poised for growth going into 2011," Jones commented. "We expect to benefit from continued double digit growth in our businesses in Asia. We also expect to benefit from the new high-efficiency water heating products introduced last year along with new product introductions in North America and China scheduled for 2011. We believe the U.S. economy will continue on the road to recovery, although we do not anticipate a sizable increase in the U.S. new housing or commercial construction markets this year."
"Consequently, we forecast earnings from continuing operations, excluding the impact from future acquisitions, of between $1.90 and $2.10 per share for this year," Jones stated.
Repositioning and Acquisition Strategy
"Today we are the leading water heating company in North America and China," Jones commented. "In the future, we aspire to not only be the leading water heater company in the world, but also to be a significant player in water treatment technology in developing and emerging markets."
"We plan to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and the proceeds from the sale of Electrical Products Company to focus on a number of strategic initiatives. We will look to grow our core residential and commercial water heating and water treatment businesses into fast-growing geographic markets. We will continue to pursue acquisitions in markets such as South America, Asia, and Africa.
 
"We also intend to expand our core product line by looking at acquisitions, joint ventures, or other business relationships that will allow us to expand our product offerings of boilers, heat pumps, and other high efficiency products. Finally, we will pursue opportunities in new and unique technologies that will be attractive to our customers and channel partners and will leverage our core competencies to create value for our shareholders."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
Smith Investment transaction impact to reported results
The 2009 full-year results reflect the impact of the required GAAP accounting related to the company's previously announced transaction with Smith Investment Company (SICO), which closed April 22, 2009. The company believes that providing non-GAAP earnings information is beneficial to investors in understanding the historical operations of the company. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share calculations is shown as part of the financial statements that accompany this release. The company will provide non-GAAP financial information for historical comparison purposes through the end of 2010. The following table contains both the GAAP and the non-GAAP information:
 
This release contains statements that the company believes are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "guidance" or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of
 
the date of this release. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations include, among other things, the following: the failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals from the government or regulatory agencies (including the terms of such approvals) pertaining to the sale of Electrical Products Company; and the risk that a condition to closing of the sale may not be satisfied; the ability to execute our acquisition strategy; significant volatility in raw material prices; competitive pressures on the company's businesses; inability to implement pricing actions; negative impact of future pension contributions on the company's ability to generate cash flow; instability in the company's electric motor and water products markets; further weakening in housing construction; further weakening in commercial construction; timing of any recoveries in housing or commercial construction; a slowdown in the Chinese economy; adverse general economic conditions and capital market deterioration; the impact of acquisition accounting or non-GAAP financial measures on the company's financial statements; difficulties in integrating the A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd. acquisition or the North American tankless water heater venture; difficulties in realizing future growth and profit expectations for the A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd. acquisition or the North American tankless venture and potential negative impacts on the company that the flooding of its Ashland City, Tenn., water heater manufacturing plant may have. Forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date of this release, and the company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributed to the company, or persons acting on its behalf, are qualified entirely by these cautionary statements.

Exhibit 99.1
April 19, 2011
A. O. Smith announces 14 percent increase in first quarter earnings
Milwaukee, Wis.A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $24.2 million or $.52 per share, an increase of $2.9 million above last year's first quarter.
Sales for the manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters increased $50.7 million to $417.4 million in the quarter ended March 31 compared with $366.7 million for the same period last year. Sales gains were led by a 51 percent increase in China, as a result of continued geographic expansion and an increased number of retail and specialty stores selling the premium A. O. Smith brand. Additionally, sales in the U.S. increased as a result of new energy efficient products launched last year. Finally, sales in both China and the U.S. increased during the quarter due to customer demand in advance of an announced April 1 price increase primarily related to higher steel costs.
Earnings from continuing operations increased approximately 14 percent to $24.2 million or $.52 per share compared with 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $21.3 million or $.46 per share, primarily due to higher sales. First quarter 2011 operating margins of 11.7 percent were down slightly from the 12.0 percent operating margins achieved last year principally due to higher selling costs supporting the North American Takagi tankless water heater acquisition and the company's renewable product introductions.
The company made a $45 million pension contribution during the first quarter and expects to contribute an additional $130 million to its pension plan later this year. Primarily as a result of the pension contribution, the company's debt-to-capital ratio increased to approximately 27 percent from 23 percent at the end of 2010.
 
Discontinued Operations
Sales of the discontinued Electrical Products Company in the first quarter increased approximately 28 percent to $201.5 million, $43.7 million higher than in the same period last year. The higher sales contributed to after-tax earnings from discontinued operations of $16.8 million or $.36 per share compared with $9.5 million or $.21 per share achieved last year; and operating margins improved to 11.6 percent from 9.1 percent last year.
Outlook for 2011
"The first quarter supports our view of how 2011 will unfold," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, observed. "We are continuing to benefit from market growth and consumer demand in China. In North America, our new high-efficiency water heating products introduced last year will continue to benefit sales. While the U. S. economy is recovering, we are mindful of the twin headwinds' of the weak new housing market and rising commodity prices. We responded to the rise in steel costs with a global price increase effective in April. At this time, we are not changing our forecast of earnings from continuing operations of between $1.90 and $2.10 per share for this year, excluding the potential impact from any future acquisitions," Jones said.
Acquisition Strategy
"A. O. Smith is one of the leading water heater companies in the world," Jones continued. "We plan to take advantage of our leadership in water heating and our developing expertise in water treatment technology and use the expected proceeds from the sale of Electrical Products Company to focus on a number of water-related strategic initiatives. We will look to grow our core residential and commercial water heating and water treatment businesses into fast-growing geographic markets. We will continue to pursue acquisitions in China and India where we have strong and growing platforms as well as new markets such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America.
"We also intend to expand our core product line by looking at acquisitions, joint ventures, or other business relationships that will allow us to expand our product offerings of boilers, heat pumps, and other high efficiency products," Jones explained. "Finally, we will pursue opportunities in water themed technologies that will be attractive to our customers and channel partners and leverage our core competencies to create value for our shareholders."
Electrical Products Company transaction
A. O. Smith Corporation entered into the definitive agreement to sell Electrical Products to Regal Beloit Corporation for $875 million on Dec. 12, 2010. On Feb. 4, the companies each received a request for additional information and documentary material
 
from the U. S. Department of Justice regarding the sale. The companies are working cooperatively with the Department of Justice as it reviews the proposed transaction. Subject to regulatory approval, the two companies expect a mid-year closing.
As part of the definitive agreement, A. O. Smith is to receive 2.83 million shares of Regal Beloit stock at closing. The shares have appreciated since the definitive agreement was signed. During the first quarter, the company purchased equity contracts for 50 percent of the expected shares to protect a portion of the appreciation. At the end of the quarter, the contracts were marked to market as required under accounting rules, resulting in a $1.6 million charge, which is included in other expense.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 19, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
July 19, 2011
A. O. Smith earns $28.6 million or $.62 per share in second quarter, including one - time items, on eight percent increase in sales
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today reported second quarter earnings from continuing operations of $28.6 million or $.62 per share on sales of $405.3 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Second quarter results included two one-time items: a pre-tax gain of $11.2 million associated with a legal settlement with a supplier and a pre-tax increase to the company's warranty reserve of $8.2 million related to a similar component concern in Canada. In addition, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.3 million related to the mark to market of an equity collar associated with the sale of Electrical Products Company, which more than offset a $1.6 million loss in the first quarter. The net favorable impact of these items was $.11 per share in the second quarter and $.08 per share for the first six months of 2011.
Continuing operations' results in the second quarter 2010 were a loss of $0.9 million or $.02 per share due to one-time pre-tax costs of $34.2 million or $.45 per share associated with the May 2010 flood at the company's Ashland City, Tenn., facility. Sales in the second quarter last year were $375.0 million.
For the first six months of 2011, A. O. Smith's continuing operations earned $52.8 million or $1.13 per share, which included the net favorable impact from the items identified above of $.08 per share, on sales of $822.7 million. For the same period in 2010, continuing operations earned $20.4 million or $.44 per share, which included the May 2010 flood costs, on sales of $741.7 million.
Cash used in operating activities during the first six months of 2011 was $104.8 million as a result of a $175 million pension contribution. The company expects cash provided by operating activities for the full year to be between $40 and $50 million.
Water Products Company
Sales for the three-month period ended June 30 were $405.3 million, an increase of approximately eight percent compared with sales of $375.0 million for the second quarter last year. An approximately 20 percent increase in water heater sales in China coupled with higher sales of commercial water heating products in North America and pricing actions related to commodity input costs more than offset a decline in North American residential water heater volumes, as customers purchased in the first quarter of the year in advance of an April 1 price increase. Second quarter 2011 sales were also higher as a result of the Takagi North America acquisition, completed on July 1, 2010, which expanded the company's capabilities in the U. S. tankless market.
Water Products Company's second quarter operating profits of $49.3 million included the net $3.0 million positive impact of the gain related to the settlement with the component supplier offset in part by the increase in the warranty reserve. The segment reported operating profits of $7.8 million in the same period last year, which included $34.2 million in costs related to the May 2010 flood. Operating margins of 12.2 percent in 2011 were higher than last year's flood-adjusted margins as a result of the one-time net positive impact noted above.
Discontinued Operations
Sales of the discontinued Electrical Products Company in the second quarter were approximately $221.9 million compared with sales of $197.6 million in the same period last year. After-tax earnings from discontinued operations in the second quarter were $21.7 million or $.46 per share and were Electrical Products' best second quarter performance in its history. Last year, the operations earned $17.5 million or $.38 per share in the second quarter.
Outlook for 2011
"Our China water heater business continues to grow, as sales were approximately 30 percent higher in the first half of this year," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, observed. "However, sales of higher-efficiency products in North America are not as strong as we expected without the tax incentives which were reduced at the beginning of this year. Sales of our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products sold at our retail outlets in China are right on track, but sales of water treatment products sold through our wholesale channel are lagging. As a result, we expect sales of water treatment products in China, as well as sales of higher efficiency products in North America, for the full year to be lower than our original plan."
"With the second half of the year remaining, we narrowed our forecast for earnings from continuing operations to between $1.95 and $2.05 per share for this year, excluding the potential impact from any future acquisitions, the settlement and addition to the warranty reserve and the quarterly mark to market of the equity collar."

Item 1.01.     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On July 18, 2011, A. O. Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("A. O. Smith") entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which A. O. Smith agreed to acquire Lochinvar Corporation of Lebanon, Tennessee ("Lochinvar"). Lochinvar is a leading manufacturer of high-efficiency boilers used in commercial and residential hydronic heating and hot water applications. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and related agreements, A. O. Smith agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding stock of Lochinvar and its U.K. sales affiliate, Lochinvar Limited, and Lochinvar's headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Lebanon, Tennessee. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions is equal to $418 million in cash an earnout of up to an additional $35 million in cash if certain revenue goals are met by November 2010. The purchase price in the Purchase Agreement is subject to a customary working capital adjustment. A. O. Smith will not assume Lochinvar's existing debt, which will be paid in connection with the consummation of the transaction. A. O. Smith expects to fund the purchase price with a combination of cash and debt, which it expects to borrow under its $425 million revolving credit facility. Neither transaction is subject to a financing condition.
plus
The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants of A. O. Smith and Lochinvar's shareholders. The consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others (i) clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (ii) the closing of the purchase of Lochinvar's headquarters and manufacturing facility, (iii) the absence of a material adverse change to Lochinvar, (iv) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by A. O. Smith and Lochinvar's shareholders, respectively, and (v) compliance by A. O. Smith and Lochinvar's shareholders with their respective obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for A. O. Smith and Lochinvar's shareholders if any of the conditions for closing have not been satisfied. Any party may seek specific performance of the Purchase Agreement if any other party breaches its obligations. The Purchase Agreement also provides for customary indemnification rights with respect to a breach of a representation and warranty or covenant by any party.
This description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms. Inclusion of this agreement is not intended to provide any other factual, business or operational information about A. O. Smith or Lochinvar. The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties made to and solely for the benefit of each other. The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties exchanged in connection with signing the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, investors and stockholders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in A. O. Smith's public disclosures.
Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this report that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on A. O. Smith's current expectations regarding the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Actual results and events in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. There can be no assurances that a transaction will be consummated. Other risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize as expected; that the transactions may not be timely completed, if at all; that, prior to the consummation of the transactions, if at all, one or more closing conditions may not be fulfilled; that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated; and other risks that are described in A. O. Smith's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in its subsequently filed SEC reports. A. O. Smith undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except to the extent otherwise required by law.

On August 22, 2011, A. O. Smith Corporation (the "Company") consummated the sale of its electric motor business (the "Business") to Regal Beloit Corporation ("RBC") pursuant to the terms of an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 12, 2010 (the "Purchase Agreement"), between the Company and RBC. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred to RBC certain assets and liabilities relating to the Business in the United States and all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of certain of the Company's active non-U.S. subsidiaries engaged in the Business. The sale of the portion of the Business in China was closed into escrow pending receipt of administrative approvals, which are expected shortly. The Company received at closing $700 million in cash, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment, and 2,834,026 shares of RBC common stock.
The shares of RBC common stock that the Company received are not currently freely saleable under U.S. securities laws. On August 22, 2011, the Company and RBC entered into a Shareholder Agreement (the "Shareholder Agreement"), which, among other things, provides that RBC will register such shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission so that such shares will be freely saleable. As previously disclosed in the Company's periodic filings, in the first quarter of 2011 the Company purchased an equity collar contract for 50% of its shares of RBC common stock that expires in March 2012.
The descriptions of the Purchase Agreement and the Shareholder Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement and the Shareholder Agreement, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties to the Purchase Agreement made to and solely for the benefit of each other. The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties exchanged in connection with signing the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, investors and stockholders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures.
A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Pro Forma Financial Information
Pro forma financial information reflecting the sale of the Business is not required because the Company reported the results of operations from, and assets and liabilities related to, the Business as discontinued operations in the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011.

On August 26, 2011, A. O. Smith Corporation ("A. O. Smith" or the "Company") consummated the acquisition of Lochinvar Corporation of Lebanon, Tennessee ("Lochinvar"). Lochinvar is a leading manufacturer of high-efficiency boilers used in commercial and residential hydronic heating and hot water applications. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2011 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among A. O. Smith, the shareholders of Lochinvar and Lochinvar Limited, and William L. Vallett, Jr., as Sellers' Representative, A. O. Smith purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Lochinvar and its U.K. sales affiliate, Lochinvar Limited, from the shareholders of such entities and, under a related agreement, A. O. Smith purchased Lochinvar's headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Lebanon, Tennessee from a related party of such shareholders, Knight Leasing Company, LLC. A. O. Smith paid an aggregate purchase price of $418 million in cash at closing for these transactions, consisting of $390 million for the stock of Lochinvar and Lochinvar Limited and $28 million for Lochinvar's headquarters and manufacturing facility. Under the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price is subject to a customary post-closing working capital adjustment, and A. O. Smith is also obligated to make an earnout payment of up to an additional $35 million in cash if certain revenue goals are met between December 1, 2011 and November 30, 2012.
The description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 is incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties to the Purchase Agreement made to and solely for the benefit of each other. The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties exchanged in connection with signing the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, investors and stockholders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures.

Exhibit 99.1
    August 26, 2011
A. O. Smith completes acquisition of Lochinvar Corporation
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced the completion of its acquisition of Lochinvar Corporation. The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $418 million which was funded from A. O. Smith's cash and revolving credit facility.
Milwaukee, Wis.
A. O. Smith received notification earlier today from the Federal Trade Commission that it had terminated the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period pertaining to the transaction.
Privately held Lochinvar is a leading manufacturer of high-efficiency boilers used in commercial and residential hydronic heating and hot water applications. A. O. Smith expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in the amount of approximately $.10 in the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding one-time purchase accounting charges and professional fees related to the acquisition, and in the range of $.40 to $.50 per share in 2012.
"The addition of Lochinvar represents an excellent fit with our strategy to become a leading global water technology company," Paul Jones, chairman and chief executive officer of A. O. Smith Corporation, said in announcing the completion of the sale transaction.
"Lochinvar is a well-known and widely respected brand in our industry, and their emphasis on energy efficient products, world-class quality, and outstanding customer service fit well with our existing water heater business."
"We're excited about the opportunity to grow the Lochinvar business, both domestically and outside of the U. S.," he continued.
Forward-looking statements
This release contains statements that the company believes are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 21, 2011, A. O. Smith Corporation ("the Company") issued a news release announcing the Company's third quarter earnings. A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following exhibit is being filed herewith:
(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated October 21, 2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated October 21, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
October 21, 2011
A. O. Smith reports higher earnings from continuing operations and also records net favorable impact from non-operating items
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $26.9 million or $.58 per share on sales of $412.0 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The third quarter 2011 results included pre-tax professional fees and expenses totaling $4.4 million related to the acquisition of Lochinvar. In addition, the company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $16.4 million related to shares of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) hedged with an equity collar. The favorable impact to earnings from the hedged RBC shares of $.21 per share less the Lochinvar related items of $.02 per share resulted in a net favorable impact to earnings of $.19 per share in third quarter 2011. Last year, earnings from continuing operations were $16.2 million or $.35 per share.
Water Products Company
Sales at the Water Products Company for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 were $412.0 million compared with sales of $377.4 million for the same period in 2010. Third quarter 2011 results include sales of $20.8 million from the Lochinvar business acquired on Aug. 26 and an increase in China water heater sales of 17 percent. Additionally, higher sales in India and of gas instantaneous water heaters in North America as well as global pricing actions related to higher steel costs helped to offset volume declines of residential and commercial water heaters in the U. S.
"We believe many of our customers took a very conservative approach to replenishing inventories during the quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones observed. "Fears of a double-dip recession throughout the summer along with the ongoing softness in the new housing and commercial construction markets had an adverse effect on our U.S. water heater business."
Third quarter operating profit of $39.9 million was six percent higher than the $37.6 million recorded last year. The company's recently acquired Lochinvar boiler operations contributed $3.0 million to 2011 third quarter operating profit. Contributions from higher sales in Asia and of gas instantaneous water heaters in North America were more than offset by lower residential and commercial water heater volumes in the U.S. As a result, operating margin declined to 9.7 percent from 10.0 percent last year.
Discontinued Operations
The company closed the sale of its Electrical Products business on Aug. 19 and received approximately $730 million in cash, including working capital adjustments, and 2.83 million Regal Beloit Corporation shares. Earnings from discontinued operations during the third quarter were $155.4 million or $3.33 per share, which included an after-tax gain on the sale of the business of $150.3 million, or $3.22 per share.
Cash Flow, Acquisitions and Share Buyback Authorization
Cash used in continuing operating activities during the first nine months of 2011 was $67.9 million including the impact from $175 million of pension contributions. Cash provided by operating activities and a tax benefit associated with the pension contributions are expected to generate cash flow from operations of between $10 and $15 million for the full year.
"We continue to pursue water heating and water treating investments all over the world, and we are committed to investments that increase shareholder value. Evaluating a stock buyback is part of our overall investment strategy," Jones indicated. "We have substantial amounts of cash from the sale of Electrical Products Company and debt capacity to make investments as well as buy back our shares."
Due to recent stock price declines, the company may begin to repurchase its shares. Currently, 1,363,800 shares remain on the 1.5 million share repurchase authorization, which was previously approved by its Board of Directors.
Outlook for 2011
"The integration of Lochinvar is progressing very well. We are pleased with the strong Lochinvar team and best-in-class operations. We expect earnings accretion in 2011 from Lochinvar to be approximately $.04 per share, which includes approximately $.14 per share in earnings from operations partially offset by approximately $.10 in non-recurring purchase accounting charges and professional fees related to the acquisition," Jones commented.
"We expect U. S. volumes will recover and a pre-buy of commercial water heaters by our Southern California customers will occur in the fourth quarter as a result of an air quality regulatory standard scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2012," Jones added.
"We have increased our full year 2011 guidance and now expect earnings to be between $2.00 and $2.10 per share, which incorporates a net benefit from Lochinvar of $.04 per share. This range excludes the potential impact from any future acquisitions, the settlement and addition to the warranty reserve announced earlier this year, and the impact of the hedged RBC shares."
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: November 14, 2011
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K/A Dated August 26, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
The Board of Directors of
Lochinvar Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Lochinvar Corporation as of November 28, 2010, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lochinvar Corporation as of November 28, 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
/s/ Lattimore Black Morgan & Cain, P.C.
Brentwood, Tennessee
February 10, 2011
(except for Note 18, as to which the date is November 10, 2011)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lochinvar Corporation (the "Company") is engaged in the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of commercial and residential water heaters and boilers to various customers located throughout the United States and other international markets.
 
 
Cash equivalents consist of short-term deposits and highly liquid marketable securities stated at cost which approximates market value.
 
Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms generally requiring payment within 30 days from invoice date. Certain customers have been granted extended payment terms and/or discounts based on certain criteria. Late or interest charges on delinquent accounts are not recorded until collected. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which reflects management's best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The allowance is estimated based on management's knowledge of its customers, historical loss experience and existing economic conditions. Accounts receivable and the allowance are written-off when, in management's opinion, all collection efforts have been exhausted.
 
Inventories consist principally of parts, raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using principally the straight-line method. Buildings and improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated lives or the respective lease term. Computer equipment is depreciated over three years. Furniture, fixtures and all other equipment and tooling are depreciated over four to ten years.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for renewals or betterments are capitalized. When property is retired or sold, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations.
 
 
Management evaluates the recoverability of the investment in long-lived assets on an ongoing basis and recognizes any impairment in the year of determination. It is reasonably possible that relevant conditions could change in the near term and necessitate a change in management's estimate of the recoverability of these assets.
 
The portfolio of marketable securities is stated at market value at the balance sheet dates and consists primarily of publicly-traded common stocks. Investment income is accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are reflected in earnings. Market values are determined based on quoted prices.
Marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value with the unrealized gain or loss reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
 
The Company purchases certain raw materials from overseas vendors and thus is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates among various currencies. The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in the accompanying statements of operations based upon the difference between the prevailing exchange rate at the time the related liabilities are incurred and when they are settled. The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $1,270,000 during 2010. These amounts are included in costs of sales in the accompanying statements of operations.
 
The Company has elected to be taxed as a Subchapter "S" corporation for federal income tax purposes. As such, all federal taxable income and losses pass through to the individual stockholders for inclusion in their personal income tax returns. The amount provided for state income taxes is based upon the current and deferred state taxes payable or refundable at the date of the financial statements as a result of all events recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of enacted state tax laws.
A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.
As of November 28, 2010, the Company has accrued no interest and no penalties related to uncertain tax positions. It is the Company's policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
 
 
The Company's products generally carry one to ten-year warranties from defects in workmanship and materials. The estimated cost of warranty obligations on units manufactured and sold by the Company is recognized in the period of the sale. Substantially all purchased units are supplied by one manufacturer and warranty obligations on these units are recognized in the period of sale only for that portion of the obligation not assumed by the supplier. Because of inherent uncertainties in estimating product warranties, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the recorded liability will occur within the near term.
 
Revenue is recognized by the Company upon shipment, as product ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $1,450,000 in 2010.
 
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
 
The Company offers certain sales incentives to its customers, in the form of rebates, whereby customers receive a periodic payment from the Company based on cumulative aggregate purchases over a specified period of time. The amount of these rebates is determined by management and recorded as a reduction of net sales on the accrual basis. Accordingly, net sales have been reduced for rebates in the approximate amount of $3,345,000 in 2010.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year that ends on a Sunday, typically the last Sunday in November. Fiscal year 2010 included 52 weeks.
 
For the originally issued financial statements, the Company evaluated events and transactions that occurred between November 28, 2010 and February 10, 2011, the date which the originally issued financial statements were issued. For the reissued financial statements, the Company evaluated subsequent events, summarized in Note 18, through November 10, 2011, the date the reissued financial statements were issued.
 
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard relating to variable interest entities. This standard amends previous standards and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise's variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, specifies updated criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity, and includes other provisions. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
 
Trade accounts receivable are due primarily from customers of the Company's commercial and residential water heaters and boilers.
The Company generally maintains cash and cash equivalents on deposit at banks in excess of federally insured amounts. Accordingly, at various times during the year, balances were uninsured and uncollateralized. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and, in management's opinion, cash and cash equivalents are not exposed to any significant credit risk.
Investment securities, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the balance sheet.
The Company utilized two suppliers for approximately 41% of inventory purchases during 2010.
 
 
Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity including quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), or significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (Level 3). The marketable securities are classified as Level 1 financial assets since the fair value inputs are established from quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. The cash surrender value of life insurance is classified as Level 3 financial assets since the fair value is based on information received from the insurance carriers indicating the financial performance of the policies and the amount the Company would receive should the policies be surrendered.
Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income tax deposit, accounts payable and certain other liabilities approximate their fair value due to their relatively short maturities.
Non-Financial Assets
The Company's non-financial assets, which include property and equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur, or if an annual impairment test is required and the Company is required to evaluate the non-financial instrument for impairment, a resulting asset impairment would require that the non-financial asset be recorded at the fair value. During the year ended November 28, 2010, the Company did not measure any non-financial assets at fair value or recognize any amounts in earnings related to changes in fair value for non-financial assets.
 
 
The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets at fair value as of November 28, 2010:
 
 
 
The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Plan's Level 3 assets for the year ended November 28, 2010:
 
 
A summary of inventories as of November 28, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
A summary of the portfolio of marketable securities as of November 28, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
 
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities at November 28, 2010, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
 
For the year ended November 28, 2010, proceeds from the sale of securities classified as available for sale totaled approximately $3,948,729.
At November 28, 2010, gross unrealized gains and losses pertaining to the marketable securities in the portfolio were as follows:
 
Gross realized gains and losses pertaining to the marketable securities in the portfolio that were included in the determination of earnings were as follows:
 
 
A summary of property and equipment as of November 28, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
 
The Company has an unsecured, short-term borrowing arrangement with a bank which provides for a $2,000,000 line of credit expiring in May 2011. Interest is charged at the bank's prime rate less 1.25% with a floor of 2.50%. There were no borrowings outstanding at November 28, 2010.
 
The Company sponsors a defined contribution profit sharing plan with a 401(k) feature. The plan covers all employees with one or more years of service. The plan allows pre-tax employee contributions. Participants can contribute up to 15% of their pre-tax compensation and receive, at the Company's discretion, up to 50% matching contribution on up to 6% of this contribution. The Company may make additional contributions to this plan. The amount, if any, is determined by the Company each plan year and an employee must be a participant on the last day of the plan year in order to participate in any such contribution. The Company's profit sharing plan contributions amounted to approximately $1,275,000 for 2010.
 
The Company self-insures its exposure to workers compensation claims and general business liability up to $150,000 and $250,000 for individual claim basis, respectively, and up to a combined basis of $2,780,000 on an aggregate claim basis, with insurance coverage obtained for exposure in excess of those amounts. It is possible that incurred but not reported claims may result in losses in excess of the amount accrued. However, in the opinion of management, any such claims would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position. In connection with the self-insurance, the Company maintains a letter of credit in the amount of $2,780,000 with a maturity of August 2011. The Company's accrued workers compensation liability at November 28, 2010 amounted to approximately $750,000. The Company's accrued general insurance liability at November 28, 2010 amounted to approximately $1,200,000.
 
Since the Company has elected to be taxed as a Subchapter "S" corporation for federal income tax purposes, no provision for federal income taxes has been made. The provision for state income taxes during 2010 is as follows:
 
 
 
Net deferred income taxes reflected in the balance sheet as of November 28, 2010 include the following amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities:
 
As of November 28, 2010, the Company has accrued no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Under this method, the total consideration transferred to consummate the Acquisition is being allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the closing date of the Acquisition. The principles of acquisition method of accounting require extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the consideration transferred to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Accordingly the allocation of the consideration transferred in the Pro Forma Financial Statements is preliminary and will be adjusted upon completion of the final valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such adjustments could be significant. The final valuation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after the closing date of the Acquisition. The Pro Forma Financial Statements do not include the costs that the Company may incur to integrate Lochinvar and these costs may be material.

(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated January 27, 2012.

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K Dated January 27, 2012
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
January 27, 2012
A. O. Smith continuing operations achieve record sales and earnings for 2011 driven by acquisitions and organic growth
.A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE-AOS) today announced sales of $1.71 billion and earnings of $111.2 million, or $2.39 per share, from continuing operations for 2011.
Milwaukee, Wis
Sales for 2011 grew 15 percent from $1.49 billion recorded in 2010. The recently acquired Lochinvar business added $75.9 million to sales, and sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew 29 percent to approximately $370 million for the year. Higher commercial water heater volumes in North America also contributed to higher sales.
Earnings from continuing operations for 2011 of $111.2 million, or $2.39 per share, included an after-tax gain of $12.9 million, or $.28 per share, related to shares of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) hedged with an equity collar, a legal settlement with a component supplier and an increase to a warranty reserve associated with a similar component in Canada. The Lochinvar business contributed $.07 per share to full-year earnings, which included interest expense and $.10 per share from non-recurring professional fees related to the acquisition and purchase accounting charges. Earnings from continuing operations in 2010 were $57.1 million, or $1.24 per share, and included flood costs of $21.6 million or $.47 per share.
In the fourth quarter, the company earned $31.5 million or $.68 per share on sales of $475.8 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the same three-month period in 2010 were $20.5 million or $.44 per share on sales of $370.2 million.
"The A. O. Smith team did an excellent job of achieving this record performance in a less than ideal economy," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, observed. "Our acquisition of Lochinvar is achieving all that we expected, our growth in China continued at the high end of our expectations, and we are delighted with the acceptance of our products and growth in India. As a result, we were able to overcome global economic headwinds to achieve record earnings from continuing operations for the fifth time in the last six years. "
Operating Results
A number of factors contributed to the record-setting sales performance in addition to the incremental sales from Lochinvar. These included strong double digit sales growth in China, a full year of sales of the company's line of tankless water heaters in North America, volume increases in its US commercial water heaters primarily as a result of the anticipated air quality standard change in Southern California for 2012 and raw material related pricing actions. In addition, the company's water heater business in India more than doubled its sales over the prior year to nearly $19 million.
Operating profit increased to $196.5 million in 2011 compared with $132.9 million in 2010. Higher operating profit in 2011 was driven by organic volume growth in the company's China and US commercial businesses, as well as $13.2 million from Lochinvar. Operating profit from growth was partially offset by a decline in Canadian water heater volumes and losses at the company's water treatment business. Operating profit in 2011 included the net $3.0 million positive impact of the gain related to the settlement with the component supplier offset in part by the increase in the warranty reserve in Canada. Operating profit in 2010 included a one-time charge of $35.4 million associated with the May 2010 flood at the Ashland City, Tenn., facility. Operating margins of 11.5 percent in 2011 were higher than last year's operating margins of 8.9 percent, which included the impact from the flood.
Sales for the quarter were $475.8 million compared with $370.2 million in the fourth quarter 2010 and included $55.2 million from Lochinvar. Sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew over 30 percent from the previous year. Higher residential volumes and the pre-buy of commercial water heaters in the US also contributed to the sales increase.
Fourth quarter operating profit of $58.4 million included $10.2 million from Lochinvar and was $14.8 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Higher China and US water heater volumes and operating profit from Lochinvar were partially offset by higher steel costs and lower water heater volumes in Canada. Operating margin increased to 12.3 percent from the 11.8 percent operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Cash Flow and Share Buyback Authorization
The company generated $57.3 million in cash from continuing operating activities in 2011 which included the pre-tax impact from $175 million in pension contributions. Cash balances, largely held offshore, were $463.4 million, and outstanding debt was $461.6 million at the end of 2011. The company's leverage as measured by the ratio of debt to total capital increased to 30 percent at the end of 2011 compared with 23 percent at the end of last year as a result of borrowing to fund the purchase of Lochinvar.
During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $37.69 per share, representing a total of approximately $17.9 million. For the entire year, repurchases totaled 611,000 shares at an average price of $38.69 per share for a total of approximately $23.5 million. A total of approximately 890,000 shares remained in the existing repurchase authority at the end of 2011.
Outlook for 2012
"Although the U. S. economy is showing no signs of recovery, we continued to demonstrate that we can be successful in creating shareholder value without a benefit from new construction, and we believe A. O. Smith is well-positioned for future growth when new construction begins to recover," Jones said. "Our balance sheet and cash flow are strong and will support our active acquisition pipeline, our replacement water heater business in North America remains stable, and we are well established in China and India. The addition of Lochinvar and its potential to grow in both the domestic and international markets is another positive, which we expect will add $.40 to $.50 per share to our results in 2012."
"While we carefully watch for signs of an economic slowdown in China and are concerned about the ongoing weakness of domestic construction, we believe our China businesses will grow approximately twice as fast as China's GDP rate, and we expect no benefit from new construction in North America. We could see a decline in North American commercial volumes as a result of the pre-buy in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the Southern California air quality standard change, but we believe the balance of North American water heater volumes will be flat in 2012 because of the replacement business. We expect our Lochinvar business will grow in excess of 10 percent in 2012 compared with full year 2011, as the boiler industry continues to transition from lower efficiency to higher efficiency boilers. We expect improved operating performance from our India water heater and China water treatment businesses in 2012 compared with 2011. However, we estimate significantly higher pension expense in 2012 partially due to a lower discount rate and lower investment returns. All this considered, we estimate 2012 earnings will be in a range of $2.65 and $2.85 per share. This range does not include the potential impact from any future acquisitions or the impact of the RBC share activity."
 
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.

A. O. Smith first quarter sales and earnings increase
due to contributions from acquired business and growth in China
A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) today announced first quarter net earnings of $47.5 million or $1.02 per share on a 12 percent increase in revenue.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The net earnings were $23.3 million higher than the $24.2 million or $.52 per share earned from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 net earnings included an after-tax gain of $16.7 million, or $.36 per share related to the sale of shares of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE:RBC) which were received from the 2011 divestiture of the electric motor business.
First quarter sales were $468.6 million compared with sales of $417.4 million for the same period last year. The higher sales were the result of first quarter contributions from Lochinvar which was acquired in August 2011 and an 18 percent increase in sales of A. O. Smith branded product in China.
"Two highlights in the quarter came from our higher growth businesses," Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Lochinvar grew over 10 percent, and our sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China continued to grow at a double digit rate."
North America
Sales of the North America segment, which includes the U.S. and Canada water heater and boiler businesses, increased 10 percent to $353.3 million from first quarter 2011 sales of $321.7 million. Sales of $49.3 million from Lochinvar were partially offset by lower sales of U. S. residential and commercial water heaters compared with the first quarter last year due to the pre-buy in advance of an April 2011 price increase. Commercial gas water heater sales for Southern California were also lower following a pre-buy in the fourth quarter 2011 driven by a change in air quality standards in that region at the beginning of this year.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $42.2 million, an 11 percent increase over earnings of $38.1 million in last year's first quarter. The higher earnings were the result of contributions from Lochinvar, which were partially offset by the effect of lower U.S. water heater volumes and higher steel costs. First quarter operating margin was 11.9 percent, slightly improved from the 11.8 percent operating margin experienced last year.
Rest of World
This segment, which consists of the China, India, and Europe water heating businesses and the water treatment business in Asia, reported first quarter sales of $124.2 million, $19 million higher than first quarter 2011 sales of $105.2 million. Higher sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China, driven in part by a pre-buy ahead of an April 2012 price increase, were the primary reason for the sales increase.
Operating earnings of $14.2 million were 31 percent higher than the $10.8 million earned in the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to the higher volumes in China. First quarter operating margin of 11.4 percent improved from 2011 first quarter operating margin of 10.3 percent.
During the first quarter, the company broke ground for a new 457,000 square foot water heater plant in Nanjing, China. The new plant, which is scheduled to go into production during mid-2013, will accommodate increased water heater demand as well as growth for new products recently introduced in the China market such as heat pump, solar, and combi boiler.
Regal Beloit share activity and leverage
During the first quarter, the company sold all of the shares of Regal Beloit stock for $187.6 million or an average price of $66.19 per share. The majority of the proceeds was received before March 31 and used to pay down revolving credit debt during the first quarter. The proceeds received after March 31, or $64.7 million, were used to pay down revolving credit debt during the first week of April. The company had cash and marketable securities of $428.1 million and debt of $319.2 million at the end of March 2012.
 
Outlook for 2012
"Although the U. S. economy is showing some positive signs of recovery including some positive data in the new construction sector, we still have a long way to go to fully recover from the recession," Jones said. "As we've stated before, we expect little to no benefit from new construction this year as our water heater business tends to lag behind new construction by six to nine months. However, our North American replacement water heater business remains on solid ground. Sales at Lochinvar continue to grow as expected. We project growth in 2012 to be in excess of 10 percent over their historical performance, and we look forward to a full year's contributions from this newest member of our team."
"Based on what we have seen so far this year, we have increased our estimate for 2012 earnings to a range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share," Jones continued.

A copy of the Company's news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Current Report") and is incorporated by reference herein.

(99.1) News Release of A. O. Smith Corporation, dated July 18, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 18, 2012
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
A. O. Smith second quarter sales, earnings increase driven by Lochinvar acquisition and strong organic China growth
July 18, 2012A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS), a leading water technology company, today announced second quarter net earnings of $35.0 million or $.75 per share, compared with $28.6 million or $.62 per share from continuing operations in the prior year's second quarter on a 19 percent increase in revenue.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Second quarter 2011 earnings from continuing operations included several non-operating items resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $8.3 million, or $.11 per share. Excluding these items from 2011 results, second quarter 2012 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 47 percent over the same period last year.
Revenues for the quarter ending June 30 increased $78.9 million to $484.2 million. Growth was driven by contributions from Lochinvar, which was acquired in August 2011, double digit growth of A. O. Smith branded sales in China and higher U.S. residential and commercial volumes ahead of a previously announced price increase effective in June.
"Our business in China continued to grow at the pace we expected this year," commented Paul W. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our success is driven by a number of factors, many of which are unique to our consumer-oriented business in China. Our retail expansion in China is on track to add approximately 800 outlets in 2012 which will bring the total to 6,200 outlets by the end of this year. A second factor is our highly recognizable, premium brand, 15 years in the making, which continued to grow share. Finally, our relatively new gas tankless products have grown more rapidly than the overall China business," elaborated Jones.
North America
Sales of the North America segment, which includes the U. S. and Canada water heater and boiler businesses, increased $62.3 million to $365.9 million in the second quarter of 2012. Sales of Lochinvar contributed $52.7 million to revenues. In addition, higher volumes of U. S. residential and commercial water heaters in anticipation of a June price increase were partially offset by lower sales of tankless products in the U. S. and water heaters in Canada.
Operating earnings for the segment of $51.2 million were approximately $12.9 million higher than the 2011 second quarter, which included a net gain of $3.0 million related to a settlement with a component supplier offset in part by an increase to the warranty reserve. Lochinvar contributed $10.4 million to 2012 quarterly earnings, and higher volumes due to the pre-buy ahead of the June price increase also contributed to the improved earnings performance in the quarter. As a result of Lochinvar's performance and higher water heater volumes, second quarter operating margin of 14.0 percent improved significantly compared with the second quarter 2011 operating margin of 11.6 percent, which excludes the one-time net gain.
Rest of World
Second quarter sales of this segment, which includes the China, India, and Europe water heating businesses and the water treatment business in China, increased $16.7 million to $127.2 million, driven by a 17 percent increase in sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China. The company's business in China continued to benefit from the demographic trends of a growing middle class and the further urbanization of the China population.
Operating earnings of $12.3 million increased 12 percent over the prior year's second quarter due to earnings growth in China which was partially offset by larger losses than last year in India due to higher costs related to brand building and product introductions in the region and the weaker rupee. As a result, second quarter operating margin of 9.7 percent was slightly lower than last year's operating margin of 10.0 percent.
 
Share Repurchase, Leverage and Cash
Consistent with the company's stated strategy to buyback shares to offset the impact from equity awards used in its long-term incentive compensation programs as well as opportunistic purchases, A. O. Smith repurchased approximately 218,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $44.51 per share for a total cost of $9.7 million. A total of approximately 670,000 shares remain on the share repurchase authorization ratified by the company's Board of Directors in December 2010.
Long-term debt totaled $284.6 million at the end of June, resulting in leverage of 20 percent, measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. Cash and investments, located largely outside of the United States, totaled $439.7 million at the end of the 2012 second quarter.
In the second quarter, the company announced a 25 percent increase to its quarterly dividend on its Common stock and Class A Common stock. The increase results in a quarterly dividend of $.20 per share.
Outlook for 2012
"Thanks to our stable replacement water heater business in North America and our strong international performance, A. O. Smith continues to perform well in a less-than-ideal economy," Jones observed. "We expect Lochinvar's sales will grow over 10 percent this year, as customers continue to upgrade to Lochinvar's market-leading, high-efficiency condensing product lines."
"We anticipate the pre-buy we experienced in the second quarter will result in lower U.S. residential and commercial volumes in the third quarter, which historically is also our lightest quarter for U. S. water heater volumes. However, we continue to expect U.S. volumes this year will be similar to last year. Due to the historically seasonally strong second half of the year which we expect from Lochinvar's boilers for space heating, we will raise the bottom of our estimate of 2012 earnings to a range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share," Jones continued. "This range does not include the potential impact from any future acquisitions or the first quarter gain from the sale of our RBC shares. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will continue to employ the disciplined approach to identifying candidates that meet our strategic criteria and add value for our shareholders."

October 9, 2012
A. O. Smith announces Jones to become executive chairman,
Rajendra named chief executive officer
The A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) Board of Directors today announced Paul W. Jones will transition from chairman and chief executive officer to executive chairman of the corporation, effective Jan. 1, 2013, at which time, Ajita G. Rajendra will assume the role of president and chief executive officer.
Milwaukee, Wis.
In this newly created role, Jones will continue to lead the company's Board of Directors as the executive chairman and will remain actively involved in the company's strategy development, mergers and acquisitions, investor relations, and developing executive talent for the Milwaukee-based water technology company.
Rajendra, who is currently president and chief operating officer, will assume the role of chief executive and have responsibility for strategy development and implementation, profitability, and shareholder returns for the company which has nearly $2 billion in sales, 17 manufacturing operations, and more than 10,500 employees worldwide.
"With our water technology strategy well under way, now is an appropriate time to transition the chief executive responsibilities to Ajita, who was actively involved in the development of this strategy," Jones commented. "In addition, he is well known and respected throughout the industry and is an outstanding business person with strategic vision and excellent execution skills. He is passionate about taking care of customers and delivering outstanding returns to our shareholders. Under his leadership, I am confident A. O. Smith will continue to grow and become one of the leading water technology companies in the world."
"Paul Jones has had a significant impact on our company by spearheading the strategic action of becoming a focused, global water technology company," said Ronald D. Brown, lead director of the company. "He and his team have assembled an impressive list of accomplishments which have contributed to the company's total shareholder return of nearly 10 times that of the S&P 500 over the past five years," Brown pointed out.
 
"The board views this important leadership transition as well planned and well executed," Brown observed. "We're fortunate to have Paul in a position to concentrate on the critical areas of identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates as well as enhancing the bench strength' of our executive ranks to support our growth aspirations. And Ajita brings to the chief executive role more than 30 years of industry experience and a proven track record of accomplishment at A.O. Smith, more than doubling sales and increasing profitability by nearly five fold during his tenure with the company. The board is excited at the prospect of having these two talented executives working together to create additional value for our shareholders."
"This is an excellent opportunity for Paul and me to further strengthen our company," Rajendra observed. "Both of us feel positive about the long-term outlook for A. O. Smith. I am committed to continue the current strategy, grow the business, and provide meaningful returns to our shareholders."
Jones joined A. O. Smith in January 2004 as president and chief operating officer and was named to the company's Board of Directors in December of that year. He was named chairman and chief executive officer in December 2005.
In addition to the A. O. Smith board, he is a member of the Federal-Signal Corporation and the Integrys Energy Corporation Boards of Directors. Jones also is a member of the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), and serves on the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of MAPI.
Jones is also very active in the Milwaukee-area community serving on several non-profit boards, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Milwaukee and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. During 2012, he is serving as co-chair of the United Way of Greater Milwaukee community campaign.
Rajendra joined A. O. Smith in February 2005 as president of its Water Products Company, a manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers, and was named an executive vice president of the corporation in 2006. He was named president and chief operating officer in August 2011 and was elected to the company's Board of Directors in December of that year.

Exhibit 99.1
 
October 17, 2012
A. O. Smith reports higher sales and earnings from continuing operations
Water technology company A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) reported third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $37.0 million or $.79 per share on a 12.2 percent increase in revenue.
Milwaukee, Wis.
The company's 2012 third quarter performance included a full quarter of Lochinvar's results, which was acquired in late August last year, as well as a non-cash, pre-tax gain of $6.4 million or $.08 per share resulting from a change to the company's estimate of the Lochinvar earn-out, which is based on revenue targets.
Prior-year third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $26.9 million or $.58 per share included a net pre-tax gain of $16.4 million related to shares of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE:RBC) and an equity collar, as well as pre-tax professional fees and expenses totaling $4.4 million related to the purchase of Lochinvar. The net favorable impact to earnings from these items in last year's third quarter was $.19 per share.
Sales for the three-month period ended Sept. 30 were $462.2 million, more than $50 million higher than third quarter 2011 sales of $412.0 million, driven by incremental Lochinvar sales and strong organic growth in China.
"The factors that have been influencing our business throughout 2012 continued during the third quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul W. Jones commented. "Our A. O. Smith branded sales in China grew over 20 percent in the quarter driven by new distribution, market share gains and new products, despite the slowdown in that country's economy."
"The Lochinvar acquisition continues to meet the high end of our profit expectations," he observed. "Lochinvar's new line of CREST high-efficiency, higher BTU input condensing boilers, which was introduced last year, has received excellent market acceptance; and we plan to launch new, larger input models of this product later this year."
North America segment
Third quarter sales of the North America segment, which includes U. S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers, increased to $335.7 million compared with third quarter 2011 sales of $310.2 million. The company benefited from sales of $60.1 million of Lochinvar products, compared with last year's partial quarter contribution of $20.8 million. Additionally, higher commercial water heater volumes were more than offset by lower residential water heater and tankless volumes.
Operating earnings from the segment of $50.7 million included a gain of $6.4 million related to the adjustment to the company's estimate of the Lochinvar earn-out, compared with $30.9 million earned during the third quarter of 2011. Profits from the Lochinvar acquisition contributed $14.9 million to quarterly earnings compared with $3.0 million last year. In addition, the segment benefited from higher commercial volumes and material costs that were lower than their relatively high levels last year. These benefits more than offset the volume decline in residential water heaters. As a result, third quarter operating margin of 15.1 percent was higher than third quarter 2011 margin of 10.0 percent.
Under the terms of the Lochinvar purchase agreement, Lochinvar's shareholders could earn up to an additional $35 million if certain revenue objectives are achieved from Dec. 1, 2011, to Nov. 30, 2012. At the time of the closing, the company projected the earn-out to be $16.8 million due to an estimated 16 percent increase in sales. Based on the current estimate of a 12 percent increase in sales, the earn-out is projected to be $10.4 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $6.4 million that has been recorded in the third quarter.
 
Rest of World segment
Third quarter sales of this segment, which includes China, India, and Europe, increased more than $23 million to $133.8 million compared with sales of $110.5 million in the third quarter of 2011. Sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China increased approximately 22 percent in the quarter due to continued distribution expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, greater acceptance of gas tankless and water treatment systems, and continued market share gains.
Third quarter operating profit increased approximately 41 percent to $12.7 million compared with $9.0 million earned in the prior year's quarter. Increased sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China and reduced losses from the company's China water treatment business contributed to the improved third quarter earnings. Operating margin of 9.5 percent improved compared with the third quarter 2011 operating margin of 8.1 percent.
Leverage and Cash
Long-term debt totaled $279.6 million at the end of September 2012, resulting in leverage of 19.0 percent, measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. Cash and investments, located largely outside the United States, totaled $482.2 million at the end of the 2012 third quarter.
Outlook for 2012
"A. O. Smith continues to make progress as it pursues its strategy to become a global water technology company," Jones said. "The integration of the Lochinvar acquisition is essentially complete, and our pipeline of possible acquisition candidates remains active. We continue to pursue water heater and water treatment investments all over the world, and we are committed to investments that increase shareholder value. With more than $400 million in cash and an additional $400 million in borrowing capacity, we believe we have more than enough resources to take advantage of the right opportunities when they come along."
 
"Our businesses continue to perform well in a challenging global economy," he said. "Our focus on customers, combined with disciplined cost management, is paying off throughout the organization. We expect this strong performance to carry through to the end of the year. Consequently, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full year to between $2.85 and $2.95 per share. This does not include the potential impact from any future acquisitions, the first quarter gain from the sale of the RBC shares, or adjustments to the estimate of the calculation of the Lochinvar earn-out."

The Company may increase the maximum aggregate amount of availability under the revolving credit facility to up to $500 million if certain conditions are satisfied, including, without limitation, the absence of any event of default or default under the Credit Agreement and the Company obtaining the consent of the lenders participating in the increase.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, which will be adjusted based on the Company's Leverage Ratio (as defined below), or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin, which will be adjusted based on the Company's Leverage Ratio. The Company must also pay (1) a facility fee ranging from 0.150% to 0.30% per annum (based on the Company's Leverage Ratio) on the amount of each lender's commitment and (2) a participation fee ranging from 1.100% to 1.825% per annum (based on the Company's Leverage Ratio) of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and, with certain exceptions, its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, the Company may not permit, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, (1) the ratio of its consolidated funded debt to the sum of its consolidated funded debt plus its consolidated stockholders' equity (the "Leverage Ratio") to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and (2) the ratio of its consolidated net income (excluding extraordinary gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash charges and income ("EBITDA") for the four fiscal quarters then ended to its consolidated interest expense, including yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations (if any) for the same period to be less than 3.5 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement provides for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions during the period to which such calculation relates.
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. However, certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company will unconditionally guarantee the Company's obligations from time to time arising under the Credit Agreement, and the Company will unconditionally guarantee the obligations of the Canadian Borrower and the Dutch Borrower under the Credit Agreement to the extent that the Canadian Borrower and/or the Dutch Borrower borrow directly under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Company or any of its material subsidiaries becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (and such Deteriorating Lender) or that the total amount thereof is less than such Deteriorating Lender's Total Pro Rata Share of the then Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Deteriorating Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or deliver to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the excess of (x) such Deteriorating Lender's Total Pro Rata Share of the then Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations over (y) the total amount of Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right or claim. Upon the drawing of any Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Governmental Rules, to reimburse the L/C Issuer solely to the extent the Company otherwise fails to satisfy its obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer in respect of such drawing; such Cash Collateral will be released back to the Deteriorating Lender when and to the extent such Deteriorating Lender's obligations are reduced or eliminated, whether as a result of an assignment of such Deteriorating Lender's Commitment, or a reduction in or termination of such Letters of Credit, or such Lender ceases to be a Deteriorating Lender or otherwise.

2.21 . The Canadian Borrower or the Dutch Borrower may from time to time, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each Lender), (a) so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists, increase the amount of the Canadian Sublimit and/or the Dutch Sublimit, as applicable, by an amount equal to U.S.$5,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of U.S.$1,000,000, but not to exceed, together with any increases in the Canadian Sublimit and the Dutch Sublimit pursuant to , U.S.$25,000,000 in the aggregate with respect to each of the Canadian Sublimit and the Dutch Sublimit, or (b) terminate the Canadian Sublimit and/or the Dutch Sublimit, as applicable, or permanently reduce the Canadian Sublimit and/or the Dutch Sublimit, as applicable, to an amount that is not less than the Total Canadian Dollar Outstandings or the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Dutch Loans, respectively.

Taxes
(a) Any and all payments by any Borrower to any Lender and the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and any Note shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In addition, the Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes.
(b) If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, then:
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;
(ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;
 
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law; and
(iv) such Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of any applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent, at the time interest is paid, all additional amounts which such Lender or the Administrative Agent specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender or the Administrative Agent would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.
(c) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each applicable Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes in the amount that such Lender or the Administrative Agent specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender or the Administrative Agent would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date a Lender or the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Borrower will be obligated to indemnify any Lender or the Administrative Agent for any Other Taxes that are to be paid as a result of such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in failing to timely pay such amounts when due.
(d) Within 10 days after the date of any payment by a Borrower of Taxes or Other Taxes, such Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Lender and the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to such Lender and the Administrative Agent.
(e) If a Borrower is required to pay any amount to a Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to or of this Section, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions and such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's internal policies) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office or other relevant office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by such Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the sole judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent would not result in any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense or otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Administrative Agent.
subsection (b)
(c)
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this , it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Borrower agrees, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or Lender, to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any
Section 3.1

penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or Lender if the Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
subsection (f)
3.2 .
Illegality
(a) If any Lender determines that any Change of Law has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
(b) If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any Eurodollar Loan, the Company shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay, or cause the Dutch Borrower to prepay, in full such Eurodollar Loan, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under , either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof or, if earlier, on the date on which such Lender may no longer lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loan. If the Company is required to so prepay, or cause the Dutch Borrower to so prepay, any Eurodollar Loan, then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company or the Dutch Borrower, as applicable, shall borrow from the Affected Lender, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan. If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any CDOR Rate Loan, the Company shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay, or cause the Canadian Borrower to prepay, in full such CDOR Rate Loan, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under , either on the last day of the applicable quarter with respect thereof or, if earlier, on the date on which such Lender may no longer lawfully continue to maintain such CDOR Rate Loan.

(d) Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent or demand upon the Company under this Section, the Affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Rate Loans, as applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
3.3 .
Increased Costs and Reduction of Return
(a) If after the date hereof any Lender determines that, due to either (i) any Change of Law (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the calculation of interest pursuant to ) or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of Law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, within 30 days after demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay, or cause the Dutch Borrower to pay, to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs.

(c) the failure of such Borrower to make any prepayment of a Loan in accordance with any notice delivered under ;
Section 2.9

Inability to Determine Rates
(a) If the Administrative Agent determines that (i) for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan or (ii) Lenders having 35% or more of the amount of the Commitments notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and the Dutch Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company and the Dutch Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Company or the Dutch Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Company or the Dutch Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Company or the Dutch Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Loans.
subsection 2.12(a)
(b) If the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining CDOR the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Canadian Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain CDOR Rate Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Canadian Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing with respect to CDOR Rate Loans then submitted by it. If the Canadian Borrower does not revoke such Notice of Borrowing, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue CDOR Rate Loans, as proposed by the Canadian Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Canadian Borrower, and such CDOR Rate Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Canadian Prime Loans bearing interest at the rate specified in clause (ii) of the definition of Canadian Prime Rate.
 
3.6 . Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation under this shall deliver to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prior to or contemporaneously with any demand for payment under this , a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and a computation of the amount payable to, such Lender, and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, any Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution method. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no amount shall be payable by a Borrower pursuant to or with respect to any period commencing more than 90 days before the delivery of the certificate contemplated by this unless such amount is claimed as a result of the retroactive effect of any newly enacted or adopted law, rule or regulation and such certificate is delivered within 90 days after such enactment or adoption.

Upon receipt by any affected Lender of a written notice from the Administrative Agent stating that the Administrative Agent is exercising the replacement right set forth in this , such affected Lender shall sell and assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including for purposes of this , participations in L/C Obligations) to the replacement Lender pursuant to for a purchase price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the affected Lender's Loans so sold and assigned or such other amount as is agreed to by such affected Lender and such replacement Lender), all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and its ratable share of all fees to which it is entitled. If such affected Lender fails to execute the documentation required to effectuate such assignment, such documentation may be executed by any Borrower on behalf of such affected Lender.

Exhibit 99.1
 
January 24, 2013
A. O. Smith continuing operations achieve record sales and earnings for 2012 driven by acquisition and organic growth
Water technology company A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE-AOS) today announced record sales of $1.94 billion and earnings of $162.6 million, or $3.49 per share, from continuing operations for 2012.
Milwaukee, Wis.
Sales from continuing operations for 2012 grew 13 percent from $1.71 billion recorded in 2011. The Lochinvar business, acquired in August 2011, added $225.7 million to sales compared with $75.9 million in 2011, and sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew 20 percent to approximately $448 million for the year.
Earnings from continuing operations for 2012 of $162.6 million, or $3.49 per share, included an after-tax gain of $16.8 million, or $.36 per share, related to the sale of shares of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) which were received from the 2011 divestiture of the electric motor business. Earnings also included an after-tax gain of $2.9 million, or $.06 per share, related to a settlement with a component supplier in Canada and an after-tax gain of $2.0 million, or $.04 per share, resulting from revisions to the company's estimate of the Lochinvar earn-out. Earnings from continuing operations for 2011 of $111.2 million, or $2.39 per share, included an after-tax gain of $12.9 million, or $.28 per share, related to shares of RBC hedged with an equity collar, a legal settlement with a component supplier and an increase to a warranty reserve associated with the Canadian component supplier.
In the 2012 fourth quarter, the company earned $43.2 million or $.93 per share from continuing operations on sales of $524.3 million. 2012 earnings included an after-tax gain of $2.9 million, or $.06 per share, related to the settlement with the Canadian component supplier and an after-tax expense of $1.9 million, or $.04 per share, resulting from the final revision to the company's estimate of the Lochinvar earn-out due to higher than previously estimated sales. Earnings from continuing operations for the same three-month period in 2011 were $31.5 million or $.68 per share on sales of $475.8 million.
"With a strong fourth quarter and solid performance for the full year, the A. O. Smith team did an excellent job again in 2012 driving the company to achieve record sales and net earnings," Ajita G. Rajendra, president and chief executive officer, observed. "We are very pleased with Lochinvar's performance, and our China business' growth was more than two and one-half times that country's GDP growth last year. Although our North American new construction business continued to be affected by the slow economic recovery, we were able to take advantage of our strength in the replacement portion of the water heater and boiler markets."
North America segment
Full-year sales for the North America segment, which includes U. S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers, were $1.43 billion, an 11 percent increase over 2011 sales of $1.29 billion. The business segment benefited from a full year of sales from Lochinvar, as well as improved volumes for U. S. residential and commercial water heaters, which were partially offset by lower tankless and Canadian water heater volumes.
Operating profit of $199.8 million was $45.8 million higher than 2011 operating profit of $154.0 million. The unit benefited from full year earnings contributed by Lochinvar and higher U. S. residential and commercial water heater volumes. The 2012 segment operating profit included a pre-tax $3.9 million settlement with a component supplier and income of $3.3 million related to the adjustment to the company's estimate of the Lochinvar earn-out. The 2011 segment operating profit includes a net gain of $3.0 million related to the legal settlement with a component supplier and an increase to the warranty reserve associated with the Canadian component supplier. Operating margin of 14.0 percent, which included the benefit from the settlement and the Lochinvar earn-out adjustment, was higher than the 2011 margin of 11.9 percent.
Fourth quarter sales for the North American segment increased six percent over the prior year's fourth quarter to $375.9 million. The segment benefited from higher demand for U. S. residential water heaters, which was partially driven by "SuperStorm Sandy" on the East Coast. Higher sales of Lochinvar boilers also contributed to the increase in sales. Fourth quarter operating profit of $55.7 million increased 19 percent over the $46.7 million earned in the fourth quarter of the prior year primarily driven by higher U. S. residential water heater volumes and an increase in boiler sales. Operating margin of 14.8 percent expanded over the 2011 fourth quarter margin of 13.2 percent.
 
Rest of World segment
Sales of this segment, which includes China, India, and Europe, increased 19 percent in 2012 to $542.5 million. Sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew more than 20 percent to approximately $448 million primarily due to a higher priced product mix in the region as a result of product introductions with more robust features and benefits, as well as pricing actions. Market share gains and higher sales of water treatment products also drove China sales higher. Water heater sales in India increased to more than $20 million, despite a14 percent currency devaluation.
Operating profit for this segment increased 40 percent to $59.6 million compared with $42.7 million earned in 2011. The profit increase was driven by higher volumes of A. O. Smith branded products in China and reduced losses in the non- A. O. Smith branded water treatment business, which were partially offset by larger losses in India due to higher costs for new product introductions and brand building in the region. Operating margin improved to 11.0 percent compared with 2011 margin of 9.4 percent.
Sales for the fourth quarter of the Rest of World segment of $157.2 million were 21 percent higher than last year, driven by higher sales in China and India. Operating profit of $20.4 million was significantly higher than the $11.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter last year primarily due to higher sales in China. Operating margin for the period was 13.0 percent compared with 9.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Cash, Leverage, Share Buyback and Acquisitions
Long-term debt totaled $243.7 million at the end of December 2012, resulting in leverage of 17 percent as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. Cash and investments, located largely outside the United States, totaled $462.9 million at the end of the year. A $13.5 million earn-out was paid to the former owners of Lochinvar in December 2012.
During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 208,101 shares of common stock at an average price of $59.04 per share, representing a total of $12.3 million. For the entire year, repurchases totaled 426,490 shares at an average price of $51.60 per share for a total of $22.0 million. A total of approximately 462,000 shares remained in the existing repurchase authority at the end of 2012.
 
"Our pipeline of possible acquisition candidates remains active," Paul W. Jones, executive chairman, commented. "We continue to pursue water heating and water related investments all over the world, but we will remain selective and only make acquisitions that we believe will increase shareholder value. With more than $400 million in cash and a meaningful amount of incremental borrowing capacity, we are confident we have the resources available to take advantage of global opportunities that add long-term value."
Discontinued Operations
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded non-cash expense of $3.9 million on the gain on sale of its Electrical Products Company discontinued operations which occurred in the third quarter of 2011. The non-cash charge was comprised of a $6.4 million correction primarily due to its calculation of taxes due upon repatriation of undistributed earnings offset by a change in the estimate related to other reserves associated with discontinued operations of $2.5 million.
Introduction of new Non-GAAP measures for 2013
Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increase in certain components of pension expense that the company considers to be unrelated to its underlying operating performance. In addition, the company has made changes to its pension plan, including closing the plan to new entrants effective Jan. 1, 2010, and freezing the plan for the majority of existing participants effective Jan. 1, 2015, which it believes will significantly decrease pension expense beginning in 2015. In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of the company's business, beginning in 2013, the company will provide non-GAAP earnings measures, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS), that exclude non-operating pension costs consisting of interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains (losses) and curtailments and other one-time charges. In addition, the company's segment reporting will also present non-GAAP operating earnings which exclude non-operating pension costs and be identified as Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings. 2013 guidance is being provided for GAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS.
 
Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the financial statements that accompany this release. Quarterly and annual reconciliations of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings and an annual schedule of components of pension expense for the years 2010  2012 are provided in the Supplemental Financial Data document posted on A. O. Smith's website at www.aosmith.com/investorrelations.
Outlook for 2013
"With our strong North American replacement water heater business, growing Lochinvar boiler platform, and expanding global presence particularly in China, A. O. Smith is well positioned entering 2013," Rajendra observed. "Business conditions are continuing to improve modestly in the U. S., and we remain optimistic the growth exhibited by the housing market last year will carry over into this year as well."
"With a talented, disciplined team focused on serving our customers, we look forward to what we believe will be another strong year based on our earnings guidance. For 2013, we expect A. O. Smith Corporation to achieve full-year GAAP earnings of between $3.00 and $3.20 per share and Adjusted Earnings of between $3.25 and $3.45 per share, neither of which includes the potential impact from future acquisitions. "
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
Forward-looking statements

The company's earnings release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings, which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, this data is considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement the company's GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. The reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings to the most comparable GAAP measures follow.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS exclude non-operating related pension costs of the company's pension plan comprised of interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains (losses) and curtailment and other one-time charges. The service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of our pension plan are included in Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS. The company believes that these components of pension cost better reflect ongoing operating related costs of providing pension benefits to the company's employees. As such, the company believes that the measures of Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS provide management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of the company. Other components of GAAP pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and the company manages these separately from the operational performance of its businesses. Neither GAAP nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to the company's pension plan.
The following is a reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted Earnings from continuing operations (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP):
 
Beginning in 2013, the company is defining Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings to exclude non-operating pension costs comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains (losses) and curtailment and other one-time charges. The company will continue to include service cost and amortization of prior service cost in the business segment that incurred the expense.
The following is a reconciliation of reported segment earnings to Adjusted Segment Operating Earnings (non-GAAP):

Exhibit Index to Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 23, 2013
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
April 23, 2013
A. O. Smith reports record first quarter sales, increases 2013 outlook
Water technology company A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE-AOS) today announced first quarter net earnings of $39.0 million or $.84 per share on record sales of $509.6 million.
Milwaukee, Wis.
First quarter 2013 adjusted earnings of $44.7 million or $.96 per share excluded an after-tax restructuring and impairment charge of $9.5 million or $.20 per share related to the previously announced closing of a residential water heater manufacturing facility in Canada, an after-tax gain of $6.8 million or $.14 per share related to a settlement with a former supplier, and after-tax non-operating pension costs of $3.0 million or $.06 per share. First quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of $31.7 million or $.68 per share excluded an after-tax gain of $16.8 million or $.36 per share related to the sale of Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE-RBC) shares received from the 2011 divestiture of the company's electric motor business and after-tax non-operating pension costs of $1.0 million or $.02 per share.
To provide improved transparency into the operating results of its business, effective with this first quarter of 2013, the company is providing non-GAAP measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, and adjusted segment operating earnings) that exclude certain items, as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains (losses), and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis.
Reconciliations of adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings to net earnings, EPS, and segment operating earnings on a GAAP basis are provided in the attachments to this press release.
First quarter sales grew approximately nine percent compared with the same period in 2012 due to improved volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U. S., as well as higher sales in China.
"Our business is off to a very strong start this year," Ajita G. Rajendra, president and chief executive officer, observed. "Our U. S. residential and commercial water heater volumes benefitted from improved economic conditions, and our Lochinvar product line continued to perform very well."
"A. O. Smith branded product sales in China grew approximately 15 percent, on track with our stated objective to grow at a rate of two times the GDP growth rate in that country."
North America segment
First quarter sales for the North America segment, which includes U. S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers, increased 7.2 percent to $378.7 million compared with first quarter 2012 sales of $353.3 million. Increased volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U. S. and higher boiler volumes contributed to the increase.
Segment operating earnings of $54.1 million were higher than the $42.2 million earned in the first quarter last year. First quarter adjusted segment operating earnings of $59.4 million were 37.5 percent higher than adjusted segment operating earnings of $43.2 million in the same period last year and excluded pre-tax non-operating pension costs of $3.6 million in the current period and $1.0 million in the year-ago period. The current period also excluded the restructuring charge of $12.7 million and income from a settlement with a former supplier of $11.0 million. Higher volumes and improved pricing associated with a price increase effective in the second quarter of last year contributed to the profit increase. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 15.7 percent was higher than the 2012 adjusted operating margin of 12.2 percent.
Rest of World segment
Sales of this segment, which includes China, India, and Europe, increased 11.4 percent in the first quarter to $138.3 million. Sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew approximately 15 percent primarily due to a higher-priced product mix in the region as a result of product introductions with more robust features and benefits, as well as pricing actions in the second quarter of 2012.
 
Operating earnings for this segment increased 28.2 percent to $18.2 million compared with $14.2 million earned in the 2012 first quarter. Higher sales and below-normal promotion expenses due to the New Year holiday in China and reduced losses in the non-A. O. Smith branded water treatment business were partially offset by larger expenses in India related to the expansion of distribution to new cities and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the seasonality of sales. Operating margin of 13.2 percent improved from the first quarter 2012 margin of 11.4 percent.
Restructuring activity
On March 28, 2013, the company's board of directors approved a plan to transfer residential water heater production from its Fergus, Ontario, plant to other North American facilities. The company expects that the majority of its production will be consolidated by July 1. As a result of the capacity rationalization, the company incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $12.7 million in the first quarter related to employee severance costs and impairment of long-lived assets. Additional restructuring charges are expected to total approximately $5 million for the remainder of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, operating savings related to the plant rationalization will offset operating inefficiencies in 2013. The company expects pre-tax annual savings of approximately $10 million in 2014.
Cash, Leverage and Share Buyback
Total debt as of March 31, 2013 was $229.1 million, resulting in leverage of 15.6 percent as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. Cash and investments, located largely outside the U. S., totaled $451.4 million at the end of the quarter.
During the first quarter, the company repurchased 50,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $69.70 per share, representing a total of $3.5 million. A total of approximately 412,000 shares remain in the existing repurchase authority.
Outlook for 2013
"Business conditions appear to be improving in the U. S., and new residential construction is beginning to show some signs of life for the first time in five years," Rajendra said. "Any increase in housing construction should complement our strong replacement water heater business."
 
"Our international business, especially our A. O. Smith branded products in China, continues to grow as a result of new product introductions with more robust features and benefits that provide value to our customers. Our investment in new product development continues to play a key role in our success in China."
"As a result of these positive factors, we are increasing our guidance for 2013. We believe A. O. Smith Corporation will achieve full-year GAAP earnings of between $3.00 and $3.16 per share and, we now believe we will achieve adjusted earnings of between $3.40 and $3.56 per share, neither of which includes the potential impact from future acquisitions. The adjusted earnings per share projection excludes the gain from the settlement with a former supplier, the restructuring charges related to the plant rationalization in Canada and non-operating pension costs."
The full-year earnings and adjusted earnings estimates are based on the number of outstanding shares prior to the impact of the 2-for-1 stock split that the company announced last week.
A. O. Smith will broadcast a live conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) today. The call can be heard on the company's web site, www.aosmith.com. An audio replay of the call will be available on the company's web site after the live event.
