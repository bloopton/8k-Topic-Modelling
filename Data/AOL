On November 19, 2009, AOL Inc. (the "Company") informed its employees of proposed restructuring activities as part of its continuing cost reduction initiatives aimed at aligning the Company's organizational structure and costs with its strategy (the "Restructuring"). The Restructuring is conditioned upon the successful completion of the Company's previously announced spin-off from Time Warner Inc. (the "Spin-off"), as well as the approval of the Company's new Board of Directors that will begin service in connection with the Spin-off. It is anticipated that, if approved, the Restructuring will include the reduction of approximately a third of the Company's current employee base, which will be conducted on a voluntary and involuntary basis. The goal of the Restructuring is to reduce ongoing annual operating costs by approximately $300 million. If the Restructuring is approved, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of up to $200 million, substantially all of which is expected to be incurred from the date of the Spin-off through the first half of 2010.

Departure of Certain Directors; Election of Directors
On November 20, 2009, each of Jeffrey L. Bewkes and John K. Martin, Jr. delivered a conditional resignation as a member of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AOL Inc. (the "Company"), effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 8, 2009, the business day immediately prior to the date of the Company's previously announced spin-off (the "Spin-off") from Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"), and the Board appointed Richard L. Dalzell, Karen E. Dykstra, William R. Hambrecht, Susan M. Lyne, Patricia E. Mitchell, Michael K. Powell, James R. Stengel and James A. Wiatt as directors of the Company, effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2009.
On November 20, 2009, the Board also appointed Fredric G. Reynolds as a director of the Company and a member of the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board, in each case effective immediately prior to the date on which when-issued trading of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") commences on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). The Company anticipates that when-issued trading will commence as early as November 24, 2009, two trading days prior to the record date for the Spin-off.
The Board has not yet appointed any of Mr. Dalzell, Ms. Dykstra, Mr. Hambrecht, Ms. Lyne, Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Powell, Mr. Stengel or Mr. Wiatt to any committees of the Board. The Company will file an amendment to this report on Form 8-K naming additional committee appointments once they are determined.
Adoption of Certain Benefit Plans
On November 20, 2009, the Board adopted (i) the Company 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 SIP") and (ii) the Company Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the "Bonus Plan"), in each case contingent and effective upon the approval of such plans by the Company's stockholders, Time Warner and TW AOL Holdings LLC ("TW AOL Holdings"). In addition, on November 20, 2009, Time Warner and TW AOL Holdings approved the adoption of the 2010 SIP and the Bonus Plan.
2010 SIP
The 2010 SIP is designed to aid the Company and its affiliates in recruiting and retaining employees, directors and advisors and in motivating such individuals to exert their best efforts on behalf of the Company and its affiliates through the granting of awards under the 2010 SIP. Any of the Company's or its affiliates' employees, officers, consultants or directors is eligible to be granted one or more of the following types of awards under the 2010 SIP: (i) incentive stock options, (ii) non-qualified stock options, (iii) restricted stock awards, (iv) stock appreciation rights and (v) other stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units. The 2010 SIP includes the authority to grant awards that qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"). The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") has been designated as administrator of the 2010 SIP. Unless the 2010 SIP is sooner terminated by the Board, no awards may be granted under the 2010 SIP after the fifth anniversary of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Company's stockholders that occurs more than 12 months after the Spin-off, provided that awards that are outstanding on such date will remain valid in accordance with their terms.
 
The 2010 SIP provides that, subject to certain adjustments for certain corporate events, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued thereunder is equal to the sum of (i) 10,500,000, of which no more than 60% may be issued in the form of restricted stock awards or other stock-based awards that are payable in shares, plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares subject to the Converted Awards described below. Awards under the 2010 SIP are also subject to per-participant calendar year limits set forth in the 2010 SIP.
The 2010 SIP also provides that, effective upon the Spin-off, (i) each outstanding option to purchase Time Warner common stock held by Timothy W. Armstrong, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, immediately prior to the Spin-off will be converted into an option granted under the 2010 SIP to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Time Warner option (other than with respect to exercise price and the number and type of shares covered thereby), the number of shares of the Common Stock at the exercise price per share that will allow such option to have a "fair value" and an "intrinsic value" (in each case, within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Section 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC 718") and determined in accordance therewith), as of immediately following the Spin-off, that is identical to the fair value and intrinsic value of the Time Warner option immediately prior to the Spin-off and (ii) each outstanding restricted stock unit that was granted to Mr. Armstrong pursuant to any equity plan of Time Warner (a "TWX RSU"), that he holds immediately prior to the Spin-off, shall be converted into a restricted stock unit granted under the 2010 SIP, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such TWX RSU (other than with respect to the number and type of shares covered thereby), with respect to the number of shares of the Common Stock that will allow such restricted stock unit to have a "fair value" and an "intrinsic value" (in each case, within the meaning of FASB ASC 718 and determined in accordance therewith), as of immediately following the Spin-off, that is identical to the fair value and intrinsic value of such TWX RSU immediately prior to the Spin-off (the converted stock, options and restricted stock units, collectively, the "Converted Awards").
The foregoing description of the terms of the 2010 SIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2010 SIP, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Bonus Plan
The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to provide for the payment of annual bonuses to certain executive officers of the Company that qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and would be deductible by the Company.
The Bonus Plan provides that the Compensation Committee may, with respect to any calendar year, make an award to a participant under the Bonus Plan consisting of the payment of an annual cash bonus, a grant of restricted shares or restricted stock units, or any combination of the foregoing, if the Company generates positive "adjusted net income" (as defined in the Bonus Plan) for the applicable year. Any awards of restricted shares or restricted stock units made pursuant to the Bonus Plan will be issued under the 2010 SIP and will have a vesting schedule that is established in the award agreement under which the award is issued.
The Bonus Plan provides that, prior to paying any award under the Bonus Plan, the calculation of the Company's adjusted net income with respect to the applicable performance year will be reviewed by the Company's independent auditors and that the Compensation Committee will certify in writing that the performance goal for the applicable participant was met and that the amount of the award to any participant does not exceed the maximum amount payable under the Bonus Plan.
 
The maximum award payable to a participant with respect to any performance year will be equal to the lesser of 4% of the Company's adjusted net income for such year and $4 million. This limit on awards payable to each participant does not reflect the Compensation Committee's intention to pay awards at such maximum levels, but rather is intended to provide that the awards (particularly when consisting of a combination of a cash bonus and a grant of restricted stock units and/or restricted shares) will be deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Compensation Committee will have sole authority to determine the amount of any award and whether the award will be in the form of an annual cash bonus, restricted stock units or restricted shares (or a combination of the foregoing). Under the terms of the Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee has authority to exercise discretion to award any participant an amount that is less than the maximum amount payable pursuant to the Bonus Plan. Therefore, with respect to annual awards actually payable to participants for each calendar year, the Compensation Committee intends to determine the amount to be paid based upon the level of achievement of (i) pre-established Company financial goals that will not necessarily or solely be based on the Company's adjusted net income and (ii) where applicable, pre-established individual goals for each participant in the Bonus Plan.
Unless a participant elects to defer all or a portion of his or her award under a deferred compensation plan maintained by the Company, payments of cash bonuses under the Bonus Plan will be made between January 1 and March 15 of the calendar year following the applicable performance year, and as soon as practicable after the Compensation Committee certifies that (i) the performance goals have been met and (ii) the amount of the awards to any participant does not exceed the maximum amount payable in that performance year. The Company currently does not maintain a deferred compensation plan.
The Bonus Plan will continue in effect until terminated by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may amend the Bonus Plan from time to time as it deems advisable, provided that any such amendment complies with all applicable laws and the requirements for exemption under the Code and any regulations or other legally binding guidance promulgated thereunder.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Bonus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bonus Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

In addition, the Committee may delegate the authority to grant Awards under the Plan to any employee or group of employees of the Company or an Affiliate; provided that such grants are consistent with guidelines established by the Committee from time to time.
(b)        The Committee shall have the full power and authority to make, and establish the terms and conditions of, any Award to any person eligible to be a Participant, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, and to waive any such terms and conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions).
(c)        The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan, and may delegate such authority, as it deems appropriate. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent the Committee
deems necessary or desirable. Any decision of the Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, Participants and their beneficiaries or successors).
(d)        The Committee shall require payment of any amount it may determine to be necessary to withhold for federal, state, local or other taxes as a result of the exercise, grant or vesting of an Award.

Such cancellation and exchange would be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Participant.
(c)        With respect to any Awards granted to a Participant who is a non-employee member of the Board at the time of grant, such Awards shall be made pursuant to formulas established by the Board in advance of such grant. Any such Awards shall be made at the time such a Participant first becomes a member of the Board and, thereafter, on an annual basis at or following the annual meeting of stockholders. Such formulas may include any one or more of the following: (i) a fixed number of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, (ii) a fixed number of Shares of Restricted Stock or a number of Shares of Restricted Stock determined by reference to a fixed dollar amount (calculated based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant), and (iii) Other Stock-Based Awards determined either by reference to a fixed number of Shares or to a fixed dollar amount (calculated based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant).
 
Options granted under the Plan shall be, as determined by the Committee, nonqualified or incentive stock options for federal income tax purposes, as evidenced by the related Award agreements, and shall be subject to the foregoing and the following terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent therewith, as the Committee shall determine, and as evidenced by the related Award agreement:
(a)         The Option Price per Share shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date an Option is granted.
Option Price.
(b)         Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted, except as may be provided pursuant to Section 15.
Exercisability.
(c)         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable. For purposes of this Section 6, the exercise date of an Option shall be the date a notice of exercise is received by the Company, together with provision for payment of the full purchase price in accordance with this Section 6(c). The purchase price for the Shares as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Company, as designated by the Committee, pursuant to
Exercise of Options.
one or more of the following methods: (i) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by check); (ii) in Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee; (iii) partly in cash and partly in such Shares or (iv) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to an Option until the Shares are issued to the Participant.
(d)         The Committee may grant Options under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs. Such ISOs shall comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code (or any successor section thereto). No ISO may be granted to any Participant who, at the time of such grant, owns more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary, unless (i) the Option Price for such ISO is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the ISO is granted and (ii) the date on which such ISO terminates is a date not later than the day preceding the fifth anniversary of the date on which the ISO is granted. Any Participant who disposes of Shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO either (i) within two years after the date of grant of such ISO or (ii) within one year after the transfer of such Shares to the Participant, shall notify the Company of such disposition and of the amount realized upon such disposition. All Options granted under the Plan are intended to be nonqualified stock options, unless the applicable Award agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an ISO. If an Option is intended to be an ISO, and if for any reason such Option (or portion thereof) shall not qualify as an ISO, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option (or portion thereof) shall be regarded as a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan; provided that such Option (or portion thereof) otherwise complies with the Plan's requirements relating to nonqualified stock options. In no event shall any member of the Committee, the Company or any of its Affiliates (or their respective employees, officers or directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other person) due to the failure of an Option to qualify for any reason as an ISO.
ISOs.
(e)         Wherever in the Plan or any agreement evidencing an Award a Participant is permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option or taxes relating to the exercise of an Option by delivering Shares, the Participant may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Committee, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof of beneficial ownership of such Shares, in which case the Company shall treat the Option as exercised without further payment and/or shall withhold such number of Shares from the Shares acquired by the exercise of the Option, as appropriate.
Attestation.
 
(a)         The Committee may grant (i) a Stock Appreciation Right independent of an Option or (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right in connection with an Option, or a portion thereof. A Stock Appreciation Right granted pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence (A) may be granted at the time the related Option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise or cancellation of the related Option, (B) shall cover the same number of Shares covered by the Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Committee may determine) and (C) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Option except for such additional limitations as are contemplated by this Section 7 (or such additional limitations as may be included in an Award agreement).
Grants.
(b)         The exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be an amount determined by the Committee but in no event shall such amount be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, the exercise price may not be less than the Option Price of the related Option. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted independent of an Option shall entitle a Participant upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the exercise price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Stock Appreciation Right. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, shall entitle a Participant to surrender to the Company the unexercised Option, or any portion thereof, and to receive from the Company in exchange therefor an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the Option Price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered. Payment shall be made in Shares or in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash (any such Shares valued at such Fair Market Value), all as shall be determined by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised from time to time upon actual receipt by the Company of written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. The date a notice of exercise is received by the Company shall
Terms.
be the exercise date. No fractional Shares will be issued in payment for Stock Appreciation Rights, but instead cash will be paid for a fraction or, if the Committee should so determine, the number of Shares will be rounded downward to the next whole Share. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by Stock Appreciation Rights until the Shares are issued to the Participant.
(c)         The Committee may impose, in its discretion, such conditions upon the exercisability of Stock Appreciation Rights as it may deem fit, but in no event shall a Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted, except as may be provided pursuant to Section 15.
Limitations.
 
(a)         Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine the number of Shares of Restricted Stock to be granted to each Participant, the duration of the period during which, and the conditions, if any, under which, the Restricted Stock may be forfeited to the Company, and the other terms and conditions of such Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision, with respect to (i) Shares of Restricted Stock that are subject to time-based vesting, but not performance-based vesting, not less than 95% of such Shares of Restricted Stock shall remain subject to forfeiture for at least three years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination of such potential for forfeiture in whole or in part in the event of a Change in Control or the death, disability or other termination of the Participant's employment, and (ii) Shares of Restricted Stock that are subject to vesting upon the attainment of performance objectives, the minimum performance period shall be one year.
Grant.
(b)         Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except as provided in the Plan or the applicable Award agreement. Shares of Restricted Stock may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. If certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the applicable Participant, the Company may, at its discretion, retain physical possession of such certificates until such time as all applicable restrictions lapse.
Transfer Restrictions.
(c)         Dividends paid on any Shares of Restricted Stock may be paid directly to the Participant, withheld by the Company subject to vesting of the Restricted Shares pursuant to the terms of the applicable Award agreement, or may be reinvested in additional Shares of Restricted Stock, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
Dividends.
(d)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, certain Shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Section 8 may, at the discretion of the Committee, be granted in a manner which is intended to be deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto). The restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse based wholly or partially on the attainment of written performance goals approved by the Committee for a performance period of not less than one year established by the Committee (i) while the outcome for that performance period is substantially uncertain and (ii) no more than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period to which the performance goal relates or, if less, the number of days which is equal to 25 percent of the relevant performance period. The performance goals, which must be objective, shall be based upon one or more of the criteria set forth in Section 9(b) below. The criteria may relate to the Company, one or more of its Affiliates or one or more of its or their divisions or units, or any combination of the foregoing, and may be applied on an absolute basis and/or be relative to one or more peer group companies or indices, or any combination thereof, all as the Committee shall determine. In addition, to the degree consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto), the performance goals may be calculated without regard to extraordinary items. The Committee shall determine whether, with respect to a performance period, the applicable performance goals have been met with respect to a given Participant and, if they have, shall so certify prior to the release of the restrictions on the Shares. No such restrictions shall lapse for such performance period until such certification is made by the Committee.
Performance-Based Grants.
9.
Other Stock-Based Awards
(a)         The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell Awards of Shares and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares, including, but not limited to, Shares awarded purely as a bonus and not subject to any restrictions or conditions, Shares in payment of the amounts due under an incentive or performance plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or an Affiliate, performance units, dividend equivalent units, stock equivalent units, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine the number of Shares to be awarded to a Participant under (or otherwise related to) such Other Stock-Based Awards; whether such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares; and all other terms and conditions of such Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Shares so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable). Notwithstanding any other provision, with respect to (i) Other Stock-Based Awards settled in Shares that are subject to time-based vesting, but not performance-based vesting (other than any Converted Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards that are granted pursuant to an obligation set forth in an employment agreement with an executive officer of the Company that was entered into prior to October 1, 2009), not less than 95% of such Other Stock-Based Awards payable in Shares shall vest and become payable at least three years after the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in whole or in part in the event of a Change in Control or the death, disability or other termination of the Participant's employment, and (ii) Other Stock-Based Awards settled in Shares that are subject to vesting upon the attainment of performance objectives, the minimum performance period shall be one year.
Generally.
(b)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, certain Other Stock-Based Awards granted under this Section 9 may be granted in a manner which is intended to be deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto). A Participant's Performance-Based Award shall be determined based on the attainment of written performance goals approved by the Committee for a performance period of not less than one year established by the Committee (i) while the outcome for that performance period is substantially uncertain and (ii) no more than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period to which the performance goal relates or, if less, the number of days which is equal to 25% of the relevant performance period. The performance goals, which must be objective, shall be based upon one or more of the following criteria: (i) operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA"), including adjusted OIBDA; (ii) operating income; (iii) earnings per share; (iv) return on stockholders' equity; (v) revenues or sales; (vi) free cash flow; (vii) return on invested capital, (viii) total stockholder return, (ix) net sales or revenue growth, (x) return on assets, (xi) return on capital, (xii) return on sales, (xiii) return on revenue, (xiv) operating cash flow, (xv) cash flow return on equity, (xvi) cash flow return on investment, (xvii) earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation, and/or amortization, (xviii) gross or operating margins, (xix) productivity ratios, (xx) expense targets, (xxi) margins, (xxii) operating efficiency, (xxiii) market share, (xxiv) working capital targets and change in working capital, and/or (xxv) economic value added (net operating profit after tax minus the sum of capital multiplied by the cost of capital). The foregoing criteria may relate to the Company, one or more of its Affiliates or one or more of its or their divisions or units, or any combination of the foregoing, and may be applied on an absolute basis and/or be relative to one or more peer group companies or indices, or any combination thereof, all as the Committee shall determine. In addition, to the degree consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto), the performance goals may be calculated without regard to extraordinary items. The Committee shall determine whether, with respect to a performance period, the applicable performance goals have been met with respect to a given Participant and, if they have, shall so certify and ascertain the amount of the applicable Performance-Based Award. No Performance-Based Awards will be paid for such performance period until such certification is made by the Committee. The amount of the Performance-Based Award actually paid to a given Participant may be less than the amount determined by the applicable performance goal formula, at the discretion of the Committee. The amount of the Performance-Based Award determined by the Committee for a performance period shall be paid to the Participant at such time as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion after the end of such performance period; provided, however, that a Participant may, if and to the extent permitted by the Committee and consistent with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code and Section 19 below, elect to defer payment of a Performance-Based Award.
Performance-Based Awards.
(a)     Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to all Awards granted under the Plan:
    Adjustments Upon Certain Events.
(i)         In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares (including, without limitation, the value thereof) after the Effective Date by reason of any Share dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of Shares or other corporate exchange, or any distribution to stockholders of Shares other than regular cash dividends, or any transaction similar to the foregoing, the Committee in its sole discretion and without liability to any person shall make such substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems to be equitable (subject to Section 19), as to (i) the number or kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan or pursuant to outstanding Awards, (ii) the maximum number of Shares for which Awards (including limits established for Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards) may be granted during a calendar year to any Participant, (iii) the Option Price or exercise price of any Stock Appreciation Right and/or (iv) any other affected terms of such Awards.
Generally.
(ii)         In the event of a Change in Control after the Effective Date, the Committee may (subject to Section 19), but shall not be obligated to, (A) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to, all or any portion of an Award, (B) cancel Awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) which, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, may equal the excess, if any, of value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to holders of the same number of Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (or, if no consideration is paid in any such transaction, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) over the aggregate exercise price of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, (C) provide for the issuance of substitute Awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or (D) provide that for a period of at least 30 days prior to the Change in Control, such Options shall be exercisable as to all Shares subject thereto and that upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, such Options shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.
Change in Control.
(b)         The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume any outstanding award granted by the Company, any of its Affiliates or another company, whether in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, combination, consolidation or acquisition of property or stock or otherwise, by either: (A) granting an Award under the Plan in substitution of such award or (B) assuming such award as if it had been granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under the Plan. Such substitution or assumption will be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan if the granting company had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes an award pursuant to this Section 10(b), the terms and conditions of such award will remain unchanged (that the exercise price and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option may be granted with a similarly adjusted Option Price. The number of Shares underlying Substitute Awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
Substitute Awards.
except
 
The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Company or any Affiliate to continue the Employment of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect the Company's or Subsidiary's right to terminate the Employment of such Participant. No Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee's determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated).
The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and a Participant, including without limitation, the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant's creditors.
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee (and subject to the limitation that in no circumstances may an Award may be transferred by the Participant for consideration or value), an Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. An Award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant.
 
The Board or the Committee may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made, (a) without the approval of the stockholders of the Company (i) if such action would (except as is provided in Section 10 of the Plan) increase the total number of Shares reserved for the purposes of the Plan or increase the maximum number of Shares of Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards that may be awarded hereunder, or the maximum number of Shares for which Awards may be granted to any Participant, or (ii) if stockholder approval for such action is otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation or the rules of the NYSE or any successor exchange or quotation system on which the Shares may be then listed or quoted or Section 162(m) of the Code (taking into consideration the exception provided by Treas. Reg.  1.162-27(f)(iii)(4)), (b) without the consent of a Participant, if such action would diminish any of the rights of the Participant under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant under the Plan or (c) subject to Section 5(b), relating to repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, to permit such repricing; provided, however, that the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems necessary to permit the granting of Awards meeting the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent applicable, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan and Awards issued hereunder shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any amounts payable hereunder will be taxable to a Participant under Section 409A, prior to payment to such Participant of such amount, the Company may (a) adopt such amendments to the Plan and Awards and appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Committee determines necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided by the Plan and Awards hereunder and/or (b) take such other actions as the Committee determines necessary or appropriate to avoid the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A.
 
With respect to Participants who reside or work outside the United States of America and who are not (and who are not expected to be) "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan or Awards in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant, the Company or an Affiliate.
 
All Awards shall constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Participant for the purpose of determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, profit sharing, bonus, life insurance or other benefit plan of the Company or under any agreement between the Company and the Participant, unless such plan or agreement specifically provides otherwise.
The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws, and except as otherwise provided in the pertinent Award agreement, any and all disputes between a Participant and the Company or any Affiliate relating to an Award shall be brought only in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Manhattan, New York.
 
The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date; provided that any Awards granted under the Plan on or following the first regularly scheduled meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs more than 12 months after the Distribution shall be subject to the approval of the Plan by the then-existing stockholders of the Company.
 
(a)         The Plan is intended to be administered in a manner consistent with the requirements, where applicable only, of Section 409A. Where reasonably possible and practicable, the Plan shall be administered in a manner to avoid the imposition on Participants of immediate tax recognition and additional taxes pursuant to Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to any person in the event Section 409A applies to any Award in a manner that results in adverse tax consequences for the Participant or any of his beneficiaries or transferees.
In General.
(b)         No elective deferrals or re-deferrals of compensation (as defined under Section 409A) other than in regard to restricted stock units granted under the Plan are permitted hereunder.
Elective Deferrals.
(c)         To the extent an Award granted under the Plan is deemed to be "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A, the following rules shall apply to such Awards:
Applicable Requirements.
(i)         If the Company decides that the payment of compensation under the Plan shall be deferred within the meaning of Section 409A, then at the grant of the Award to which such payment relates, the Company shall specify in the Award Agreement the date(s) on which such compensation will be paid.
Mandatory Deferrals.
(ii)         For Awards of restricted stock units where the Participant is given the opportunity to elect the timing and form of the payment of the underlying Shares at some future time once any requirements have been satisfied (e.g., retirement), the Participant must make his or her initial deferral election for such Award in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A and Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2.
Initial Deferral Elections.
(iii)         To the extent the Company or Committee allows Participants to elect to re-defer (after an initial deferral election has become irrevocably effective) deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A, then the requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b) must be met. Generally those requirements provide that: (1) such election will not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which it is made; (2) in the case of an election not related to a payment on account of disability, death, or an unforeseeable emergency, the payment with respect to which such election is made must be deferred for a period of not less than 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been paid; and, (3) any election related to a payment at a specified time or pursuant to a fixed schedule (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(a)(4)) must be made not less than 12 months before the date the payment is scheduled to be paid.
Subsequent Deferral Elections.
(iv)        Payment(s) of compensation that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon an event or at a time set forth in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3. Generally, such events and times include: a Participant's separation from service; a Participant's becoming disabled; a Participant's death; a time or a fixed schedule specified in the Plan (including an Award Agreement); a change in the ownership or effective control, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets, of a corporation; or the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency, in each case as defined and provided for under Section 409A.
Timing of Payments.
(v)         Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an amount was intended to be paid such that it would have qualified as a short-term deferral under Section 409A, then such payment may be delayed without causing such amount to be subject to Section 409A if the requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) are met.
Certain Delayed Payments.
(vi)        Any payment made under the Plan to which Section 409A applies may not be accelerated, except in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4).
Acceleration of Payment.
(vii)         To the extent any amount made under the Plan to which Section 409A applies is payable in two or more installments, each installment payment shall be treated as a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Section 409A.
Installment Payments
.
(d)         In order to determine for purposes of Section 409A whether a Participant or eligible individual is employed by a member of the Company's controlled group of corporations under Section 414(b) of the Code (or by a member of a group of trades or businesses under common control with the Company under Section 414(c) of the Code) and, therefore, whether the Shares that are or have been purchased by or awarded under the Plan to the Participant are shares of "service recipient" stock within the meaning of Section 409A:
Determining "Controlled Group".
(i)        In applying Sections 1563(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Code for purposes of determining the Company's controlled group under Section 414(b) of the Code, the language "at least 50 percent" is to be used instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Code;
(ii)        In applying Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-2 for purposes of determining trades or businesses under common control with the Company for purposes of Section 414(c) of the Code, the language "at least 50 percent" is to be used instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-2; and
(iii)        Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the Company finds that legitimate business criteria exist within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(5)(E)(1), then the language "at least 50 percent" in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall instead be "at least 20 percent."
(e)         Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, in the event that an amount that is subject to Section 409A is to be paid under the Plan to a "specified employee" upon such employee's "separation from service" (as those terms are defined under Section 409A), then such payment shall be made on the first day of the seventh month following the month in which the separation from service occurred.
Specified Employees; Payment Delay.
This Appendix A shall apply to the Converted Awards granted to Timothy W. Armstrong ("Armstrong") pursuant to the AOL Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan ("Plan"), of which this Appendix A comprises a part.

3.1 For any calendar year, (i) prior to the beginning of each such calendar year, or (ii) at such later time as may be permitted by the Code and the Regulations for the Awards hereunder to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception, the Committee shall (x) select the executive officers of the Company and its affiliates who are eligible to receive an Award for such year and (y) establish the amount of the Award opportunity for each selected executive that is payable if the performance goals specified in Section 3.2 hereof are achieved. Unless a lesser Award opportunity amount is specified by the Committee for a Participant for a year, a Participant's Award opportunity for a year shall be the Maximum Award Amount. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the actual Award payable to a Participant for a year may be downward adjusted by the
Committee from the Award amount established for a Participant under this Section 3.1 in the Committee's complete discretion (including a downward adjustment to zero), as provided in Section 3.4 hereof.
3.2 The Committee may pay an Award to a Participant under the Plan for a year if the Company has positive Adjusted Net Income for such year. If positive Adjusted Net Income is not achieved for the year, no Award shall be payable to any Participant under the Plan for such year.
3.3 Following the close of the year for which the Committee has authorized Awards, the Committee shall determine whether the requirements under the Plan for payment of Awards for such year have been satisfied. Prior to paying any Award under the Plan, the Company's independent auditors shall review and verify the calculation of the Company's Adjusted Net Income for the applicable year. The Committee shall then certify, in writing, whether the performance goal was met within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations and determine the amount of the Awards that shall be paid to Participants in accordance with the Award opportunity established for each Participant pursuant to Section 3.1 and subject to the Committee's discretion to downward adjust Awards, as provided in Section 3.4.
3.4 Each Participant's actual Award amount shall then be determined by the Committee based upon (i) the Award opportunity previously established for the Participant pursuant to Section 3.1, and (ii) any downward adjustment that the Committee determines to make, such downward adjustment to be in the sole discretion of the Committee. In determining the amount of any downward adjustment, the Committee may give consideration to the contribution made by the Participant to achievement of the Company's established objectives and such other matters as it shall deem relevant in exercising such discretion. In no event may a Participant's Award exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of the Award opportunity previously established for the Participant (if the Award opportunity so established for such Participant pursuant to Section 3.1 for such year is less than the Maximum Award Amount), or (ii) the Maximum Award Amount.
3.5 Subject to Section 6 of the Plan, payments of an Award, if any, under the Plan with respect to any year, shall be made between January 1 and March 15 of the calendar year following the applicable performance year, and as soon as practicable after
4
 
the Committee certifies that the performance goals have been met and determines the actual Award amount for each Participant.
3.6 If the Committee has previously determined that payment of all or a portion of an Award shall be made in the form of RSUs or Restricted Stock, the Committee shall calculate the number of RSUs or shares of Restricted Stock, as applicable, that shall be credited to the Participant in payment of the Award based upon (i) the cash amount that would be payable to the Participant if the Award or the portion thereof to be made in the form of RSUs or Restricted Stock, as applicable, were instead paid in cash, and (ii) the value of an RSU or a share of Restricted Stock, as applicable, on the date of grant specified by the Committee.
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee or a subcommittee thereof. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan and the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall have plenary authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind the rules and regulations relating to it and to make, in its discretion, all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The determinations of the Committee on the matters referred to in this Section 4 shall be conclusive.
Each member of the Committee (or a subcommittee thereof, consisting of at least two individuals, established to administer the Plan) shall be an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the Regulations.
 
Payments of Awards with respect to any year may be made under the Plan only to a person who was a Participant during all or part of such year.
 
Each Participant may elect by written notice delivered to the Company at the time and in the form required by the Company to defer payment of all or any portion of a cash Award the Participant might earn with respect to a year, all in accordance with the Code and the Regulations and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may establish from time to time or as may be provided in any employment agreement between the Company and the Participant or in any deferred compensation plan maintained by the Company.
 
The Plan shall become effective upon the later of (i) approval by the Board and (ii) approval by Time Warner Inc. and TW AOL Holdings Inc., as the sole stockholders of the Company. The Plan shall remain in effect until such time as it is terminated by the Committee. The Plan shall apply to the annual bonuses payable to each Participant in respect of 2010 and thereafter; provided that any Awards paid under the Plan on or following the first regularly scheduled meeting of the stockholders of the Company that occurs more than 12 months after the
5
 
Distribution shall be subject to the approval of the Plan by the then-existing stockholders of the Company.
 
The Plan shall continue in effect until terminated by the Committee. The Committee may at any time modify or amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable; , that any such modification or amendment shall comply with all applicable laws and applicable requirements for exemption (to the extent necessary) under Section 162(m) of the Code and the Regulations (taking into consideration the exception provided by Section 1.162-27(f)(4)(iii) of the Regulations).
provided, however
 
The obligations of the Company to make payments under the Plan shall be subject to applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.
 
If any of the terms or provisions of the Plan conflict with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Regulations or applicable law, then such terms or provisions shall be deemed inoperative to the extent necessary to avoid the conflict with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Regulations or applicable law without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. With respect to Section 162(m), if the Plan does not contain any provision required to be included herein under Section 162(m) of the Code or the Regulations, such provision shall be deemed to be incorporated herein with the same force and effect as if such provision had been set out at length herein.
 
Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Committee or the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Committee or the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options, RSUs, or other stock-based awards, the payment of cash in an annual or long-term incentive arrangement or otherwise, or the payment or providing of other benefits outside of the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The payment or provision of certain of such incentive arrangements and benefits may or may not be deductible by the Company. None of the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to or incorporated in any employment agreement between the Company and any Participant.
 
Each Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive, in the event of such Participant's death, any payments of cash Awards remaining to be made to the Participant under the Plan. Each Participant shall have the right to revoke any such designation and to redesignate a beneficiary or beneficiaries by written notice to the Company to such effect. If any
6
 
Participant dies without naming a beneficiary or if all of the beneficiaries named by a Participant predecease the Participant, then any amounts of cash Awards shall be paid to the Participant's estate.
 
The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
 
The Plan shall not interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment at any time, and the Plan shall not confer upon any Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company. No person shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.
 
Whenever the Committee determines that all or a portion of an annual bonus shall be settled by an award of RSUs or shares of Restricted Stock, no fractional RSUs or shares of Restricted Stock will be awarded, but instead cash will be paid for a fraction or, if the Committee should so determine, the number of RSUs, or shares of Restricted Stock, as applicable, will be rounded downward to the next whole RSU or share of Restricted Stock, as applicable.
 
The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and will be interpreted in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. In furtherance thereof, no payments may be accelerated under the Plan other than to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of the Plan violates Section 409A of the Code such that amounts would be taxable to a Participant prior to payment or would otherwise subject a Participant to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be automatically reformed or stricken to preserve the intent hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of a Participant's termination of employment the Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company shall defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Participant) until the date that is six months following the Participant's termination of employment (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code) and (ii) if any other payments due to a Participant hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Committee, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. The Committee
7
 
shall implement the provisions of this section in good faith; provided that neither the Company, nor the Committee, nor any of Company's or its subsidiaries' employees or representatives, shall have any liability to Participants with respect to this section.

company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, and whether the basis of such action, suit or proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity or in any other capacity, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
SECTION 3. . Any indemnification under this Article VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VI, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the Stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VI or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
SECTION 4. . For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VI, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person was or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner, member or agent.

Expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by a current or former director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VI shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VI.
Expenses Payable in Advance
SECTION 6. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate, any agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VI shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The provisions of this Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VI but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL or otherwise.
Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
SECTION 7. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who was or is a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, or was or is serving at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee, partner, member or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.
Insurance
SECTION 8. . For purposes of this Article VI, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents so that any person who was or is a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or was or is serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner, member or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VI, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect of any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on,
Certain Definitions
 
or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VI.
SECTION 9. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
SECTION 10. . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VI to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification under this Article VI (which shall be governed by Section 11(b) of this Article VI), the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article VI to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
Limitation on Indemnification
SECTION 11. . (a) The obligations of the Corporation under this Article VI to indemnify a person who was or is a director or officer of the Corporation or was or is a director or officer of a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, including the duty to advance expenses, shall be considered a contract between the Corporation and such person, and no modification or repeal of any provision of this Article VI shall affect, to the detriment of such person, such obligations of the Corporation in connection with a claim based on any act or failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.
Contract Rights
(b) If a claim under Section 1, Section 2 or Section 5 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 90 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 45 days, the person making such claim may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, such person shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by such person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by such person to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that such person has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its Stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its Stockholders) that such person has not met such
 
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that such person has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by such person, be a defense to such suit.
SECTION 1. . The Board shall provide a suitable corporate seal, which shall bear, but not be limited to, the full name of the Corporation and shall be in the charge of the Secretary. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

Amendment of Employment Agreement of the Chief Executive Officer
On December 15, 2009, AOL Inc. (the "Company") and Timothy M. Armstrong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to Mr. Armstrong's employment agreement dated as of March 12, 2009 and effective as of April 7, 2009 (the "Armstrong Employment Agreement") among Mr. Armstrong, AOL LLC (the Company's predecessor in interest) and Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"). Following the previously disclosed legal and structural separation of the Company from Time Warner on December 9, 2009 (the "Spin-off"), the Company, as successor in interest, assumed all of AOL LLC's obligations under the Armstrong Employment Agreement and Time Warner ceased to have any obligations thereunder.
The Amendment provides that the Company will grant to Mr. Armstrong an award of stock options and restricted stock units (the "Replacement Awards") under the Company 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 SIP") to replace equity awards he was entitled to receive from Time Warner in 2010 pursuant to the Armstrong Employment Agreement if the Spin-off had not occurred.
Awards to the Chief Executive Officer
On December 15, the Compensation Committee of the Board of the Directors of the Company approved the grant of the Replacement Awards, effective as of January 4, 2010. The Replacement Awards will be comprised of (a) an option to purchase a number of shares of Company common stock determined by dividing (i) $5 million by (ii) the product of (x) the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, January 4, 2010 and (y) 0.3 (the "Replacement Option") and (b) a number of restricted stock units of the Company determined by dividing (i) $5 million by (ii) the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, January 4, 2010 (the "Replacement RSUs"). The Replacement Option will be evidenced by a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the "Replacement Option Agreement"), which, together with the 2010 SIP, will set for forth the terms and conditions of the Replacement Option, and the Replacement RSUs will be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Units Agreement (the "Replacement RSU Agreement"), which, together with the 2010 SIP, will set for forth the terms and conditions of the Replacement RSUs.
The exercise price for the Replacement Option will be the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, January 4, 2010. The Replacement Option will vest in eight quarterly installments over a two year period beginning on January 4, 2010.
Each Replacement RSU, once vested, entitles the holder to receive one share of the Company's common stock from the Company within 30 days of the relevant vesting date. The Replacement RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 4, 2011 and January 4, 2012, respectively.
Pursuant to the Armstrong Employment Agreement, the Company is also required to grant an option to purchase a certain number of shares of Company common stock in connection with the consummation of the Spin-off (the "Spin-off Option"). On December 15, 2009, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of the Spin-off Option under the 2010 SIP, effective as of December 31, 2009. The Spin-off Option will be evidenced by a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the "Spin-off Option Agreement"), which, together with the 2010 SIP, set forth the terms and conditions of the Spin-off Option.
 
The Spin-off Option will be comprised of an option to purchase a number of shares of Company common stock determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate value of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately after the Spin-off by (ii) the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, December 31, 2009.
The exercise price for the Spin-off Option will be the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, December 31, 2009. The Spin-off Option will vest over a three year period, with one third of the shares underlying the Spin-off Option vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Spin-off, respectively.
Chief Financial Officer and Named Executive Officer Awards
On December 15, 2009, the Compensation Committee also approved grants of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units under the 2010 SIP, effective as of December 31, 2009, to certain of the Company's Named Executive Officers, including Arthur Minson, Ira Parker and Tricia Primrose Wallace. With respect to Mr. Minson, the grants were made to satisfy contractual obligations under Sections 3.3.1 and 3.5.2 of the employment agreement dated August 24, 2009 (the "Minson Employment Agreement") between Mr. Minson and the Company (as successor in interest to AOL LLC). The options will be evidenced by a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreements, which, together with the 2010 SIP, will set forth the terms and conditions of the options, and the restricted stock units will be evidenced by Restricted Stock Units Agreements, which, together with the 2010 SIP, set forth the terms and conditions of the restricted stock units.
The exercise price for each option will be the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, December 31, 2009. The options will vest over a four year period in equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2009.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On December 16, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AOL Inc. (the "Company") approved a restructuring plan related to the Company's continuing cost reduction initiatives aimed at aligning the Company's organizational structure and costs with its strategy (the "Restructuring"). The Restructuring was previously announced on November 19, 2009, pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on such date. The Restructuring was conditioned upon the successful completion of the Company's previously announced spin-off from Time Warner Inc. (the "Spin-off"), as well as the approval of the Company's Board. The Spin-off was completed on December 9, 2009.
The Restructuring will include the reduction of approximately a third of the Company's current employee base, which will be conducted on a voluntary and involuntary basis. As of November 19, 2009, the Company employed approximately 7,000 people. As part of the Restructuring, the Company also intends to exit certain of its non-strategic business operations. Implementation of certain components of the Restructuring, including certain elements of the employee reductions and the exit of its non-strategic business operations, is subject to the satisfaction of applicable legal requirements.
The Company expects to incur restructuring charges of up to $200 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred through the end of 2009, with the remainder expected to be incurred through the first half of 2010. Included in the total restructuring charges are up to $150 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit costs and up to $50 million of charges related to facility closures and other costs. The Company expects substantially all of these charges to result in future cash expenditures.
In connection with the Restructuring described above, the Company also anticipates incurring non-cash asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the exit of certain of its non-strategic business operations described above. At this time, the Company is unable to make a determination of an estimate or range of estimates with respect to the anticipated non-cash impairment charges. As permitted, the Company will file an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Company's determination of such estimate or range of estimates.
Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
The information set forth under Item 2.05 of this Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the Restructuring is incorporated by reference in response to this Item 2.06.
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

These statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of the Company's management, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, including, but not limited to, possible changes in the size and components of the expected charge; and general economic conditions.

RSU Make Good Program
On January 27, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of the Directors of AOL Inc. (the "Company") approved a cash award program designed to compensate those employees of the Company who forfeited restricted stock units ("RSUs") of Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") upon the Company's legal and structural separation from Time Warner on December 9, 2009 (the "Spin-off"). The total value of an employee's forfeited RSUs will be determined by multiplying the total number of RSUs that would have vested on or prior to April 13, 2012 by $31.05, the average of the high and low market prices of Time Warner common stock on the date of the Spin-off. Eligible employees will receive 25% of their total forfeited RSU value on each of April 15, 2010 and April 15, 2011 and 50% of their total forfeited RSU value on April 13, 2012; provided, however, that such employees must be employed by the Company on a payment date in order to receive payment.
Accordingly, the following named executive officers of the Company will receive cash payments in the following amounts, provided they are employed by the Company on each of the following dates:
 
2009 Bonus Determinations
As previously disclosed, for 2009, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the Spin-off, the Company instituted a transitional bonus plan, the 2009 Global Bonus Plan (the "GBP"). The annual target incentive under the GBP was set as a percentage of base salary to be paid out over two separate bonus periods. The first bonus period, which accounted for 50% of the target award, ran from January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009, with a payout on July 15, 2009. The second bonus period, which accounted for the remaining 50% of the target award, ran from July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, with a payout to be made on or about March 15, 2010. Funding for the second bonus period was based upon achievement of Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow goals (each as defined for the GBP). On January 27, 2010, the Compensation Committee approved final funding for the GBP's second bonus period. While the Company did not achieve the 110% funding level, the Compensation Committee approved a bonus payment equal to 110% of the target award for the second bonus period due to the strategic and operational accomplishments of the Company over the past several months, plus, where applicable, an additional discretionary amount in respect of individual performance.
 
Accordingly, the Company's principal financial officer and the following named executive officers of the Company were awarded the following amounts for the second bonus period of the GBP:
 
 
Chief Executive Officer Bonus
Pursuant to his employment agreement with the Company, Tim Armstrong, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, is entitled to a bonus for 2009 of at least $1,500,000. On January 27, 2010, the Compensation Committee accepted the request of Mr. Armstrong to forego his bonus for 2009.
The GBP and Mr. Armstrong's employment agreement have been previously filed by the Company with the SEC as Exhibits 10.20 and 10.6, respectively, to Amendment No. 1 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10 filed on September 16, 2009. An amendment to Mr. Armstrong's employment agreement has also been previously filed by the Company with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 22, 2009.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Advertising revenue declines reflect continued declines in search queries and lower revenue per search, due primarily to a 27% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL subscribers, who tend to search more frequently and typically monetize at a higher rate than non-paying visitors. Advertising revenue was further impacted by declines in international display revenue, offset in part by growth in domestic display revenue. International display revenue declines reflect weakness in the U.K., Germany and France, while domestic display revenue grew slightly for the first time in eight quarters driven by growth in the Consumer Packaged Goods, Finance and Retail advertiser categories. Third Party Network advertising revenue decreased slightly for the quarter reflecting revenue declines in our international operations and the search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products, largely offset by growth in the core Advertising.com network. In Q4 2009, we began proactively de-emphasizing the search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products on the Third Party Network in order to focus and strengthen our efforts in display advertising solutions.
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the decline in subscribers noted above. Monthly average churn for the period was 3%, marking the lowest level of churn in at least a decade as the average tenure of the subscriber base continues to increase, ending the quarter at approximately 8 years.
Other revenue declined slightly versus the year-ago period, reflecting the absence of revenue in 2009 from transition support services agreements (which ended in 2008) related to the sales of our European access businesses. Other revenue consists primarily of fees from mobile carriers associated with our mobile email and instant messaging functions, licensing revenue from MapQuest's business-to-business services and revenue from AOL's ADTECH product.
Profitability
Q4 2009 Adjusted OIBDA declined at a higher rate than revenue, reflecting $107 million in restructuring costs due principally to our previously announced restructuring plans, which are intended to align our organizational
 
structure and costs with our strategy. Additionally, costs of revenues declined at a lower rate than revenue as decreases in network, product development and other costs of revenues related to our continued cost-reduction initiatives were partially offset by a 12% increase in traffic acquisition costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs relates primarily to an increase in personal computers shipped by a large distribution partner on which AOL paid on a per unit basis to serve as the default homepage. As of December 31, 2009, new shipments under this contract ceased. The change in operating income (loss) primarily reflects a $2.2 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in Q4 2008.
Tax
The effective tax rate for 2009 was 45.4%. The effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35%, due principally to state income taxes, the impact of uncertain tax positions and taxable distributions from foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for 2008 was (30.3%), which included the effect of the $2.2 billion goodwill impairment charge, the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of this charge, our effective tax rate for 2008 was 43.4%. The change in the effective tax rates for 2009, as compared to the prior year adjusted rate, was primarily due to taxable distributions from foreign jurisdictions.
Equity-Based Compensation
From the spin-off through January 15, 2010, AOL granted 4.0 million non-qualified stock options and 3.1 million restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees. The exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the RSUs are both equal to the closing price of AOL common stock on the date of grant. The range of the exercise prices of the stock options and the fair values of the RSUs was $23.28 to $23.91. In addition, effective with the spin-off, Time Warner RSUs and stock options held by AOL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were converted into 339,000 AOL RSUs and 469,000 AOL stock options with an exercise price of $11.90.
Cash Flow
Q4 2009 cash provided by operations was $134.3 million and Free Cash Flow was $94.6 million. Cash provided by operations and Free Cash Flow both declined approximately $60 million compared to Q4 2008, primarily due to payments related to the settlement of a legal matter and a Value Added Tax matter in France.
Subsequent Events
On January 22, 2010, we completed the acquisition of StudioNow, Inc., a provider of a proprietary digital platform that allows clients to create, produce, manage and distribute professional quality videos at scale, for aggregate consideration of $36.5 million, $15.0 million of which was paid through the issuance of approximately 595,000 shares of AOL common stock, with the remainder paid in cash, $14 million at the close and $7.5 million two years thereafter.
On January 29, 2010, we issued approximately 173,000 shares of AOL common stock to Polar Capital Group, LLC, in partial satisfaction of our contractual obligation to return our CEO's initial investment of approximately $4.5 million in Patch Media Corporation ("Patch"), which arose from our acquisition of Patch on June 10, 2009.

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate the performance of our business, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which are typically non-recurring in nature. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and product development costs. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and capitalized product development costs, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows. AOL has computed Free Cash Flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). Media Metrix estimates unique visitors based on a sample of Internet users in various countries (referred to as the "panel-only methodology"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Media Metrix has announced the availability of an alternate panel-centric hybrid' methodology ("Media Metrix 360") to estimate unique visitors, in order to account for 100 percent of a website's audience. We have elected to adopt this alternate methodology for domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media starting December 2009 and going forward. As a result, our domestic unique visitor numbers based on Media Metrix 360 will not be comparable to the estimates under the previous methodology. As Media Metrix 360 is not available for all months in the fourth quarter of 2009, average monthly unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported within this press release under the Media Metrix panel-only methodology for the fourth quarter of 2009. For comparison purposes, monthly domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported within this press release in Operating Metrics under both the Media Metrix 360 and panel-only methodology for the month of December 2009.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, we are not under any obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Information Statement filed as an exhibit to the registration statement on Form 10 (the "Information Statement"), as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer and technology-driven and rapidly changing interactive services business. This business is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Information Statement as well as, among other things: 1) a longer than anticipated continuation of the current economic slowdown or further deterioration in the economy; 2) decreased liquidity in the capital markets, including any reduction in the ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; 3) our borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility; 4) the impact of terrorist acts and hostilities; 5) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 6) the success of any cost reductions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 7) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; and 8) the failure to meet earnings expectations.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On April 22, 2010, Michael Powell provided notice to AOL Inc. (the "Company") that he has resigned effective immediately as a member of the Company's Nominating and Governance Committee (the "Committee"). Although New York Stock Exchange rules specifically provide a transition period for the Company to have non-independent directors serve as members of its Board committees, Mr. Powell indicated that he believed it was prudent for him to step down from the Committee at least until such time as he qualifies as an independent director. Mr. Powell will continue to serve as a director of the Company. The Company anticipates that the Board will fill the vacancy on the Committee at its next meeting by appointing one of the Company's current independent directors.

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released first quarter 2010 results today.
NEW YORK  April 28, 2010
"AOL continues to make progress against our long-term objective of becoming an internet growth company. Our results highlight the accomplishment of our first goal in AOL's turnaround which was to significantly reduce AOL's cost structure," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While our restructuring had an impact on Q1 advertising results, we are encouraged by the advertising market's recent strength. We are now entering the second phase of AOL's plan which is to greatly improve the consumer experience, scale the advertising systems and teams, and aggressively pursue our strategy in the marketplace."
 
 
Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
 
Advertising revenue reflects declines in search & contextual and display revenue from AOL Properties and lower revenue from the Third Party Network.
AOL Properties revenue reflects the continued declines in search queries, due primarily to a 26% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL subscribers (who tend to search more frequently than non-paying visitors) and the removal of various contextual links during the quarter. AOL Properties revenue also reflects declines in domestic and international display revenue. Domestic display revenue declines largely reflect a disruption in sales associated with a reorganization of the salesforce during the quarter. In addition, the decrease reflects a lower volume of AOL Properties inventory monetized through our network due primarily to efforts to improve the user experience by reducing the number of ad units displayed on a page. Domestic display advertising was further impacted by an approximate $4 million reduction in revenue from legacy advertising deals in certain commerce and content areas that have been de-emphasized. International display revenue declines include $5.8 million related to the disruptions associated with restructuring efforts in the U.K, continued declines from Bebo and the winding-down of operations in France and Germany.
Third Party Network advertising revenue decreased reflecting the shut down or winding down of operations in many of our international markets as well as the de-emphasis of the typically low margin domestic search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products, which began in Q4 2009 to focus our efforts in display advertising solutions. These Third Party Network declines were partially offset by growth in the core domestic Advertising.com network.
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the 26% decline in subscribers noted above. Monthly average churn for the period was 3.0%, as compared to 3.7% as of March 31, 2009, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to 9.1 years as of March 31, 2010, from 7.8 years as of March 31, 2009. The increase in paid tenure of subscribers is due largely to the cessation of large scale access subscriber acquisition campaigns.
Other revenue declined versus the year-ago period, reflecting the timing of fees earned from mobile carriers associated with our mobile email and instant messaging functions.
 
Profitability
Adjusted OIBDA declined reflecting the revenue declines discussed above, partially offset by lower restructuring, traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and personnel-related costs. Lower personnel related costs reflect reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring initiatives we began in 2009. TAC declined during the quarter due to a decline from a product distribution agreement with a large distribution partner, whereby payments were previously based on the number of personal computers shipped. Under the agreement, which was amended in Q1 2010, new distribution has ceased and payments going forward will be based on a percentage of the advertising revenue we earn on the associated co-branded website. In addition to the above cost declines, operating income also reflects a $27.4 million increase in amortization expense in Q1 2010, versus the year ago period, primarily due to the accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets upon reevaluation of their useful lives.
Tax
The effective tax rate for Q1 2010 was 47.2%. The effective tax rate in Q1 2010 was higher than the statutory rate of 35%, due principally to foreign deferred tax assets generated in Q1 2010 that are subject to a valuation allowance and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for Q1 2009 was 40.6%. The effective tax rate in Q1 2009 was higher than the statutory rate of 35%, due principally to state income taxes and the impact of uncertain tax positions and related interest, partially offset by the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The change in the effective tax rate for Q1 2010, as compared to the prior year adjusted rate, was primarily due to the change in foreign deferred tax assets that are subject to a valuation allowance and the expiration of the federal research and experimentation tax credit.
Equity-Based Compensation
From the spin-off through April 23, 2010, AOL granted 4.2 million non-qualified stock options and 3.4 million restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and directors. The exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the RSUs are both equal to the closing price of AOL common stock on the date of grant. The range of the exercise prices of the stock options and the fair values of the RSUs was $23.28 to $25.33. In addition, effective with the spin-off, Time Warner RSUs and stock options held by AOL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were converted into 339,365 AOL RSUs and 469,466 AOL stock options with an exercise price of $11.90. As of April 23, 2010, all of the unvested shares and options are dilutive.
Cash Flow
Q1 2010 cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow were $162.9 million and $125.1 million, respectively. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined $153.7 million and $153.2 million, respectively, compared to Q1 2009, due primarily to the decline in Adjusted OIBDA and $89 million in cash payments in Q1 2010 related to restructuring charges and employee bonuses expensed in 2009.
Discontinued Operations
On February 26, 2010, we completed the sale of buy.at to Digital Window Limited for approximately $16.4 million in net cash. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on this sale of $17.7 million ($6.1 million on an after-tax basis), calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the net assets sold (including goodwill allocated to the sale of $12.6 million) over the cash proceeds. The financial condition and results of operations of buy.at have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Subsequent Events
On April 28, 2010, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our ICQ operations for $187.5 million in cash (subject to working capital adjustments). The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals in Russia and Ukraine. Further, we are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives for Bebo, which could include a sale or shutdown of Bebo in 2010.
 
 
Webcast and Conference Call Information

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Basis of Presentation
The financial information for 2009 has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the financial information for 2010. This recast reflects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of buy.at as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate the performance of our business, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which are typically non-recurring in nature. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA
.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and product development costs. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and capitalized product development costs, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows. AOL has computed Free Cash Flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers.

Media Metrix has announced the availability of an alternate panel-centric hybrid' methodology ("Media Metrix 360") to estimate unique visitors, in order to provide a more accurate count of a website's audience. We have elected to adopt this alternate methodology for domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media starting December 2009 and going forward. As a result, our domestic unique visitor numbers based on Media Metrix 360 will not be comparable to the estimates under the previous methodology. For comparison purposes, domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported, in Operating Metrics within this press release, under both the Media Metrix 360 and panel-only methodology for the first quarter of 2010.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) decreased liquidity in the capital markets, including any reduction in the ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; 2) our borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility; 3) the impact of terrorist acts and hostilities; 4) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 5) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 6) asset impairments; 7) the success of any cost reductions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 8) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; and 9) the failure to meet earnings expectations.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As previously announced, AOL Inc. (the "Company") has been exploring strategic alternatives for its Bebo, Inc. ("Bebo") subsidiary including a sale or possible shutdown. The Company has completed this process and is today announcing the sale of substantially all the assets of Bebo to an affiliate of Criterion Capital Partners, LLC.
The Company currently anticipates that following this transaction it will treat the common stock of Bebo as worthless for U.S. income tax purposes. The Company's current U.S. income tax basis in Bebo is approximately $750 million. As a result of the anticipated worthless stock deduction for the common stock of Bebo under U.S. income tax law, the Company expects to record a deferred tax asset and corresponding benefit to its U.S. income tax provision in the second quarter of 2010 in a range of $275 million to $325 million. The Company's tax conclusion with respect to the common stock of Bebo is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, given the recent volatility in the Company's stock price and disposition activity, the Company will be required under generally accepted accounting principles to test the goodwill of its sole reporting unit for impairment in the second quarter of 2010.
Forward-Looking Statements

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released second quarter 2010 results today.
NEW YORK  August 4, 2010
"In the second quarter, we continued our efforts to successfully reposition AOL for growth and the Company is getting healthier every day," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Although we have much more significant goals for the future of AOL, we are pleased with this quarter's internal and external trends."
 
 
Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Advertising revenue declined $110.3 million versus Q2 2009 of which approximately $70 million related to AOL-implemented initiatives and comprises: $49.1 million in lower Third Party Network revenue associated with European shutdowns and de-emphasis of low margin search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products; $11.2 million in lower search and contextual revenue from our de-emphasis of contextual products and fewer queries in Germany and France; and $10.3 million in lower international display revenue related to reduced operations in Germany and France and declines from Bebo which we sold during the quarter.
Separate from the above, advertising revenue further reflects declines in search and contextual, display and Third Party Network revenue. Search and contextual revenue declines of $29.7 million include $22.2 million which reflects the impact of fewer domestic search queries, primarily related to a 25% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers, as well as a $7.5 million impact from fewer international queries. Domestic display advertising revenues reflect flat premium inventory sales compared to the prior year period, despite beginning Q2 2010 with a smaller pipeline, due to incremental revenue generated intra-quarter by AOL sales representatives, offset by the impact on sales of a salesforce reorganization in Q1 2010. Domestic display revenue declines of $7.9 million were due to the impact of less AOL Properties inventory monetized through our network, resulting primarily from our efforts to improve the user experience. The remaining Third Party Network revenue decline primarily reflects the effects of restructuring efforts in the UK.
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the 25% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers noted above. Monthly average churn for the period was 2.6%, as compared to 3.5% in the prior year period, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to 9 years this period from 8 years in the prior year period. Average revenue per user declined 1% year-over-year. The increase in paid tenure of subscribers is due largely to the cessation of large scale access subscriber acquisition campaigns.
Profitability
Adjusted OIBDA declined reflecting the revenue declines discussed above, partially offset by lower network-related costs, restructuring, Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) and personnel-related expenses. Lower personnel-related expenses reflect reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring initiatives we began in 2009. TAC
 
declined during the quarter reflecting the Q1 2010 amendment of an agreement with a large distribution partner. The decline in TAC also reflects lower partner revenue share in Europe associated with the cessation of operations in certain countries and reduced operations in France and Germany, as well as the de-emphasis of low margin advertising products. Operating income also reflects a $1,414.4 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in Q2 2010 and a $20.3 million decrease in depreciation expense in Q2 2010 versus the prior year period, partially due to accelerated depreciation in the prior year period resulting from the reevaluation of the useful lives of certain network assets in connection with a restructuring initiative.
Goodwill
During Q2 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell our ICQ operations and we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets of Bebo. At the same time, our net assets increased significantly due principally to an increase in cash and the $302.7 million deferred tax asset related to the anticipated Bebo worthless stock deduction. In addition, since April our stock price declined significantly. These events triggered the necessity under GAAP for an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2010. Based on our interim impairment analysis, we determined that, as of June 30, 2010, the carrying value of our goodwill was impaired and, accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,414.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010.
Tax
We recorded a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,340.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. Included in this loss was a goodwill impairment charge of $1,414.4 million, the majority of which is not deductible for income tax purposes. In addition, we recorded an income tax benefit of $269.3 million, of which $302.7 million is related to a deferred tax asset associated with the anticipated Bebo worthless stock deduction. This deferred tax asset is expected to be used to offset ordinary income and capital gains of the Company, which is expected to ultimately result in cash tax savings by offsetting future U.S. federal and state income tax obligations through the anticipated worthless stock deduction. As a result of these items, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 differs significantly from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0%.
Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations, including the effect of the deferred tax asset related to the anticipated worthless stock deduction and the goodwill impairment charge, was 20.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2010, as compared to 44.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2009. The effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily due to the effect of the anticipated worthless stock deduction and an increase in the U.S. benefit of foreign branch losses, partially offset by the effect of the goodwill impairment charge (the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes).
Equity-Based Compensation
As of June 30, 2010, AOL had 5.7 million non-qualified stock options and 3.5 million restricted stock units (RSUs) outstanding to employees and directors. The exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the RSUs are both equal to the closing price of AOL common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average exercise prices of the stock options and fair values of the RSUs were $22.58 and $23.55, respectively.
Cash Flow
Q2 2010 cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow were $152.7 million and $129.1 million, respectively. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined $120.6 million and $101.2 million, respectively, compared to Q2 2009, due primarily to the decline in Adjusted OIBDA and cash payments in Q2 2010 related to restructuring charges and employee bonuses incurred in prior periods and paid in Q2 2010.
 
Sale of Bebo, Inc. (Bebo)
On June 16, 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of Bebo, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $2.2 million. In our 2010 consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, we expect to treat the common stock of Bebo as worthless for U.S. income tax reporting purposes. We estimate our current U.S. income tax basis in Bebo to be $767.1 million. As a result of the anticipated worthless stock deduction for the common stock of Bebo under U.S. income tax law, we recorded a deferred tax asset and corresponding income tax benefit of $302.7 million in the second quarter of 2010. Following this transaction, we expect to continue to generate advertising revenues on AOL Properties from customers who previously purchased run of network advertising on Bebo properties and accordingly, under the accounting guidance for presentation of financial statements, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Bebo have not been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
Discontinued Operations
On July 8, 2010, we sold our ICQ operations for $187.5 million in cash (subject to working capital adjustments). We expect to record a pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately $120 to $130 million within discontinued operations, a portion of which may be deferred for up to twelve months following the sale related to our obligation to provide certain transition services. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of buy.at (disposed of in Q1 2010) and ICQ have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Subsequent Event
On July 30, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its investment in Kayak Software Corporation for $18.9 million in net cash proceeds. The Company expects to complete this sale in the third quarter of 2010, and expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $17.5 million on this sale.

The following items impacted the comparability of net income attributable to AOL Inc. for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 (unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts):
Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Basis of Presentation
The financial information for all prior periods presented has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the financial information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. This recast reflects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of buy.at and ICQ as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). Media Metrix estimates unique visitors based on a sample of internet users in various countries (referred to as the "panel-only methodology"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Media Metrix announced the availability of an alternate methodology (currently referred to as "panel-centric unified" or "Media Metrix 360") to estimate unique visitors, in order to provide a more accurate count of a website's audience, and has continued to refine this methodology. We adopted this alternate methodology for domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media starting December 2009 and going forward. As a result, our domestic unique visitor numbers based on Media Metrix 360 will not be comparable to the estimates under the previous methodology. For comparison purposes, domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported, in Operating Metrics within this press release, under both the Media Metrix 360 and panel-only methodology for the second quarter of 2010.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 3) asset impairments; 4) the success of any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 5) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 6) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 7) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 8) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; 9) our borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and 10) the impact of terrorist acts and hostilities.

Exhibit 99.1
New York, NY  September 8, 2010  AOL Inc. [NYSE: AOL] announced today that Jim Wiatt, former chairman and chief executive of the William Morris Agency, will assume the new role of strategic advisor to AOL.
Wiatt, who will report directly to Chairman and CEO Tim Armstrong, will advise the company on a wide range of issues, helping to expand AOL's development of content, partnerships and relationships across the entertainment and media worlds. Wiatt is stepping down from AOL's Board of Directors to take on the new role, which he will begin immediately.
"Jim has made outstanding contributions to the AOL Board, but we are grateful to now have more of his time creating partnerships for AOL as we expand our focus on developing original content," said Armstrong. "Jim moves among the great content creators of our day, and his expertise in recognizing opportunities and structuring relationships is exactly what we need."
"I believed in this company's vision from the moment I met Tim and the AOL team," said Wiatt. "This is a unique opportunity, and I am excited about working closely with Tim to deliver compelling results for our consumers and advertisers."
AOL aims to be the global leader in sourcing, creating, producing and delivering high-quality, trusted, original content to consumers. Existing content partnerships include Cambio (), a new online network founded with The Jonas Group and MGX Lab, which combines original programming with interactivity to offer "entertainment 2.0" for teens. AOL is also working with A Squared Entertainment LLC, a children's media company formed by industry and marketing veterans Andy Heyward and Amy Moynihan. A Squared and AOL have teamed to create purpose-driven entertainment brands for children featuring iconic personalities including Warren Buffett, Gisele Bndchen, Martha Stewart and the late Carl Sagan. This week, AOL and Telepictures Productions announced a partnership in which AOL and website will share promotion, traffic and content. The partnership will expose the show's site to the millions of AOL users who are in Ellen's key demographic of women ages 25 to 54. Additionally, the site's current audience, which has grown considerably over the last year, will be exposed to the depth of original content on AOL that is created for this same demographic.

"At AOL, we want to delight consumers with content that's high quality, high impact and highly creative. We want consumers turning to the Web for entertainment that's as good, or better, than anything they can find offline and that fits their increasingly multi-screen lifestyle," said Armstrong.
Wiatt has worked as an independent consultant since June 2009. He previously served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the William Morris Agency from 1999 until 2009, overseeing all areas of the entertainment company, including motion picture, television, music, publishing, theater, digital, sports marketing, business development, investments and corporate consulting. Before joining WMA, Wiatt was Co-Chairman and Co-CEO of International Creative Management, a talent management company. A graduate of the University of Southern California, Wiatt is a member of the Board of Councilors of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, former Chairman and current member of the Board of the Los Angeles Police Foundation and on the Board of Directors of the Music Center of Los Angeles.

ITEM: Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On September 30, 2010 (the "Termination Date"), AOL Inc. (the "Company") terminated its secured credit agreement, dated December 9, 2009 (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent") and the other financial institutions party thereto for a 364-day revolving $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility").
The Company terminated the Revolving Credit Facility given its current cash balance and projected cash flow from operations. From December 9, 2009 through the Termination Date, the Company did not borrow under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility was set to expire on December 8, 2010, and the Company did not pay any penalties as a result of the early termination.
Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company was required to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (being the ratio of total debt to EBITDA, in each case, as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 1.5 to 1.0, and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (being the ratio of EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, in each case, as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least 4.0 to 1.0. Other material terms of the Revolving Credit Facility included:
 
 
 
The foregoing description of the Revolving Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on December 11, 2009 (the "Form 8-K") and is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, on December 9, 2009, each of the Company's material, wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") entered into a Guarantee, in favor of the Administrative Agent (the "Subsidiary Guarantee"), pursuant to which the Subsidiary Guarantors guaranteed all of the Company's obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, Time Warner guaranteed all of the Company's obligations with respect to loans and letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility, pursuant to a Guarantee, dated as of December 9, 2009, in favor of the Administrative Agent (the "Time Warner Guarantee"). As consideration for the Time Warner Guarantee, the Company paid Time Warner a fee equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the commitments at closing under the Revolving Credit Facility, and an ongoing guarantee fee, which varied with the amount of undrawn commitments and the principal amount of the Company's obligations outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as changes in Time Warner's senior unsecured long-term debt credit ratings. The guarantee fee was subject to prescribed periodic increases over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 
On December 9, 2009, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors also entered into a Security Agreement in favor of Bank of America, N.A., as collateral agent (the "Security Agreement"), for the benefit of the secured parties thereunder. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Subsidiary Guarantee were secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors (excluding cash and real property, but including 100% of the stock of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' first-tier domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of their first-tier foreign subsidiaries).
In connection with the Security Agreement, on December 9, 2009, the Company and certain of the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into a Patent Security Agreement and a Trademark Security Agreement, in each case, in favor of Bank of America, N.A., as collateral agent, for the purpose of recording the security interest granted under the Security Agreement to the collateral agent in the United States Patents (as defined in the Security Agreement) and United States Trademarks (as defined the Security Agreement) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the Subsidiary Guarantee, the Security Agreement, the Patent Security Agreement and Trademark Security Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the "Ancillary Agreements.") In connection with the termination of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company also terminated the Time Warner Guarantee and each of the Ancillary Agreements on the Termination Date.
The foregoing descriptions of the Ancillary Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, which were attached as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, to the Form 8-K, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On October 29, 2010, AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "PSA") with RT Pacific Blvd, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and a subsidiary of CB Richard Ellis Realty Trust (the "Buyer"), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to sell to the Buyer the four office buildings (including all related personal property, fixtures and improvements) located at 22110 Pacific Boulevard, 22260 Pacific Boulevard, 22265 Pacific Boulevard, 22270 Pacific Boulevard, and two parcels of undeveloped land located at 22275 Pacific Boulevard and 22341 Dresden Street in Dulles, Virginia that collectively form the eastern portion of the Company's Dulles, VA campus ("Pacific Corporate Park"), for a purchase price of $144.5 million in cash, exclusive of customary closing costs.The combined total office space of Pacific Corporate Park is approximately 700,000 rentable square feet and the two parcels of undeveloped land total approximately 22 acres. The PSA contains customary terms relating to, among other things, the condition of the title to the properties, environmental conditions, representations and warranties, closing conditions and apportionment of costs, such as taxes and fees. In addition, the Buyer has delivered a deposit of $7.5 million into an escrow account upon the execution of the PSA that is refundable in the event certain closing conditions are not met. The Company currently expects to close the sale of Pacific Corporate Park on or about November 15, 2010. As of October 29, 2010, pro forma for the sale of Pacific Corporate Park, the Company has approximately $750 million of cash on hand.
AOL will file a copy of the PSA as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released third quarter 2010 results today.
NEW YORK  November 3, 2010
"AOL is working hard to redefine the consumer experience on the internet," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In Q3, AOL continued on the path towards better health through targeted acquisitions and smart dispositions, meaningful product improvements, site relaunches, and strategic partnerships, all of which will enable us to execute more quickly against our strategy."
 
 
Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Advertising revenue declined $109.5 million versus Q3 2009 of which $62.3 million related to AOL-implemented initiatives and comprises: $46.9 million in lower Third Party Network revenue associated with European shutdowns and de-emphasis of low margin search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products; $8.1 million in lower search and contextual revenue from our de-emphasis of contextual products and fewer queries in Germany and France where we have reduced operations; and $7.3 million in lower international display revenue related to reduced operations in Germany and France and the absence of revenue from Bebo which we sold in Q2 2010.
Apart from the impacts of AOL-implemented initiatives, advertising revenue further reflects declines in search and contextual, display and Third Party Network revenue. Search and contextual revenue declines of $31.1 million include $20.2 million reflecting the impact of lower domestic queries, due to a 24% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and lower traffic on AOL Properties, as well as a $10.9 million impact from fewer international queries. Domestic display revenue declines of $9.3 million reflect a slight decline in premium inventory sales as well as less AOL Properties inventory monetized through our network, resulting primarily from our efforts to improve the consumer experience. Premium inventory sales declines reflect the fact that the Company began Q2 2010 with a significantly smaller pipeline, due to the impact on sales of a salesforce reorganization in Q1 2010, which was largely offset by incremental revenue generated intra-quarter.
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the 24% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers noted above. Monthly average churn for the period was 2.6%, as compared to 3.3% in the prior year period, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to 9 years this period from 8 years in the prior year period. Average revenue per user declined 2% year-over-year.
Other revenues decreased due to lower revenues from mobile messaging services, partially offset by increases in third party web hosting revenues and increases in transition services revenue associated with recent dispositions.
 
 
Profitability
Adjusted OIBDA declined reflecting the revenue declines discussed above, partially offset by lower Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), personnel-related expenses, network-related costs, and lower expense related to the resolution of a French value-added tax (VAT) matter in 2009. TAC declined $69.0 million year-over-year reflecting lower partner revenue share in Europe associated with the cessation of operations in certain countries and reduced operations in France and Germany, as well as the de-emphasis of low margin advertising products. The decline in TAC also reflects the Q1 2010 amendment of a large distribution agreement. Lower personnel-related expenses continue to reflect reduced headcount resulting from the restructuring initiatives we began in 2009. Operating income also reflects a $26.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q3 2010 versus the prior year period, primarily due to a higher percentage of in-service assets being fully depreciated and certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in periods prior to Q3 2010.
Tax
Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was a benefit of 5.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to an effective tax rate of 40.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2009. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2010 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to the effect of the goodwill impairment charge (recorded in the second quarter of 2010 and the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes) and the impact of foreign losses on the annual effective tax rate. The rate was further impacted by the Company's recognition during the quarter of $7.1 million of benefit related to the recognition of tax credits and a release of a valuation allowance and a benefit of $3.8 million related to the finalization of our 2009 tax return.
Cash Flow
Q3 2010 cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow were $165.0 million and $130.8 million, respectively. Cash provided by continuing operations declined while Free Cash Flow grew compared to Q3 2009, as the decline in Adjusted OIBDA and declines in accrued liabilities were essentially offset by changes in deferred income taxes and cash payments in 2009 for employee bonus costs.
Acquisitions of 5 Minutes Ltd. ("5min Media"), TechCrunch, Inc. ("TechCrunch") and Thing Labs, Inc. ("Thing Labs")
In late September 2010, we completed the acquisitions of 5Min Media, Thing Labs and TechCrunch for $97.1 million in the aggregate, net of cash acquired. In addition, we have agreed to pay an aggregate of $23.1 million in total to certain employees of the acquired companies over the next three years contingent on their future service to AOL.
Subsequent Event
On October 29, 2010, AOL signed an agreement to sell a portion of its campus in Dulles, Virginia referred to as "Pacific Corporate Park" for $144.5 million in cash. The deal is expected to close on or about November 15, 2010. As a result of the expected sale, the carrying value of the assets associated with Pacific Corporate Park is presented as "Assets held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2010. In accordance with accounting guidance for property, plant and equipment, assets held for sale are reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as of the time the assets meet the held for sale criteria. The Company determined the carrying value of Pacific Corporate Park exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. As a result, an impairment charge of $6.2 million was recorded to costs of revenues during the third quarter of 2010.

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
 
Basis of Presentation
The financial information for all prior periods presented has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010. This recast reflects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of buy.at and ICQ as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). Media Metrix estimates unique visitors based on a sample of internet users in various countries (referred to as the "panel-only methodology"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Media Metrix announced the availability of an alternate methodology (currently referred to as "panel-centric unified" or "Media Metrix 360") to estimate unique visitors, in order to provide a more accurate count of a website's audience, and has continued to refine this methodology. We adopted this alternate methodology for domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media starting December 2009 and going forward. As a result, our domestic unique visitor numbers based on Media Metrix 360 will not be comparable to the estimates under the previous methodology. For comparison purposes, domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported, in Operating Metrics within this press release, under both the Media Metrix 360 and panel-only methodology for the third quarter of 2010.
 
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2010 (the "Quarterly Report") and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Quarterly Report and the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 3) the success of any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 4) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 5) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 6) asset impairments; 7) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 8) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 9) the impact of terrorist acts and hostilities.

(e) 2011 AOL Inc. Annual Bonus Plan
On January 26, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AOL Inc. (the "Company") approved the material terms of the 2011 AOL Inc. Annual Bonus Plan (the "ABP"). The ABP is a cash-based incentive plan in which eligible employees, including our Named Executive Officers, may participate. Employees eligible to participate in any of our other incentive plans, such as a sales or commission plan, are not eligible to participate in the ABP. For our Named Executive Officers, target incentive payments under the ABP will be based 75% on Company performanceadjusted operating income before depreciation ("Adjusted OIBDA") and cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and product development costs ("Free Cash Flow")and 25% on individual performance. For the Company performance component, 70% will be based on Adjusted OIBDA and the remaining 30% will be based on Free Cash Flow. For employees other than our Named Executive Officers, the ABP sets forth the performance components that we will use to determine each employee's target incentive payment. At the beginning of each plan year, upon the recommendation of management, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") approves the annual individual performance metrics for our Named Executive Officers. The individual performance component is based on the employee's overall performance rating in his or her annual review. Based on their performance rating, certain employees will be eligible to receive an additional discretionary amount. The annual target incentive under the ABP for each employee is reflected as a percentage of base salary unless the annual target incentive is governed by an employment agreement. Bonuses will be paid by no later than March 15, 2012. Participants must be employed by the Company at the time of payout to be eligible to receive a bonus. In the event of an employee's death, the employee's beneficiaries will receive a pro rata incentive payment based on the number of days the employee spent in an ABP-eligible position during the applicable plan year.
Award to Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
On January 25, 2011, the Compensation Committee, in connection with its annual compensation review, approved the grant of a cash bonus award to the Company's Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, Arthur Minson. The cash bonus award is in the aggregate amount of $2,253,125 of which $1,753,125 is pursuant to the 2010 AOL Inc. Annual Bonus Plan and $500,000 is pursuant to a discretionary bonus pool under which the Company's Chief Executive Officer, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, made cash bonus awards in recognition of exceptional performance to members of Company management having a title of Executive Vice President or higher. In approving the grant of the discretionary cash bonus award to Mr. Minson, the Compensation Committee recognized Mr. Minson's leadership and superior performance on major corporate initiatives and transactions in 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released fourth quarter 2010 results today.
NEW YORK  February 2, 2011
"I am very proud of what we accomplished in 2010 as we began the year with a significant restructuring of AOL and ended the year with a significantly improved balance sheet, a number of exciting new products and a new culture focused on winning," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "We have set aggressive goals for ourselves in 2011 in pursuit of capturing the growing opportunity ahead of us."
 
 
Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Advertising revenue declined $137.0 million versus Q4 2009 of which $80.2 million related to AOL-implemented initiatives and comprises: $53.0 million in lower Third Party Network revenue associated with European shutdowns and de-emphasis of low margin search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products; $13.4 million in lower international display revenue related to reduced operations in Germany and France and the absence of revenue from Bebo and ICQ which we sold earlier in 2010; and $13.8 million in lower search and contextual revenue from our de-emphasis of contextual products, fewer queries in Germany and France where we have reduced operations and the absence of revenue from ICQ.
Apart from the impacts of AOL-implemented initiatives, advertising revenue further reflects declines in search and contextual, display and Third Party Network revenue. Search and contextual revenue declines of $35.2 million include $25.0 million related to fewer domestic queries, due to a 23% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and lower traffic on AOL Properties, as well as a $10.2 million impact from fewer international queries. Display revenue declines of $11.9 million reflect a slight decline in domestic premium inventory sales as well as less AOL Properties inventory monetized through our network, resulting primarily from our efforts to improve the consumer experience. Premium inventory sales declines reflect the fact that the Company began the quarter with a significantly smaller pipeline, due to the impact on sales of the salesforce reorganization in Q1 2010, which was largely offset by incremental revenue generated during the quarter. Q4 2010 domestic display revenue includes approximately $2 million in revenue related to acquisitions made in Q3 2010. Third Party Network revenue declined $9.7 million primarily reflecting increased competition at Ad.com, partially offset by approximately $2 million in revenue related to acquisitions made in Q3 2010.
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the 23% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers noted above, partially offset by an increase of $5.4 million related to a favorable resolution of a legal dispute over revenue related to certain customers. Monthly average churn for the period was 2.3%, as compared to 3.0% in the prior year period, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to 9.5 years this period from 8.8 years in the prior year period. Average revenue per user declined 2.2% year-over-year.
Other revenue declines reflect lower mobile carrier and licensing revenues, partially offset by increases in third party web hosting revenues and transition services revenue associated with recent dispositions.
 
Profitability
Adjusted OIBDA increased reflecting reduced costs of revenues, restructuring costs and selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by the revenue declines discussed above. The reduced operating costs included Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), personnel-related expenses and network-related costs. TAC declined $91.1 million year-over-year reflecting lower partner revenue share in Europe associated with the cessation of operations in certain countries and reduced operations in France and Germany, as well as the de-emphasis of low margin advertising products. The decline in TAC also reflects the Q1 2010 amendment of a large distribution agreement. Lower personnel-related expenses continue to reflect reduced headcount resulting from the restructuring initiatives we began in 2009, partially offset by increased hiring for Patch and other strategic areas. Operating income also reflects a $25.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q4 2010 versus the prior year period, primarily due to a higher percentage of in-service assets being fully depreciated and certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in periods prior to Q4 2010.
Tax
Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 13.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2010, as compared to an effective tax rate of 90.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2010 decreased from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the effect of the goodwill impairment charge (recorded in the second quarter of 2010 and the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes), partially offset by the impact of foreign valuation allowances on the annual effective tax rate. Additionally, the rate was decreased by the Company's recognition of $8.2 million of benefit related to the release of foreign reserves.
Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to an effective tax rate of 45.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the effect of the goodwill impairment charge (the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes), partially offset by the effect of the Bebo worthless stock deduction recorded in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Cash Flow
Q4 2010 cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow were $107.1 million and $70.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined compared to Q4 2009, as the increase in Adjusted OIBDA was more than offset by working capital changes due to the timing of operating cash payments and receipts.
Acquisitions of Pictela, About.me and goviral
In December 2010, we completed the acquisitions of Pictela and About.me for $31.4 million in the aggregate, net of cash acquired. In addition, we have agreed to pay an aggregate of $11.5 million to certain employees of the acquired companies over the next three years contingent on their future service to AOL. This $11.5 million of contingent consideration will be treated as compensation expense for accounting purposes.
On January 31, 2011, we completed the purchase of goviral A/S, a company incorporated and registered in Denmark, for $74.1 million, net of cash acquired, subject to working capital adjustments. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay $22.6 million to certain employees of goviral over the next two years contingent on their future service to the Company. This $22.6 million will be treated as compensation expense for accounting purposes. goviral distributes branded online video for media agencies, creative agencies and content producers.
ICQ
On July 8, 2010, we completed the sale of our ICQ operations ("ICQ") for $187.5 million in cash (subject to working capital adjustments) to Digital Sky Technologies Limited, now known as Mail.ru Group Limited ("Mail.ru"). We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $119.6 million within discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2010. As part of the sale transaction, we agreed to provide certain network infrastructure services to Mail.ru for a limited period of time.
After our disposition of ICQ, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS'') contacted Mail.ru and, subsequently, Mail.ru and AOL submitted a joint voluntary filing to CFIUS commencing a review of the transaction under Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. AOL and Mail.ru are currently working with CFIUS to address their concerns. As a result of this process, it is probable that we will agree to provide certain network infrastructure and other operational services to Mail.ru at a level and for a period in excess of our contractual obligations under the original transaction agreements as well as other modifications to the parties' respective obligations under the transaction agreements.
As of the date of this earnings release, our estimate of the range of loss to be incurred as a result of these developments is $13.6 million to $28.1 million, the aggregate cap under the original transaction agreements for losses in connection with providing the network infrastructure services. Given that no amount within the range of loss appears to be a better estimate as of the date of this release, in our fourth quarter and full year 2010 consolidated statement of operations we have accrued a loss of $13.6 million, the low end of the range of estimated loss, and reflected such loss as a reduction to the previously recorded $119.6 million gain. The CFIUS process is ongoing and if there are any significant
 
developments between now and the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a change in our estimated range of loss, we will update our disclosure and results of operations for the year and three months ended December 31, 2010, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect such developments.
Given the probable extension and modification of the services we are providing to ICQ, we have concluded that the ICQ operations, for the period prior to the sale, no longer meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. As a result, we have recast the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the ICQ operations through the date of sale within continuing operations for all periods presented. The financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ICQ continue to be excluded from AOL's financial results for all periods subsequent to July 8, 2010.

The following table represents certain items that impacted the comparability of net income attributable to AOL Inc. for the three months and years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (In millions, except per share amounts):
Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Basis of Presentation
The financial information for all prior periods presented has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the financial information for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010. This recast reflects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of buy.at as discontinued operations and the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of ICQ as continuing operations for all periods presented. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of ICQ continue to be excluded from AOL's financial results for all periods subsequent to July 8, 2010.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). Media Metrix estimates unique visitors based on a sample of internet users in various countries (referred to as the "panel-only methodology"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Media Metrix announced the availability of an alternate methodology (currently referred to as "panel-centric unified" or "Media Metrix 360") to estimate unique visitors, in order to provide a more accurate count of a website's audience, and has continued to refine this methodology. We adopted this alternate methodology for domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media starting December 2009 and going forward. As a result, our domestic unique visitor numbers based on Media Metrix 360 will not be comparable to the estimates under the previous methodology. For comparison purposes, domestic unique visitors to AOL Properties and AOL Media are reported, in Operating Metrics within this press release, under both the Media Metrix 360 and panel-only methodology for the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2010 (the "Quarterly Report") and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Quarterly Report and the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 3) the success of any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 4) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 5) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 6) asset impairments; 7) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 8) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 9) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

The information that we disclose regarding unique visitors is based on data provided by a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). AOL unique visitors represent the estimated number of individuals who visited any content of a Website or application owned by AOL or for which the traffic has been assigned to AOL by the owner during the applicable measurement period.
Media Metrix has historically estimated unique visitors based on a sample of Internet users in various countries (referred to as the "panel-only methodology"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
 
 
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures, capitalized product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations. We have computed Free Cash Flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

On February 7, 2011, AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AOL"), announced that it and Headline Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AOL ("Merger Sub"), and TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("The Huffington Post"), had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated as of February 6, 2011. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, AOL will acquire The Huffington Post by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into The Huffington Post, with The Huffington Post becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of AOL (the "Merger").
Consideration
AOL will acquire The Huffington Post for estimated aggregate consideration of approximately $315 million, subject to adjustment for changes in working capital and reduction for indebtedness and transaction expenses of The Huffington Post that remain unpaid as of closing. Approximately $15 million of the aggregate consideration relates to the fair value of unvested The Huffington Post stock options held by The Huffington Post employees that will be converted into unvested AOL stock options, reducing the cash portion of the aggregate consideration to approximately $300 million. In connection therewith, AOL will assume The Huffington Post stock option plan. AOL estimates that approximately $10 million of the $15 million in fair value of these converted stock options will be expensed over the future service period of these employees and the remaining amount will be treated as purchase consideration. Additionally, AOL currently expects cash restructuring charges of approximately $30 million in the aggregate in connection with this transaction, of which $10 million represents cash consideration that will be reflected as a restructuring charge immediately following the acquisition, as this amount is associated with stock options that will vest upon the termination of certain employees. The cash portion of the aggregate consideration will be allocated among holders of The Huffington Post preferred stock, The Huffington Post common stock and vested The Huffington Post stock options and warrants to purchase The Huffington Post stock.
Representations, Warranties and Indemnities
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and indemnification rights of AOL. A portion of the purchase price will be deposited into escrow to secure The Huffington Post stockholders' indemnification obligations in respect of any breach by The Huffington Post of its representations and warranties and certain other matters.
Approvals
The boards of directors of AOL and The Huffington Post have approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. In addition, following execution of the Merger Agreement, AOL and certain stockholders of The Huffington Post entered into a Consent Agreement, pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other things, to deliver a written consent in favor of the transaction. Upon delivery of such written consent, which occurred shortly following execution of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement was approved by the stockholders of The
 
Huffington Post. No further board or shareholder approvals are required to approve the Merger or the Merger Agreement.
Closing Conditions
The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, no material adverse effect with respect to The Huffington Post having occurred and the execution of employment arrangements by certain employees of The Huffington Post. The Merger is expected to close in the late first- or early second-quarter of 2011.
AOL will file a copy of the Merger Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement for a more complete understanding of the transaction. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
New York, NY  February 7, 2011  AOL Inc. [NYSE:AOL] announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Huffington Post, the influential and rapidly growing news, analysis, and lifestyle website founded in 2005, which now counts nearly 25 million unique monthly visitors*.
The transaction will create a premier global, national, local, and hyper-local content group for the digital age  leveraged across online, mobile, tablet, and video platforms. The combination of AOL's infrastructure and scale with The Huffington Post's pioneering approach to news and innovative community building among a broad and sophisticated audience will mark a seminal moment in the evolution of digital journalism and online engagement.
The new group will have a combined base of 117 million unique visitors a month in the United States and 270 million around the world**. Following the close of this transaction, AOL will accelerate its strategy to deliver a scaled and differentiated array of premium news, analysis, and entertainment produced by thousands of writers, editors, reporters, and videographers around the globe.
As part of the transaction, Arianna Huffington, The Huffington Post's Co-founder and Editor-in-Chief, will be named President and Editor-in-Chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, which will integrate all Huffington Post and AOL content, including Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater, AOL Music, AOL Latino, AutoBlog, Patch, StyleList, and more.
"The acquisition of The Huffington Post will create a next-generation American media company with global reach that combines content, community, and social experiences for consumers," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO of AOL. "Together, our companies will embrace the digital future and become a digital destination that delivers unmatched experiences for both consumers and advertisers."
Armstrong continued, "Arianna is a singularly passionate and dedicated champion of innovative journalistic engagement, and a master of the art of using new media to illuminate, entertain and enhance the national conversation. Arianna is a remarkable person and she will continue to create remarkable outcomes for the combined company."
 
"This is truly a merger of visions and a perfect fit for us," said Huffington. "The Huffington Post will continue on the same path we have been on for the last six years  though now at light speed  by combining with AOL. Our readers will still be able to come to the Huffington Post at the same URL, and find all the same content they've grown to love, plus a lot more  more local, more tech, more entertainment, more finance, and lots more video. We are fusing a legendary and powerful new media brand with a vibrant, innovative news organization, known for its distinctive voice, a highly engaged audience, an expertise in community-building, and a track record for demystifying the news and putting flesh and blood on the data while drawing our audience into the conversation."
Huffington continued, "By uniting AOL and The Huffington Post, we are creating one of the largest destinations for smart content and community on the Internet. And we intend to keep making it better and better."
Kenneth Lerer, The Huffington Post's Co-Founder and Chairman, said, "The Huffington Post team has created a potent brand with the proven track record of knowing how to grow traffic, inform and entertain its readers and build a one-of-a-kind online community. Add that to the powerful scale and resources of AOL and you have the perfect combination for today and the future. Together these two companies will be a premier online content provider. From local citizen reporting through AOL's Patch, to The Huffington Post's national reporting on politics, business and culture, consumers will have access to everything they want whenever they want it."
AOL has agreed to purchase The Huffington Post for $315 million, approximately $300 million of which will be paid in cash funded from cash on hand. The Huffington Post is privately owned by its two cofounders, as well as a group of investors. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of government approvals. The boards of directors of each company and shareholders of The Huffington Post have approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the late first- or early second-quarter 2011.
The Huffington Post over-indexes on educated, affluent users, reaching the key decision makers in C-suites around the globe. The Huffington Post speaks to this influential audience via a host of prominent voices on its group blog. Among those who have blogged on The Huffington Post are: President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Larry Page, Diane Sawyer, Buzz Aldrin, Nora Ephron, Bill Maher, Madeleine Albright, Robert Redford, Katie Couric, Neil Young, Rahm Emanuel, Mia Farrow, Senator Russ Feingold, Senator Al Franken, Ari Emanuel, Harry Shearer, Senator John Kerry, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Madonna, Lawrence Summers, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ryan Reynolds, Craig Newmark, Alec Baldwin, Aaron Sorkin, Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Russell Simmons, Sean Penn, Bill Gates, Norman Lear, Charlie Rose, Elizabeth Warren, Tavis Smiley, Sheryl Sandberg, George Clooney, and former President Bill Clinton. And the audience speaks back, generating four million comments a month***.
The Huffington Post's affluent, influential audience, that is growing at a rate of 22 percent (December 2009 vs. December 2010)****, when combined with AOL's massive scale, video offerings and local expertise, will represent an incredibly desirable demographic for a broad range of advertising partners across the board.

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released first quarter 2011 results today.
NEW YORK  May 4, 2011
"Today represents an important milestone in the turnaround of AOL as global display revenue grew for the first time since Q4 2007," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "I am proud of the work completed thus far and we remain focused on accelerating our momentum through continued execution of our strategy to become the premier digital content company."
 
 
Q1 Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Advertising revenue declined $40.6 million versus Q1 2010. Initiatives implemented by AOL in 2010 negatively impacted advertising revenue by $41.8 million and comprised: $25.9 million in lower Third Party Network revenue associated with European shutdowns and the de-emphasis of low margin search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products; $8.2 million in lower international display revenue related to reduced operations in Germany and France and the absence of revenue from Bebo and ICQ which we sold in 2010; and $7.7 million in lower search and contextual revenue reflecting the absence of revenue from ICQ, our de-emphasis of contextual products and fewer queries in Germany and France where we have reduced operations.
Apart from the impacts of AOL-implemented initiatives, advertising revenue was essentially flat, reflecting declines in search and contextual revenue, partially offset by growth in display revenue and increases in Third Party Network revenue. Search and contextual revenue declines of $17.3 million include $12.3 million related to fewer domestic queries, due to lower search traffic on AOL Properties and a 22% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers, as well as a $7.1 million impact from fewer international queries. Domestic display revenue grew $7.0 million reflecting improved pricing and a higher sell through rate, particularly in Telecom, Personal Finance and Auto categories. Q1 2011 domestic display revenue includes approximately $5.2 million in revenue primarily related to the acquisitions of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. ("The Huffington Post") and TechCrunch, Inc. Third Party Network revenue increased $5.3 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of 5 Minutes Ltd. ("5min Media") and goviral A/S ("goviral").
Subscription revenue declines primarily reflect the 22% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers noted above and a 2% decline in average revenue per subscriber. Monthly average churn for the period was 2.5%, as compared to 3.0% in the prior year period, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to 10.3 years this period from 9.1 years in the prior year period.
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues.
 
Profitability
Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA declines reflect the lower revenue discussed above and increased costs of revenues due primarily to increased investment in Patch, $9 million in deal related expenses primarily associated with the acquisitions of goviral and The Huffington Post and $8.4 million of incentive compensation expense associated with acquisitions made in 2010 and Q1 2011. Cost of revenue increases were partially offset by a $17.8 million decline in traffic acquisition costs reflecting lower partner revenue share in Europe associated with the cessation of operations or reduced operations in certain countries. Operating income also reflects a $47.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q1 2011 versus Q1 2010, primarily due to a re-evaluation of the useful lives of certain intangible assets, which resulted in incremental amortization expense of $32.9 million in Q1 2010.
Tax
The Company had a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $11.2 million and a related income tax benefit of $15.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 142.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2011, as compared to an effective tax rate of 47.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to $7.1 million of income tax benefit associated with an anticipated worthless stock deduction in connection with the sale of a subsidiary during the quarter and $8.2 million in favorable adjustments related to escrow disbursements from prior acquisitions for which we have now concluded we will be able to recognize a tax benefit.
Cash Flow
Q1 2011 cash used by continuing operations was $9.3 million while Free Cash Flow was a $41.5 million outflow. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined versus Q1 2010, primarily reflecting the decline in operating income and timing of operating cash payments and receipts. The most significant items impacting the latter were full year employee bonus payments in Q1 2011 versus the prior year when half of 2009's employee bonus plan was paid out in 2009 and the other half was paid out in Q1 2010, partially offset by less restructuring costs paid out in Q1 2011 than Q1 2010.
Acquisitions of goviral and The Huffington Post
On January 31, 2011, AOL completed the purchase of goviral for $69.1 million, net of cash acquired. The Company also agreed to pay up to $22.6 million to certain employees over the next two years contingent on their future service to AOL. This $22.6 million will be treated as compensation expense for accounting purposes.
On March 4, 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for $295.9 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, AOL incurred $8.7 million of restructuring charges associated with stock options that vested on or shortly after the closing date as a result of the termination of certain employees of The Huffington Post. As part of the acquisition, unvested options held by employees of The Huffington Post were converted into unvested AOL options. $3.9 million of the fair value of The Huffington Post options that were converted was included in the purchase price, $8.1 million of the fair value of such awards is expected to be recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the remaining award vesting periods, which for most employees is 24 months, and the remaining $0.4 million of the fair value of such awards was recorded as a restructuring charge.
 
ICQ
During the first quarter of 2011, we reached final agreement with Mail.ru and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") regarding our ongoing transition obligations in connection with the disposition of our ICQ operations. As part of this agreement, we agreed to provide certain network infrastructure and other operational services to the buyer at a level and for a period in excess of our contractual obligations under the original transaction agreements as well as other modifications to the parties' respective obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, we reassessed the estimated liability incurred in connection with the ongoing obligations, and recorded a nominal reduction to the gain on the sale in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, we recorded $1.6 million as a reduction to the gain on sale during the three months ended March 31, 2011 related to professional fees incurred as a result of the negotiations with Mail.ru and CFIUS. We do not expect that our ongoing transition obligations will have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. During the first quarter of 2011, we modified our definition of Adjusted OIBDA to exclude the impacts of restructuring costs, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and equity-based compensation, which will allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
We acquired The Huffington Post on March 4, 2011. Following the acquisition of The Huffington Post, AOL aligned all of its content under the newly formed HPMG, which is a subset of AOL Properties and excludes Mail, Instant Messaging and Ventures. As a result of this realignment and to reflect how management views the business, we are disclosing domestic average monthly unique visitors to HPMG for all periods presented and will no longer disclose domestic average monthly unique visitors to AOL Media. The primary differences between HPMG and AOL Media are that HPMG includes The Huffington Post, AOL Search and Local.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Quarterly Report and the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 3) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 4) the success of any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 5) market adoption of new products and services; 6) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 7) asset impairments; 8) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 9) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 10) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

Distributions from Accounts
(a) Vested Restricted Stock Units. At the time of any distribution, (i) each Vested Restricted Stock Unit under the Participant's Account shall be converted into one share of the Company's Common Stock and such share shall be distributed to the Participant.

The Company shall not be required to fund or otherwise segregate assets to be used for payment of benefits under the Plan.

The amounts payable to any Directors under the Plan shall not be affected by any such investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its discretion, may maintain one or more trusts to hold assets to be used for payment of benefits under the Plan; provided that the assets of such trust shall be subject to the creditors of the Company in the event that the Company becomes insolvent or is subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Any payments by such a trust of benefits provided hereunder shall be considered payment by the Company and shall discharge the Company of any further liability for the payments made by such trust.
Section 10.01
Funding

Section 10.02
Retention Rights

Section 10.03
Authorized Payments
. Although the Company makes no guarantee with respect to the tax treatment of payments and benefits hereunder, the Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A and shall be limited, construed, administered, and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Accordingly, and notwithstanding Article IX, the Company reserves the right to amend the provisions of the Plan at any time in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax under Section 409A on any payments to be made hereunder. In no event whatsoever shall the Company or any of its affiliates be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on a Participant by Section 409A or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A, other than for withholding or other obligations applicable to employers, if any, under Section 409A.
Section 10.04

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released second quarter 2011 results today.
NEW YORK  August 9, 2011
"AOL's return to global advertising growth for the first time since 2008 reflects the hard work of our team and another meaningful step forward in the comeback of the AOL brand," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "AOL is singularly focused on becoming the next great media company for the digital age and we have positioned the Company's best people, technology and assets in front of some of the largest opportunities on the internet."
 
 
Q2 Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
Revenue Summary
 
Global advertising revenue grew year-over-year in Q2 2011, reflecting double digit growth in both third party network and display revenue and marking the first quarter of global advertising growth since Q2 2008.
Global advertising revenue grew $14.3 million versus Q2 2010 despite being negatively impacted by $11.8 million related to the following: $5.9 million in lower search and contextual revenue primarily reflecting the sale of ICQ in July 2010; $3.0 million in lower third party network revenue associated with European shutdowns and the de-emphasis of low margin search engine campaign management and lead generation affiliate products; $1.6 million in lower international display revenue reflecting the sale in 2010 of Bebo and ICQ; and $1.3 million in lower domestic display revenue reflecting the sale in 2010 of Digital Marketing Services.
Excluding the impacts of the items discussed above, AOL's global advertising revenue growth was driven by increases in third party network and display revenue. Third party network revenue increased $24.2 million, primarily reflecting 15% growth in Ad.com and $10.9 million related to the acquisitions of 5 Minutes Ltd. and goviral A/S. Display growth was driven by an 18% increase in domestic display revenue reflecting improved pricing on premium display advertising, a portion of which is attributable to our acquisitions of The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. The increase in display revenue also reflects improved yield management, performance-based fees related to marketing of third party products and services and an increase in Patch revenues. Partially offsetting advertising revenue growth was a decline in search and contextual revenue of $17.6 million which includes $13.3 million primarily related to fewer domestic queries and a 21% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers, as well as a $4.3 million impact from fewer international queries.
Subscription revenue declines reflect the 21% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers noted above and a 3% decline in average revenue per subscriber. Monthly average churn for the period was 2.2%, as compared to 2.6% in the prior year period, and the average paid tenure of our domestic AOL-brand access subscribers has increased to approximately 10 years this period from approximately 9 years in the prior year period.
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues.
 
Profitability
AOL's change in net loss, excluding the impact of the Q2 2010 goodwill impairment charge and Adjusted OIBDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above and increased costs of revenues. Costs of revenues reflect increased personnel costs due primarily to increased investment in Patch and other areas of strategic focus including acquisitions made in 2010 and particularly in Q1 2011. Increased costs of revenue also reflect $10.2 million of increased incentive compensation expense associated with the aforementioned acquisitions and $9.5 million of increased traffic acquisition costs (TAC) reflecting increased third party advertising revenue. Operating income also reflects an $18.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q2 2011 versus Q2 2010 primarily due to a decline in depreciable assets and a re-evaluation of the useful lives of certain intangible assets, which resulted in incremental amortization expense of $7.1 million in Q2 2010.
Tax
The Company had a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $7.5 million. However, due to the impact of foreign losses, for which no benefit is received, and changes to state tax and apportionment rates, we recorded income tax expense of $4.3 million. Due to the size of these items in Q2 2011 relative to the Company's pre-tax loss, the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2011 differs significantly from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and from the Company's effective tax rate of 20.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2010.
Cash Flow
Q2 2011 cash from continuing operations was $104.8 million while Free Cash Flow was $77.2 million. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined versus Q2 2010, primarily reflecting the increase in operating loss, excluding the impact of the Q2 2010 goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower TAC, restructuring and retention bonus payments in Q2 2011 as compared to Q2 2010.

The following table represents certain items that impacted the comparability of net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (In millions, except per share amounts):
Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. During the first quarter of 2011, we modified our definition of Adjusted OIBDA to exclude the impacts of restructuring costs, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and equity-based compensation, which will allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Following the acquisition of The Huffington Post on March 4, 2011, AOL aligned all of its content under the newly formed AOL Huffington Post Media Group (HPMG), which is a subset of AOL Properties and excludes Mail, Instant Messaging and AOL Ventures. Unique visitors to The Huffington Post are included subsequent to the acquisition date.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Further, lower than expected market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 3) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 4) any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 5) market adoption of new products and services; 6) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 7) asset impairments; 8) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 9) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 10) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

Exhibit 99.1
 AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released third quarter 2011 results today. "AOL grew global advertising by 8%, driven by 28% and 15% growth in third party network and global display advertising revenue, respectively, substantially closing the gap to revenue and eventual profit growth," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "We continue to build strong consumer experiences as we execute our strategy to build the premium branded media company for the internet. Our share repurchases underlie our belief in the value of AOL and our strategy."
NEW YORK  November 2, 2011
 
 
Q3 Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Global advertising revenue grew year-over-year in Q3 2011, reflecting double digit growth in both third party network and display revenue, partially offset by declines in search and contextual revenue.
Third party network revenue increased $21.2 million, reflecting 12% growth in Ad.com and $12.1 million related to the acquisitions of 5 Minutes Ltd. and goviral A/S. Third party network revenue growth was partially offset by a decline of $0.7 million related to European shutdowns and the de-emphasis of certain low margin products in 2010.
Global display revenue was driven by a 14% increase in domestic display revenue reflecting improved pricing on premium display advertising and an increase in sellable premium inventory following our acquisitions of The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. The increase in display revenue also reflects improved yield management, an increase in Patch revenue and performance-based fees related to marketing of third party products and services. International display revenue reflects growth in both the Canada and UK. Global display revenue growth was partially offset by a decline of $0.9 million related to the sale of ICQ in July 2010 as well as declines related to reduced operations in Germany and France.
Partially offsetting advertising revenue growth was a decline in search and contextual revenue of $14.6 million which includes $11.8 million primarily related to fewer domestic queries, the majority of which relates to a 15% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers. Search and contextual revenue declines also reflects the $2.0 million impact from fewer international queries. The decline in search and contextual advertising revenue was slightly offset by growth in search revenue on AOL.com.
Subscription revenue declines reflect a 15% and 3% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and average revenue per subscriber, respectively. During the quarter, AOL began a price rationalization program and migrated certain individuals who did not previously receive access service (and therefore were not included as domestic AOL-brand access subscribers) to a higher priced plan with additional services that included access
 
Revenue continued 
 
service. As a result, domestic AOL-brand access subscribers increased by approximately 200,000, leading to a lower year-over-year rate of decline than we have seen in recent quarters. Additionally, monthly average churn fell from 2.6% in Q3 2010 to 2.2% in Q3 2011 and also contributed to the lower rate of decline. The decline in churn primarily reflects a maturing domestic AOL-brand access subscriber base with the average paid tenure approximately 10.6 years in Q3 2011 versus approximately 9.4 years in Q3 2010. The migration of customers to a plan that includes access service (which is at a lower price relative to most of our other price plans) also led to a slightly higher rate of decline in average revenue per subscriber than we have seen in recent quarters.
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues.
Profitability
AOL generated a net loss of $2.6 million compared to net income of $171.6 million in the year ago period. This change reflects a gain on the sale of ICQ in the year-ago period, the lower revenue discussed above, increased costs of revenues and a $7.1 million restructuring charge in Q3 2011, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. While declining sequentially, costs of revenues grew year-over-year reflecting continued investment in Patch and other areas of strategic focus including acquisitions made late in 2010 and early in 2011. Increased costs of revenue also reflect $9.3 million of increased retention compensation expense associated with acquisitions and $11.3 million of increased traffic acquisition costs (TAC) reflecting increased third party advertising revenue. General and administrative expenses declined year-over-year and sequentially, benefitting from a reduction in personnel and facilities costs mainly related to reduced corporate headcount, due to the impact of strategic initiatives in 2010 to align costs with our structure. The change in net loss also reflects an $8.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q3 2011 versus Q3 2010 primarily due to a decline in depreciable assets.
Tax
AOL had pre-tax income from continuing operations of $7.1 million. However, due to the impact of foreign losses, for which no tax benefit is received on our U.S. income tax provision, we recorded income tax expense of $9.7 million. Due to the size of foreign losses in Q3 2011 relative to AOL's pre-tax income, the Company's effective tax rate of 136.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2011 differs significantly from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and from AOL's effective tax rate of 19.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2010. AOL is not currently a cash tax payer.
Cash Flow
Q3 2011 cash from continuing operations was $81.1 million while Free Cash Flow was $56.4 million. Cash provided by continuing operations and Free Cash Flow declined versus Q3 2010, primarily reflecting the decrease in operating income (excluding the gain on the sale of our ICQ operations in 2010), partially offset by lower restructuring payments in Q3 2011 as compared to Q3 2010.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments. During the first quarter of 2011, we modified our definition of Adjusted OIBDA to exclude the impacts of restructuring costs, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and equity-based compensation, which will allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Following the acquisition of The Huffington Post on March 4, 2011, AOL aligned all of its content under the newly formed AOL Huffington Post Media Group (HPMG), which is a subset of AOL Properties and excludes Mail, Instant Messaging and AOL Ventures. Unique visitors to The Huffington Post are included subsequent to the acquisition date.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues may result in our inability to realize the value of recorded intangibles and goodwill. In addition, achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 3) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 4) any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 5) market adoption of new products and services; 6) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 7) asset impairments; 8) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 9) our inability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 10) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

The information that we disclose regarding unique visitors is based on data provided by a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). AOL unique visitors represent the estimated number of individuals who visited any content of a Website or application owned by AOL or for which the traffic has been assigned to AOL by the owner during the applicable measurement period.
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures, capitalized product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes the identified non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations. We have computed Free Cash Flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

Exhibit 99.1
 
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released fourth quarter 2011 results today.
NEW YORK  February 1, 2012
"AOL took a large step forward in Q4 and I am very pleased with the way we ended the year," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "Our Q4 results highlight AOL's ability to methodically improve our consumer offering and financial performance. We continue to invest in AOL and will continue to improve our operations during 2012."
 
 
Q4 Noteworthy Items:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Global advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year in Q4 2011, reflecting double digit growth in both global display and the third party network, partially offset by declines in search and contextual revenue.
Global display revenue was driven by growth in domestic and international display advertising. Domestic display advertising revenue growth reflects continued improved pricing on premium display advertising and improved yield management across our properties. Growth in display revenue also reflects an increase in Patch revenue and performance-based fees related to marketing of third party products and services. International display revenue reflects growth in both the U.K. and Canada.
Third party network revenue increased $17.8 million, reflecting 10% growth in the Advertising.com Group and $9.4 million related to the acquisition of goviral (acquired in January 2011). Advertising.com Group growth reflects an increase in advertisers and publishers on the network and increased sales of premium packages and products.
Partially offsetting advertising revenue growth was a decline in search and contextual revenue of $8.0 million, primarily related to fewer domestic queries, due in large part to a decline in queries from legacy cobranded portals and a 15% year-over-year decrease in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers. Search and contextual revenue declines also reflects the $2.3 million impact from fewer international queries, partially offset by growth in search revenue on AOL.com. Notably, search and contextual revenue grew sequentially for the first quarter in 3 years, driven by sequential growth on AOL.com.
Subscription revenue declines reflect a 15% and 1% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and average revenue per subscriber, respectively. Subscription revenue declines also reflect the net effect of resolutions of certain disputes with the counterparty to whom we sold our German access business in 2007. The resolution of these disputes favorably impacted Q4 2010 and Q4 2011 subscription revenue by $5.4 million and $3.1 million (-$2.3 million net impact on year-over-year growth), respectively. Q4's subscription revenue decline was the lowest level of decline in 5 years. In addition to benefitting from the continued maturation of the tenured base, the decrease in the rate of decline in subscription revenue reflects the impact of a price rationalization program AOL began in late Q3. This program significantly reduced the number of price points and more clearly defined and enhanced the value of our product offerings for consumers. Additionally, monthly average churn contributed to the lower rate of decline, falling from 2.3% in Q4 2010 to 2.2% in Q4 2011.
 
Revenue continued 
 
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues. Revenue from mobile carriers represented 38% of total "Other revenue" in Q4 2010 and 17% in Q4 2011.
Profitability
AOL's decline in operating income and Adjusted OIBDA primarily reflects the lower revenue discussed above and increased costs of revenues, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. While declining sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, costs of revenues grew year-over-year reflecting continued investment in areas of strategic focus, primarily related to acquisitions made late in 2010 and early in 2011 and $4.8 million of increased TAC, reflecting increased third party advertising revenue. General and administrative expenses declined year-over-year, benefitting from a reduction in personnel and facilities costs mainly related to reduced corporate headcount as a result of the impact of strategic initiatives in 2010 to align costs with our structure. Q4 2011 operating income and Adjusted OIBDA were also negatively impacted by an $8.5 million legal settlement. Operating income declines were partially offset by a $13.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in Q4 2011 versus Q4 2010 primarily due to a decline in depreciable assets and certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Net income declines were impacted by the Q4 2010 gain on sale of AOL's investment in Brightcove and an increased income tax provision.
Tax
Although our income tax provision increased in Q4 2011, we are utilizing and expect to continue to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future cash income tax obligations. Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 57.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to an effective tax rate of 13.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2010. This rate increased from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2010 due to the impact of foreign losses, for which no benefit is received on our U.S. income tax provision, and the impact of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) vesting in Q4 2011. The net decline in AOL's stock price since the grant date of these RSUs has resulted in a lower tax deduction than the book compensation expense previously recorded, which increases our income tax provision in the period the RSUs vest. Additionally, the effective rate for the three months ended December 31, 2011 increased over the effective rate for the prior year period, due to the goodwill impairment charge (recorded in Q2 2010, the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes). The significance of this primarily non-deductible charge relative to our operating income in 2010 had the effect of significantly lowering our Q4 2010 effective tax rate.
Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 69.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to an effective tax rate of 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective tax rate in 2011 increased from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rate for the year
 
Tax continued 
 
ended December 31, 2010 due to the impact of foreign losses, for which no benefit is received on our U.S. income tax provision, and non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2011, partially offset by the effects of the worthless stock deductions and favorable adjustments related to escrow disbursements in 2011 which will result in a tax benefit. Additionally, the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased over the effective rate for the prior year period due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2010, the majority of which was non-deductible for income tax purposes. The significance of this primarily non-deductible charge relative to our operating income in 2010 had the effect of significantly lowering our 2010 effective tax rate.
Cash Flow
Q4 2011 cash from continuing operations was $97.9 million while Free Cash Flow was $72.6 million. Cash provided by continuing operations declined versus Q4 2010, primarily reflecting the decrease in operating income, partially offset by lower restructuring payments in Q4 2011 as compared to Q4 2010. Free Cash Flow grew year-over-year reflecting a reduction in capital expenditures in the current year period.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 8) asset impairments; 9) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 10) our ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 11) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes the identified non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations. We have computed Free Cash Flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

 February 24, 2012  AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) issued the following statement in response to Starboard Value LP's Letter to the AOL Board
NEW YORK, NY
The recent improved earnings results of AOL Inc. ("AOL" or "the Company") highlight the significant progress we are making in executing our strategy to improve AOL's growth trajectory and create meaningful shareholder value. We ended 2011 with our best performance as a company in the past five years, with substantial growth in advertising revenue, improvements in legacy revenue streams, and significant cost reductions. Our stock price has acted in kind, appreciating approximately 80% from our 2011 low and 20% year-to-date.
AOL's Board of Directors and management team consistently review the strategy and performance of the Company and have taken meaningful actions to enhance shareholder return including the divestiture of non-core assets, significant cost reduction, a meaningful buyback of Company equity, and the implementation of an accountable and performance-based culture to operate against our clear strategy.
AOL has held several meetings with Starboard Value LP to address their questions. AOL communicated our continued intent to simplify AOL's business and our efforts to accelerate shareholder value creation. AOL has offered Starboard Value LP an opportunity to help shape the Company's Board of Directors composition and size. Unfortunately, Starboard Value LP has a singularly focused agenda and rejected this productive path to address their stated concerns and drive increased shareholder value.
Our Board of Directors and management team remain firmly committed to creating value for all shareholders. We have a valuable patent portfolio and several months ago, prior to Starboard's first letter, the AOL Board of Directors authorized the start of a process, and hired advisors, to realize the value of certain non-strategic patents. AOL has a clear plan to provide our consumers and customers with exceptional value, which we believe will lead to the creation of shareholder value. We will continue to aggressively execute and innovate on our strategy as we continue the turnaround of AOL.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On April 9, 2012, AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AOL" or the "Company"), announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell over 800 of the Company's patents and their related patent applications (the "Patent Portfolio") to Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Microsoft"), and to grant Microsoft a non-exclusive license to its retained patent portfolio, for aggregate proceeds of $1.056 billion in cash. The transaction is structured as a purchase of all of the outstanding shares of a wholly-owned non-operating subsidiary of the Company and the direct acquisition of those patents in the portfolio not held by the subsidiary.
At the closing of the transaction, the Company and Microsoft will enter into an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement which provides for (i) a non-exclusive license to the Company for the use of all of the transferred patents in the Patent Portfolio and (ii) mutual releases with respect to claims arising from patents held by the other party prior to the closing. Additionally, the Company will grant Microsoft a non-exclusive license under all the patents retained by the Company after the closing and Microsoft will grant the Company certain defensive termination rights related to those retained patents.
The parties have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including, among others, covenants not to take certain actions with respect to the Patent Portfolio and to transfer all assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, other than the patents that are part of the Patent Portfolio, to the Company. Both parties also agree to use reasonable best efforts to obtain third-party consents and approvals required to consummate the Purchase Agreement, including making Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filings within 15 business days of the date of the Agreement. The parties agree to cooperate and consult with each other in connection with obtaining all required regulatory approvals.
Consummation of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the expiration or termination of any applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, the absence of any injunction, statute, rule, regulation, order or decree that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the sale, and the representations and warranties of the other party, without giving effect to any materiality qualifications therein, shall be true and correct in all material respects (unless made as of a specific date), except in the case of the Company where such failures to be true and correct have not had a material adverse effect. No shareholder vote is required to consummate the transaction.
The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent, by either party if a non-appealable statute, rule, regulation, order or decree prevents the transaction, by either party if all of the closing conditions of the other party have been satisfied but the other party fails to consummate the sale within two business days, or by either party if the closing shall not have occurred within six months of signing, provided that such date may be extended by either party by 180 days. If Microsoft elects to utilize the 180 day extension, a per day fee will apply. Microsoft would be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $211,200,000 if the transaction is terminated pursuant to its terms for any of the above reasons other than by mutual written consent, if the Company's failure to perform a covenant is the cause of the termination or if the conditions to the agreement are met and the Company fails to close the transactions within two business days.
The above description of the Purchase Agreement and the Intellectual Property Matters Agreements have been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement. They are not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Microsoft, or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. Therefore, investors and security holders should not treat them as categorical statements of fact.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released first quarter 2012 results today.
NEW YORK  May 9, 2012
"AOL is a much stronger company today than a year ago and began 2012 by growing advertising revenue, lowering expenses and improving Adjusted OIBDA trends," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "In 2012 and beyond we are simultaneously focused on the continued successful execution of our strategy and on creating and unlocking value for our shareholders."
 
 
 
Revenue Trends:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Profitability Trends:
 
 
 
 
 
Product/Consumer Trends:
 
 
 
 
 
Asset, Cash & Cash Flow Trends:
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Global advertising revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q1 2012, reflecting double-digit growth in the third party network and growth in global display revenue, partially offset by declines in search and contextual revenue.
Global display revenue was driven by growth in international display advertising, partially offset by a slight decline in domestic display advertising revenue. International display revenue growth reflects continued growth in both the U.K. and Canada. Domestic display advertising revenue declined primarily reflecting a decline in reserved impressions sold, partially offset by growth in reserved inventory pricing and Patch revenue.
Third party network revenue increased $20.8 million, reflecting 14% growth in Advertising.com and $2.4 million related to one month of additional goviral revenue (acquired January 31, 2011). Advertising.com growth reflects an increase in advertisers and publishers on the network and increased sales of premium packages and products. Third party network revenue also reflects $6.4 million related to Ad.com Japan, a Japanese joint venture which AOL began consolidating during the quarter as a result of acquiring a controlling interest in the joint venture by increasing its ownership from 50% to 53% and gaining control of the board and day-to-day operations.
Search and contextual revenue trends continued to improve year-over-year and revenue grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Total search and contextual revenue declined $6.2 million year-over-year, primarily due to a 14% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and fewer queries from cobranded portals and international markets. Search and contextual revenue declines were partially offset by continued growth in search revenue on AOL.com.
Subscription revenue declines reflect a 14% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers. The decline in subscription revenue was the lowest level of decline in 5 years. In addition to benefitting from the continued maturation of the tenured base, the decrease in the rate of decline in subscription revenue reflects the impact of a price rationalization program AOL began in late Q3 2011. This program significantly reduced the number of price points and more clearly defined and enhanced the value of our product offerings for consumers. Additionally, monthly average churn contributed to the lower rate of decline, falling from 2.5% in Q1 2011 to 2.0% in Q1 2012.
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues. Revenue from mobile carriers represented 32% of total "Other revenue" in Q1 2011 and 11% in Q1 2012.
 
Profitability
AOL's Adjusted OIBDA decline was the lowest rate of decline in four years and primarily reflects the lower revenue discussed above, partially offset by lower cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses. Costs of revenues have declined sequentially for three consecutive quarters and during Q1 declined year-over-year for the first time since Q4 2010, driven by lower network related expenses and reduced content costs related primarily to AOL's reduced reliance on freelancers. Cost of revenue declines were partially offset by $9.4 million of increased TAC, as a result of continued growth in third party network advertising revenue, and $4.7 million of increased personnel costs related to 2011 headcount. General and administrative expenses year-over-year declines reflect a reduction in personnel costs including reduced corporate headcount in Q1 2012. Operating and net income grew meaningfully year-over-year driven by the aforementioned reduction in expenses, lower restructuring costs and a $22.7 million reduction in depreciation and amortization in Q1 2012 versus Q1 2011. The year-over-year decline in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects a decline of $19.6 million related to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2011. The year-over-year decline in depreciation and amortization in 2012 also reflects decommissioning certain network equipment, partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million primarily resulting from our 2011 and 2012 acquisitions.
Tax
The Company had pre-tax income from operations of $39.8 million and a related income tax expense of $18.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 47.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2012, as compared to an effective tax rate of 142.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2011. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2012 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to foreign losses that did not produce a tax benefit and due to a change in state tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2012 differed from the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to a $7.1 million income tax benefit in 2011 associated with a worthless stock deduction related to the sale of a subsidiary and favorable adjustments in 2011 of $8.2 million related to escrow disbursements from prior acquisitions for which we concluded we will be able to recognize a tax benefit.
Cash Flow
Q1 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $19.9 million while Free Cash Flow was a $9.5 million outflow. Cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow increased versus Q1 2011, primarily reflecting the growth in operating income, partially offset by incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter of 2012 related to prior year acquisitions. Free Cash Flow for the quarter was negative due to the payment of 2011 employee bonuses.
 
Subsequent Event
On April 5, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement ("the Purchase Agreement") to sell over 800 of our patents and their related patent applications (the "Patent Portfolio") to Microsoft, and to grant Microsoft a non-exclusive license to our retained patent portfolio, for aggregate proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion in cash (excluding transaction costs). The transaction is structured as a purchase of all of the outstanding shares of a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary and the direct acquisition of those patents in the Patent Portfolio not held by the subsidiary.
The closing is expected to occur by the end of the year. Both parties are required to use their reasonable best efforts to close the transaction within six months. However, this date may be extended by either party for 180 days, and if extended by Microsoft, a per day fee will apply. Microsoft would be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $211.2 million if the transaction is terminated other than by mutual written consent, if the Company's failure to perform a covenant is the cause of the termination or if the conditions to the agreement are met and the Company fails to close the transaction within two business days. Based on our utilization of tax losses generated by the sale of the subsidiary and existing deferred tax assets, we do not expect the $1.1 billion proceeds to result in material cash taxes.

The following table represents certain items that impacted the comparability of net income attributable to AOL Inc. for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (In millions, except per share amounts):
Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures are limited in not reflecting gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 8) asset impairments; 9) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 10) our ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 11) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities. In addition, matters relating to the sale of the Patent Portfolio to Microsoft are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, including, but not limited to the approval of the transaction by antitrust authorities and the satisfaction of the other closing conditions to the transaction as well as to factors that could affect the manner, timing and amount of the return of any of the sale proceeds to AOL shareholders including the need for AOL to retain cash for its business or to satisfy liabilities.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
The information that we disclose regarding unique visitors is based on data provided by a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). AOL unique visitors represent the estimated number of individuals who visited any content of a website or application owned by AOL or for which the traffic has been assigned to AOL by the owner during the applicable measurement period.
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations and asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

On June 15, 2012, AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation (AOL or the Company), announced that it closed a previously announced transaction with Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation (Microsoft) t
o sell over 800 of the Companys patents and their related patent applications (the Patent Portfolio) and to grant Microsoft a non-exclusive license to its retained patent portfolio, for aggregate proceeds of $1.056 billion in cash, 
pursuant to a definitive agreement (the Purchase Agreement) which the Company entered into with Microsoft on April 5, 2012.
 
At the closing of the transaction, the Company and Microsoft entered into an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement which provides for (i) a non-exclusive license to the Company for the use of all of the transferred patents in the Patent Portfolio and (ii) mutual releases with respect to claims arising from patents held by the other party prior to the closing. Additionally, the Company granted Microsoft a non-exclusive license under all the patents retained by the Company after the closing and Microsoft granted the Company certain defensive termination rights related to those retained patents.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released second quarter 2012 results today.
NEW YORK  July 25, 2012
"Today's results represent a significant milestone for AOL as we returned to Adjusted OIBDA growth for the first time in four years," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "The strong results and consumer performance we announced today are clear signs our strategic and operating efforts are translating into significant financial progress."

Asset, Cash & Cash Flow Trends:
 
 
 
 
Revenue
 
Global advertising revenue grew 6% year-over-year in Q2 2012, reflecting double-digit growth in Third Party Network revenue and growth in international display revenue, partially offset by declines in search and contextual revenue.
Global display revenue grew 2% year-over-year reflecting continued double-digit growth in international display advertising. Domestic display advertising revenue was flat year-over-year, versus a 1% and 5% decline on a reported and pro-forma basis, respectively in Q1 (pro-forma includes revenue from The Huffington Post in both periods). Domestic display revenue reflects growth in reserved inventory pricing and Patch revenue, partially offset by a decline in reserved impressions sold. International display revenue growth reflects continued growth in both the U.K. and Canada.
Third Party Network revenue increased $17.8 million, reflecting 11% growth in Advertising.com and $7.5 million related to the inclusion of Ad.com Japan. AOL began consolidating the joint venture in Q1 as a result of acquiring a controlling interest in the joint venture. Advertising.com growth reflects an increase in publishers on the network and increased sales of higher margin premium packages and products.
Search and contextual revenue trends continued to improve year-over-year with a 1% decline representing the lowest rate of decline in over 3 years. Search and contextual revenue declines primarily reflect a 12% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and fewer queries from cobranded portals and international markets, largely offset by continued growth in search revenue on AOL.com.
Subscription revenue declines reflect a 12% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers. The decline in subscription revenue was the lowest level of decline in over 5 years with the trend improvements reflecting continued improvements in churn and 2% growth in average revenue per user (ARPU). Monthly average churn fell from 2.2% in Q2 2011 to 1.7% in Q2 2012, driven primarily by significant subscriber retention efforts and by the continued maturation of the tenured base. ARPU growth reflects the impact of the price rationalization program AOL began in late Q3 2011, which significantly reduced the number of price points and more clearly defined and enhanced the value of our product offerings for consumers.
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues. Revenue from mobile carriers represented 28% of total "Other revenue" in Q2 2011 and 18% in Q2 2012.
 
Profitability
AOL's Adjusted OIBDA grew meaningfully year-over-year primarily reflecting $96.0 million related to income from licensing patents to Microsoft, growth in advertising revenue, lower general and administrative expenses and lower costs of revenues. Adjusted OIBDA was negatively impacted by $8.8 million of costs related to the proxy contest, $7.6 million of expenses associated with settling a state tax matter in Virginia and $5.6 million of costs related to the patent sale. Excluding the positive impact of the licensing income and the negative impacts of the proxy contest, tax settlement and patent transaction expenses, the remaining Adjusted OIBDA of $94.6 million was $18 million higher than Q2 2011. General and administrative expenses declined year-over-year reflecting a decline in personnel costs including reduced corporate headcount and a reduction in marketing costs. Costs of revenues continued to decline in Q2 2012, driven by lower network related expenses, personnel costs and reduced content costs related primarily to AOL's reduced reliance on freelancers. Cost of revenues declines were partially offset by $8.1 million of increased TAC, as a result of continued growth in third party network advertising revenue. In addition to the above, operating and net income year-over-year growth primarily reflects the gain on the sale of a portion of our patent portfolio to Microsoft (net of transaction costs) and a $24.1 million reduction in depreciation and amortization in Q2 2012 versus Q2 2011. The year-over-year decline in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects a decline of $17.3 million related to certain intangible assets being fully amortized and the decommissioning of certain network equipment.
Tax
AOL had pre-tax income from operations of $1,058.1 million and a related income tax expense of $87.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2012, as compared to a negative effective tax rate of 57.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2011. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2012 differed substantially from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the tax impact of the patent transaction with Microsoft. The patent transaction consisted of two elements: first, the sale of patents and the stock of a subsidiary, and second, the licensing of AOL's retained patent portfolio, resulting in pre-tax income of $1,041.8 million. No material cash taxes will be paid, due to existing net operating losses which offset substantially all of the ordinary income. However, for book purposes, this transaction resulted in income tax expense of $71.5 million. The tax expense relates primarily to ordinary income realized on the transaction, the majority of which is due to the licensing portion. In addition, the transaction created a significant net capital loss, for which a valuation allowance was recorded. In addition to the impacts of the patent transaction on income tax expense, AOL also had foreign losses that did not produce a tax benefit.
Cash Flow
Q2 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $167.2 million, while Free Cash Flow was $136.8 million. Cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow growth reflects the growth in operating income driven primarily by patent license income.
 
Modified Dutch Tender Offer
On June 28, 2012, AOL announced the first step in the multi-stage process of returning 100% of the patent transaction proceeds to shareholders through a $400 million modified Dutch auction tender offer. The $400 million aggregate purchase price of shares of common stock sought in the tender offer includes the approximately $40 million remaining from the initial $250 million stock repurchase authorized in August of 2011. The tender offer began on the date of the announcement, June 28, 2012, and will expire at 5:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) on August 2, 2012 unless extended or terminated earlier. Through the modified Dutch tender offer, AOL's shareholders will have the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price within the range of $27.00 to $30.00 per share. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, then shares of common stock having an aggregate purchase price of $400 million will be purchased, representing approximately 14% to 16% of AOL's issued and outstanding shares as of June 14, 2012 (depending on the final purchase price).

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments and write-offs. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 8) asset impairments; 9) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 10) our ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 11) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We use Adjusted OIBDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments and write-offs. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

On August 26, 2012, AOL Inc. ("AOL" or the "Company") entered into a fixed dollar collared accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. ("Barclays"), as agent for Barclays Bank PLC, effective August 27, 2012 (the "ASR Agreement"). Under the ASR Agreement, on August 30, 2012, AOL will pay $600 million from cash on hand to Barclays to repurchase outstanding shares of AOL common stock, par value $0.01 (the "Common Stock"), plus an additional payment equal to the present value of the special dividend announced on August 27, 2012 with respect to those shares deliverable under the ASR Agreement prior to the ex-dividend date of the special dividend. Also on August 30, 2012, Barclays will deliver approximately 4 million shares to AOL and those shares will be held in the treasury of the Company.
The specific number of shares that AOL ultimately will repurchase under the ASR Agreement will be based generally on the share price of AOL Common Stock over a valuation period in accordance with the terms of the ASR Agreement, subject to a floor and cap provision that establishes a minimum and maximum number of repurchased shares, and subject to an agreed adjustment for the value of the special dividend announced by the Company on August 27, 2012. The minimum and maximum share number will depend generally on the share price at which Barclays purchases shares of AOL's Common Stock during an initial hedging period, during which Barclays will establish an initial hedge position in respect of its obligations to deliver shares under the ASR Agreement. Barclays will be required to make additional share deliveries under the ASR Agreement after the initial hedge period, and AOL will receive delivery of a substantial majority of shares underlying the transaction before the end of the year. On final settlement of the ASR Agreement, AOL may be entitled to receive additional shares of AOL Common Stock, or, if it elects, cash, from Barclays, or, under certain circumstances specified in the ASR Agreement, AOL may be required to deliver shares or make a cash payment, at its option, to Barclays. In connection with this transaction, Barclays is expected to purchase AOL Common Stock in the open market.
The impact of the announcement today of the Company's special, one-time, cash dividend of $5.15 per share, payable on December 14, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2012 has been factored into the pricing mechanism in the ASR Agreement. Our estimated shares outstanding on December 5, 2012 for the purposes of calculating the dividend per share amount represents our estimate of the shares outstanding on that date plus all unvested employee restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards. For purposes of calculating the dividend per share, the shares that Barclays will deliver to AOL prior to the ex-dividend date are included in the calculation even though for accounting purposes they will be excluded from our weighted average shares outstanding. This is due to the fact that Barclays will receive the present value of the dividend attributable to those shares at the beginning of the ASR Agreement.
The ASR Agreement contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase transaction, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares that will be delivered (as well as minimum and maximum share amounts), the required timing of delivery of the shares, the specific circumstances under which Barclays is permitted to make adjustments to the transaction, the specific circumstances under which the transaction may be terminated early, certain circumstances under which Barclays could be entitled to deliver fewer than the minimum number of shares (or AOL could be required to deliver shares or cash, at its option, to Barclays), and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by AOL and Barclays to one another.
The Company will file a copy of the ASR Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. The above summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ASR Agreement.
The information set forth under Item 3.03 below of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
 
On August 26, 2012, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock. The dividend is payable to stockholders of record of the Company as of the close of business on September 7, 2012.
The following is a summary description of the Rights. This summary is intended to provide a general description and should be read together with the Tax Asset Protection Plan, dated as of August 27, 2012, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Plan"), a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
The Plan was adopted in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that the Company's ability to use its net operating losses, capital losses and certain "built-in losses" (collectively, the "Tax Attributes") to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. The Company has substantial Tax Attributes. Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Company may carry forward or otherwise utilize these Tax Attributes in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce the Company's federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the Tax Attributes do not otherwise become limited, the Company believes that it will have available a significant amount of Tax Attributes in future years, and therefore these Tax Attributes could be a substantial asset to the Company. However, if the Company experiences an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, its ability to use the Tax Attributes may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Attributes could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. A company experiences an "ownership change" for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
The Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock without the approval of the Board. Stockholders who beneficially own 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as of the execution of the Plan will not trigger the Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock. In addition, changes in beneficial ownership solely as a result of a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including as a result of repurchases under the ASR Agreement) will not trigger the Plan.
. One Right will be issued for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 7, 2012. One Right will also be issued together with each share of Common Stock issued after September 7, 2012 but before the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, after the Distribution Date.
The Rights
 
Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth of a share of the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock") for a purchase price of $100 (the "Purchase Price"). If issued, each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of Common Stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.
. The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) ten business days after a public announcement that a person has become an "Acquiring Person" by acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of a person that had beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as of the execution of the Plan, by obtaining beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock) and (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be specified by the Board prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by or on behalf of a person that, if completed, would result in such person becoming an Acquiring Person.
Initial Exercisability
The Company refers to the date that the Rights become exercisable as the "Distribution Date." Until the Distribution Date, Common Stock certificates or the ownership statements issued with respect to uncertificated shares of Common Stock will evidence the Rights. Any transfer of shares of Common Stock prior to the Distribution Date will also constitute a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, separate rights certificates will be issued and the Rights may be transferred other than in connection with the transfer of the underlying shares of Common Stock unless and until the Board has determined to effect an exchange pursuant to the Plan (as described below).
. In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or, under certain circumstances, were beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, a number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
Flip-In Event
At any time until a person becomes an "Acquiring Person", the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption.
. At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). Immediately upon an exchange of any Rights, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only
Exchange
 
right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the number of shares of Common Stock (or fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the exchange ratio. The Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock.
. The Rights and the Plan will expire on the earlier of (i) the Close of Business on the earlier of (a) August 27, 2015 or (b) August 27, 2013 if stockholder approval of the Plan has not been received by or on such date, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Plan, (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full pursuant to the Plan, (iv) the effective date of the repeal of both Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provisions or replacement provisions, if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits or (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company for which the Board determines that the Company has or will have no Tax Benefits.
Expiration
. The Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or other securities or assets issuable and the number of outstanding Rights to prevent dilution that may occur as a result of certain events, including among others, a stock dividend, a stock split or a reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock. With certain exceptions, no adjustments to the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
. For so long as the Rights are redeemable, the Board may supplement or amend any provision of the Plan in any respect without the approval of the holders of the Rights. From and after the time the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Board may supplement or amend the Plan only to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions, or to make any additional changes to the Plan which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, but only to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder (other than an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or certain of their transferees) and do not result in the Rights again becoming redeemable or the Plan again becoming amendable other than in accordance with this sentence.
Amendments
The above description of the Plan has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan and the exhibits thereto.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
In connection with the adoption of the Plan described in Item 3.03 above, on August 27, 2012, the Company will file a Certificate of Designation, Preferences, and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A copy of the form of Certificate of Designation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.
 
On August 27, 2012, the Company also announced that the Company declared a special cash dividend, in the amount of $5.15 per outstanding share of Common Stock, to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2012. It is anticipated that the special dividend will be paid on December 14, 2012.
Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. With respect to the special cash dividend declared by the Company, the Board may, in its sole discretion, adjust the per share special dividend amount to reflect certain extraordinary corporate transactions or events that may be effected prior to the tenth day before the dividend record date that would materially affect the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the SEC. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) our ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the ASR Agreement, including but not limited to the timing and amount of any payments made and shares repurchased; 2) our ability to pay the special cash dividend, including but not limited to the timing and amounts paid pursuant to the dividend; 3) fluctuations in the market price of our shares; 4) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 5) continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 6) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 7) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 8) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 9) market adoption of new products and services; 10) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 11)
 
asset impairments; 12) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 13) our ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 14) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities or of security breaches or privacy concerns.

Board of Directors
Certificate of Incorporation
RESOLVED, that a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof are as follows:
Section 1. . The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and the number of shares constituting such series shall be fifty thousand (50,000).
Designation and Amount
Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the ""), and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise),
Common Stock
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after August 26, 2012 (the "") (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation), then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Rights Dividend Declaration Date
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") that shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors.
default period
(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. If the number that may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
provided
pari
passu
(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Board of Directors. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to such holder at such holder's last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall have exercised their right to elect two directors, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock that elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
provided
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.

(h) Unless the Company has exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i) hereof, upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 11(b) or Section 11(c) hereof, each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest one one-millionth of a share of Preferred Stock) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
(i) The Company may elect, on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price, to adjust the number of Rights in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. The Company shall also, as promptly as practicable, notify the Rights Agent in writing of same pursuant to Section 9(e) hereof and give the Rights Agent a copy of such announcement. Such record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but if the Rights Certificates have been issued, such record date shall be at least 10 calendar days later than the date of the public announcement. If Rights Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Rights Certificates on such record date Rights Certificates evidencing, subject to the provision of Section 13 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders are entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Rights Certificates
 
held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof if required by the Company, new Rights Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders are entitled after such adjustment. Rights Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed, and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Rights Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j) Without respect to any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number or kind of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Rights Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number and kind of securities which were expressed in the initial Rights Certificate issued hereunder.
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below one ten-thousandth of the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock or below the then par value, if any, of any other securities of the Company issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities, as the case may be, at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(l) In any case in which this Section 11 otherwise requires that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent) until the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company delivers to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares of Preferred Stock or other securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

(m) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that in its good faith judgment the Board determines to be necessary or advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the shares of Preferred Stock, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of shares of Preferred Stock at less than the Current Per Share Market Price therefor, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of shares of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Preferred Stock, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its shares of Preferred Stock is not taxable to such stockholders.
(n) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company at any time after the Record Date and prior to the Distribution Date (i) pays a dividend on the outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) combines the outstanding shares of
 
Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter but prior to the Distribution Date (or issued or delivered on or after the Distribution Date pursuant to Section 21 hereof), shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any such event equals the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be made successively whenever such a dividend is paid or such a subdivision, combination or reclassification is effected.
Whenever an adjustment is made or any event affecting the Rights or their exercisability (including, without limitation, an event which causes Rights to become null and void) occurs as provided in Section 11 thereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts and calculations accounting for such adjustment or describing such event, (b) file with the Rights Agent, and with each transfer agent for the shares of Preferred Stock and the shares of Common Stock, a copy of such certificate, and (c) if a Distribution Date has occurred, give a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Rights Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment or statement therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate, , , that the Rights Agent will not be entitled to such protection in cases of bad faith or willful misconduct.

Section 13 Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.
(a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights, except prior to the Distribution Date as provided in Section 11(n) hereof, or to distribute Rights Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Right. For purposes of this Section 13(a), the current market value of one Right is the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any Trading Day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the
 
high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported on a quotation system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights, such market maker to be selected by the Board. If the Rights are not publicly held or are not so listed or traded, or are not the subject of available bid and asked quotes, the current market value of one Right shall mean the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
(b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock). Fractions of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of such Preferred Stock may, in the sole discretion of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, provided that such agreement provides that the holders of such depositary receipts have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as Beneficial Owners of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that are not integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the Company may pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. For purposes of this Section 13(b), the current market value of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock shall be one ten-thousandth of the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise; , , that if the closing price of the shares of the Preferred Stock cannot be so determined, the closing price of the shares of the Preferred Stock for such Trading Day shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to the closing price of the shares of Common Stock for such Trading Day multiplied by ten thousand (as such number may be appropriately adjusted to reflect events such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions relating to the Common Stock shares occurring after the date of this Agreement).
provided

(c) Following the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, the Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock upon exercise or exchange of the Rights or to distribute certificates or Ownership Statements which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock. In lieu of issuing any such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company may pay to any Person to whom or which such fractional shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one such share of Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 13(c), the current market value of one share of Common Stock shall be the closing price thereof (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) hereof) on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise or exchange.
(d) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Rights expressly waives such holder's right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right, except as permitted by this Section 13.
 
(e) Whenever a payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock is to be made by the Rights Agent, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payments and the prices and/or formulas utilized in calculating such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient monies to the Rights Agent in the form of fully collected funds to make such payments. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock under any Section of this Agreement relating to the payment of fractional Rights or fractional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock unless and until the Rights Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.
Section 14 Rights of Action.
(a) All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent hereunder, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Rights Certificates (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of shares of Common Stock); and any registered holder of any Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the shares of Common Stock), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the shares of Common Stock), may, on such first holder's behalf and for such first holder's own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such first holder's right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Rights Certificate in the manner provided in such Rights Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and shall be entitled to specific performance of the obligations hereunder and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations hereunder of any Person subject to this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, judgment, decree or ruling (whether interlocutory or final) issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental regulatory, self-regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation, or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; , , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such injunction, order, judgment, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.

rights hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly. The costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification will also be paid by the Company.

(b) The Rights Agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in connection with, its acceptance or administration of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties and responsibilities and the exercise of its rights hereunder, in reliance upon any Rights Certificate or certificate evidencing shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities of the Company or an Ownership Statement, or any instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 19 hereof.

If at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of a predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and if at that time any of the Rights Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in the name of the predecessor or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.

The Rights Agent undertakes to perform the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Section 19 Duties of the Rights Agent.
(a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company and/or an employee of the Rights Agent), and the advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the content of such advice or opinion.

(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

(e) The Rights Agent will have no liability in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or failure by the Company to satisfy any condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the provisions of Section 11, Section 22 or Section 23 hereof or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 hereof, describing any such change or adjustment, upon which the Rights Agent may rely); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall, when so issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f) The Company agrees that it shall perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of its duties under this Agreement.
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties and the exercise of the rights hereunder from any Authorized Officer, and to apply to any such Authorized Officer for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with such instructions. The Rights Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying upon the most recent instructions received from any such Authorized Officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent under this Agreement and the date on or after which such action shall be taken, suffered or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking or suffering any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken.
(h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, affiliate, director, officer, agent or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent or any stockholder, affiliate, director, officer, agent or employee from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers or employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, omission, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) in the selection and continued employment thereof.
(j) If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the form of election
 
to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been completed or indicates an affirmative response to clause 1 or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.
(k) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(l) The Rights Agent will not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any fact, event or determination (including, without limitation, any dates or events defined in this Agreement or the designation of any Person as an Acquiring Person, Affiliate or Associate) under this Agreement unless and until the Rights Agent is specifically notified in writing by the Company of such fact, event or determination, and the Rights Agent shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability for failing to take any action in connection therewith unless and until it has received such written notice.
(m) The provisions of this Section 19 shall survive the exercise, exchange, redemption or expiration of the Rights, the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent and the termination of this Agreement.
The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 calendar days' written notice given to the Company in accordance with Section 25 hereof, and to each transfer agent (other than, if serving as a transfer agent, the Rights Agent) of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock known to the Rights Agent, respectively, by registered or certified mail. If the Rights Agent is serving as a transfer agent to the Company, and is terminated as transfer agent, the Rights Agent will be deemed to have resigned automatically and be discharged from its duties as Rights Agent under this Agreement as of the effective date of such termination, and the Company shall be responsible for sending any required notices of such termination to holders of the Rights Certificates. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 calendar days' written notice, given to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 25 hereof, and to each transfer agent of the shares of Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, by registered or certified mail, and, if such removal occurs after the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Rights Certificates in accordance with Section 25 hereof. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 calendar days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Rights Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then any registered holder of any Rights Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a legal business entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United
Section 20 Change of the Rights Agent.
 
States or of any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise shareholder services powers and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent, together with its Affiliates, a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an Affiliate of a legal business entity described in clause (a) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the shares of Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, and, if such appointment occurs after the Distribution Date, give a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates in accordance with Section 25 hereof. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 20, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by the Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Rights Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, granted or awarded as of the Distribution Date, or upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities hereinafter issued by the Company and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; , , that (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, in its good faith judgment the Board determines that the issuance of such Rights Certificate could have a material adverse tax consequence to the Company or to the Person to whom or which such Rights Certificate otherwise would be issued, and (ii) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

(a) The Board may, at any time prior to the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event redeem all but not less than all of the then-outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price. The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, securities or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board.

Board of Directors
Certificate of Incorporation
RESOLVED, that a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof are as follows:

Designation and Amount
Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the ""), and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after August 26, 2012 (the "") (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation), then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Rights Dividend Declaration Date
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on
 
all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") that shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors.
default period
(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. If the number that may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Board of Directors. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to such holder at such holder's last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall have exercised their right to elect two directors, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock that elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.

As provided in the Plan, the Purchase Price, the number or kind of shares of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) which may be purchased upon the exercise of the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.
This Rights Certificate is subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan, which terms, provisions and conditions are hereby incorporated herein by reference and
 
made a part hereof and to which Plan reference is hereby made for a full description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Rights Agent, the Company and the holders of the Rights Certificates, which limitations of rights include the temporary suspension of the exercisability of the Rights under the circumstances specified in the Plan. Copies of the Plan are on file at the principal executive offices of the Company and can be obtained from the Company without charge upon written request therefor.
Pursuant to the Plan, from and after the occurrence of any Person becoming an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are beneficially owned by (i) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (ii) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the occurrence of such Person becoming an Acquiring Person or (iii) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with such Person becoming an Acquiring Person pursuant to either (a) a transfer from the Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding, written or otherwise, regarding the transferred Rights or (b) a transfer that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has the purpose or effect of avoiding certain provisions of the Plan, will be null and void without any further action and any holder of such Rights will thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights, whether under any provision of the Plan or otherwise. From and after the occurrence of any Person becoming an Acquiring Person, no Rights Certificate will be issued that represents Rights that are or have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, and any Rights Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of the Plan will be cancelled.
This Rights Certificate, with or without other Rights Certificates, may be exchanged for another Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates entitling the holder to purchase a like number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) as the Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates surrendered entitled such holder (or former holder in the case of a transfer) to purchase, upon presentation and surrender hereof at the office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, with the Form of Assignment (if appropriate) and the related Certificate duly executed.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate may be redeemed by the Company at its option at a redemption price of $0.00001 per Right at any time prior to the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event. In addition, following the time any person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company may at its option exchange the Rights, in whole or in part, for shares of common stock, Preferred Stock or other preferred stock having equivalent rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Stock. The Plan may be supplemented and amended by the Company, as provided therein.
The Company is not required to issue fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the option of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) or other securities issuable, as the case may be, upon the exercise of any Right or Rights evidenced hereby. In lieu of issuing fractional shares of Preferred Stock or other securities, the Company may make a cash payment, as provided in the Plan.
 
No holder of this Rights Certificate, as such, will be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares of the Preferred Stock or of any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable upon the exercise of the Right or Rights represented hereby, nor will anything contained herein or in the Plan be construed to confer upon the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in the Plan), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate have been exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
This Rights Certificate will not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until it has been countersigned by the Rights Agent.

Exhibit C
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS SET FORTH IN THE TAX ASSET PROTECTION PLAN, RIGHTS THAT ARE OR WERE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR ANY AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE OF AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE TAX ASSET PROTECTION PLAN) MAY BECOME NULL AND VOID.
On August 26, 2012, a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the "") of AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a "") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company. The dividend is payable to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 7, 2012.
Board
Company
Right
This summary of rights provides only a general description and should be read together with the Tax Asset Protection Plan, dated as of August 27, 2012, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the ""). All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. Upon written request, the Company will provide a copy of the Plan free of charge to any of its stockholders.
Plan
The Plan was adopted in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses, capital losses and certain "built-in losses" (collectively, the "") to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. We have substantial Tax Attributes. Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may carry forward or otherwise utilize these Tax Attributes in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the Tax Attributes do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will have available a significant amount of Tax Attributes in future years, and therefore these Tax Attributes could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use the Tax Attributes may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Attributes could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. A company experiences an "ownership change" for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
Tax Attributes
The Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of our Board. Stockholders who beneficially own 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock upon execution of the Plan will not trigger the Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.
 
. One Right was issued for each outstanding share of our common stock to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 7, 2012. One Right will also be issued together with each share of our common stock issued after September 7, 2012 but before the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, after the Distribution Date. Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from us one ten-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "") for a purchase price of $100 (the ""). If issued, each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of our common stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.
The Rights
Series A Preferred Stock
Purchase Price
. The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) ten business days after a public announcement that a person has become an "Acquiring Person" by acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock (or, in the case of a person that had beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock upon execution of the Plan, by obtaining beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock or (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be specified by the Board prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by or on behalf of a person that, if completed, would result in such person becoming an Acquiring Person.
Initial Exercisability
We refer to the date that the Rights become exercisable as the "." Until the Distribution Date, our common stock certificates or the ownership statements issued with respect to uncertificated shares of common stock will evidence the Rights. Any transfer of shares of common stock prior to the Distribution Date will also constitute a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, separate rights certificates will be issued and the Rights may be transferred other than in connection with the transfer of the underlying shares of common stock unless and until our Board has determined to effect an exchange pursuant to the Plan (as described below).
Distribution Date
. In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or, under certain circumstances, were beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
Flip-In Event
At any time until a person becomes an "Acquiring Person", the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per Right (the ""). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption.
Redemption Price
. At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an
Exchange
 
exchange ratio of one share of common stock, or a fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). Immediately upon an exchange of any Rights, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the number of shares of common stock (or fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the exchange ratio. The Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
. The Rights and the Plan will expire on the earlier of (i) the Close of Business on the earlier of (a) August 27, 2015 or (b) August 27, 2013 if stockholder approval of the Plan has not been received by or on such date, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Plan, (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full pursuant to the Plan, (iv) the effective date of the repeal of both Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provisions or replacement provisions, if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits or (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company for which the Board determines that the Company has or will have no Tax Benefits.
Expiration
. Our Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or other securities or assets issuable and the number of outstanding Rights to prevent dilution that may occur as a result of certain events, including among others, a stock dividend, a stock split or a reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock. With certain exceptions, no adjustments to the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
. For so long as the Rights are redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend any provision of the Plan in any respect without the approval of the holders of the Rights. From and after the time the Rights are no longer redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend the Plan only to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions, or to make any additional changes to the Plan which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, but only to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder (other than an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or certain of their transferees) and do not result in the Rights again becoming redeemable or the Plan again becoming amendable other than in accordance with this sentence.
Amendments
The Company has filed a copy of the Plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed on August 27, 2012. In addition, a copy of the Plan is available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, Monday, August 27, 2012 AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) announced today its final steps in returning approximately $1.1 billion to AOL shareholders in 2012, entering into a $600 million fixed-dollar collared Accelerated Stock Repurchase Agreement ("ASR Agreement") with Barclays Bank plc. ("Barclays") and announcing its authorization of a $5.15 per share special cash dividend.
"Today's announcement underscores AOL's commitment to delivering value for our shareholders," said AOL Chairman and CEO, Tim Armstrong. "AOL remains committed to creating and unlocking value for all shareholders through smart execution and disciplined management of our asset portfolio."
AOL has agreed to repurchase $600 million worth of common stock under the ASR Agreement, utilizing the share repurchase authorization previously approved and an incremental $10 million authorized by the Company on August 26. AOL will pay the $600 million at the beginning of the ASR Agreement and expects to receive shares throughout the remainder of the year and a substantial majority of the shares underlying the transaction before year-end, including approximately 4 million shares that Barclays will deliver to AOL on August 30. The specific number of shares AOL will ultimately repurchase under the ASR Agreement will be based on a discount to the volume-weighted average share price of AOL common stock during the agreement period adjusted down by $5.15 for the payment of the special dividend. The purchase price will also be subject to floor and cap provisions establishing a minimum and maximum number of repurchased shares.
Additionally, the Company authorized a special, one-time, cash dividend of $5.15 per share, payable on December 14, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2012. Our estimated shares outstanding on December 5, 2012 for the purposes of calculating the dividend per share amount represents our estimate of the number of shares outstanding on that date plus all unvested employee restricted stock unit awards ("RSUs") and performance stock unit awards ("PSUs"). For purposes of calculating the dividend per share, the shares that Barclays will deliver to AOL prior to the ex-dividend date on November 30, 2012 are included in the calculation even though for accounting purposes they will be excluded from our weighted average number of shares outstanding. This is due to the fact that Barclays will receive approximately $54 million, representing the present value of the dividend attributable to those shares at the beginning of the ASR Agreement. AOL expects to announce the anticipated treatment of the dividend for tax purposes prior to the ex-dividend date.
"Since becoming a public company in December 2009, we have demonstrated an ability to both unlock and prudently manage our valuable asset portfolio, including our tax assets," said AOL
 
Chief Operating Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Artie Minson. "Today we have done both again, outlining a clear path to returning $1.1 billion in cash to shareholders, while putting in place a necessary mechanism to ensure the preservation of our valuable tax assets."
As a result, due to our desire to preserve our large domestic tax attributes which could be significantly impaired should a "change of control" be triggered under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company has adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan intended to act as a deterrent to any individual, individual fund or family of funds with common dispositive power acquiring 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding shares without the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2012, AOL had several domestic tax attributes, including net operating losses of approximately $130 million after-tax which expire over a period ranging from five to twenty years, and capital loss carry-forwards, of approximately $500 million after-tax, which expire over a period ranging from three to five years. Unless otherwise restricted, AOL can utilize these tax attributes in certain circumstances to offset future U.S. taxable income, including in connection with capital gains that may be generated from a potential asset sale. AOL believes the implementation of the Tax Asset Protection Plan will serve the interests of all shareholders given the size of its domestic tax assets and the potential damage that could occur should a change of control occur. This plan is similar to other arrangements adopted by many other public companies with significant tax attributes. The rights will expire on August 27, 2015, or such earlier time as the Company's Board of Directors determines that the Company has no remaining designated tax attributes as of the beginning of a taxable year. The Company also intends to submit the Tax Asset Protection Plan for stockholder approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders.
In connection with the payment of the special cash dividend and in accordance with and pursuant to the AOL Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, the Company will make an equitable adjustment to outstanding stock options, such that the fair value of employee awards immediately following the dividend will be unchanged from the fair value prior to the dividend. In addition, individuals who hold RSUs and PSUs will be paid out the special dividend as the respective RSUs and PSUs vest. The Company does not expect to record any material incremental compensation expense in connection with the adjustment of stock options or payment of dividends on RSUs and PSUs.
Additional information regarding the Tax Asset Protection Plan, the ASR Agreement and the special cash dividend will be set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. With respect to the special cash dividend declared by the Company, the Board may, in its sole discretion, adjust the per share special dividend amount to reflect certain extraordinary corporate transactions or events that may be effected prior to the tenth day before the dividend record date that would materially affect the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the SEC. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including growth in operations and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) our ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the ASR Agreement, including but not limited to the timing and amount of any payments made and shares repurchased; 2) our ability to pay the special cash dividend, including but not limited to the timing and amounts paid pursuant to the dividend; 3) fluctuations in the market price of our shares; 4) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 5) continual decline in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 6) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 7) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 8) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 9)
 
 
market adoption of new products and services; 10) the failure to meet earnings expectations; 11) asset impairments; 12) decreased liquidity in the capital markets; 13) our ability to access the capital markets for debt securities or bank financings; and 14) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities or of security breaches or privacy concerns.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Employment Agreement of the Chief Operating Officer
On September 7, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved a new employment agreement dated as of September 10, 2012 and effective as of September 7, 2012, (the "Agreement") between the Company and Mr. Arthur Minson in connection with Mr. Minson's promotion to the position of Chief Operating Officer. The Agreement supersedes and replaces the prior employment agreement between AOL LLC (the Company's predecessor in interest) and Mr. Minson, dated August 24, 2009 and effective as of September 8, 2009. The Agreement provides for Mr. Minson to continue to serve as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer through September 6, 2016 (the "Term Date"). If at the Term Date, Mr. Minson's employment has not been terminated previously and Mr. Minson and the Company have not agreed to an extension or renewal of the Agreement or to the terms of a new employment agreement, Mr. Minson's employment term shall continue on a month-to-month basis subject to termination by either party on 30 days' written notice. The Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $850,000 and target annual incentive bonus opportunity of 200% of his base salary.
The Agreement substantially conforms to the material terms established by the Company with respect to all of its executive officers. As a result, the Agreement provides a reduction in some benefits to Mr. Minson compared to his prior employment agreement that was entered into prior to the Company's spin-off from Time Warner Inc., including a reduction in the amount of cash severance benefits, the payment of cash severance benefits over time rather than in a lump sum, and no acceleration of vesting for future equity awards upon a termination without cause.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released third quarter 2012 results today.
NEW YORK  November 6, 2012
"We just reported the best relative revenue performance in seven years and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit growth, exceeding our expectations," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "We have positioned AOL for growth in 2013 and beyond with consumer and advertiser demand growing for our premium content and innovative products, video, services and ad formats."

Revenue
 
Total revenue was flat year-over-year, representing AOL's best year-over-year revenue performance in 7 years.
Global advertising revenue grew 7% year-over-year in Q3 2012, reflecting continued double-digit growth in Third Party Network revenue, growth in Search and Contextual revenue for the first time in over 3 years and double-digit growth in international display revenue, partially offset by a decline in domestic display revenue.
Third Party Network revenue increased 18%, reflecting 8% growth in Advertising.com revenues and $9.6 million related to the inclusion of Ad.com Japan, which AOL began consolidating in Q1 2012. Advertising.com growth reflects an increase in publishers on the network and increased sales of premium packages and products, including video.
Search and contextual revenue grew year-over-year for the first time in over 3 years, driven by continued growth in search revenue on AOL.com through the optimization of both the consumer and advertiser experiences and by increased queries from marketing related efforts. Search and contextual revenue growth was impacted by a decline in queries from domestic AOL-brand access subscribers and from cobranded portals.
Global display revenue declined 1% year-over-year, reflecting a 3% decline in domestic display revenue, partially offset by double-digit growth in international display advertising revenue. Domestic display revenue declined due to a reduction in the sale of reserved inventory, but was partially offset by an increase in the number of impressions sold through Ad.com, growth in reserved pricing due to the increased sales of premium formats and video and strong revenue growth from Patch. International display revenue growth reflects continued growth in both the UK and Canada.
Subscription revenue declined 10%, its lowest rate of decline in over 6 years driven by continued lower churn versus the prior year period and 6% growth in domestic average monthly subscription revenue per AOL-brand access subscriber (ARPU), partially offset by a 16% decline in domestic AOL-brand access subscribers. ARPU growth reflects the impact of an ongoing price rationalization program. The program began in Q3 2011 and included the migration of certain individuals who had not previously received access service (and therefore were not included as domestic AOL-brand access subscribers) to a higher priced plan with additional services including the access service. This program, as previously disclosed, increased the number of AOL-brand access subscribers by approximately 200,000, positively impacting the total number of subscribers beginning in Q3 2011 and accounting for the sequential increase in the rate of decline in subscribers from 12% in Q2 to 16% in Q3 2012.
 
Revenue Continued
Other revenue declines primarily reflect lower mobile carrier revenues. Revenue from mobile carriers represented 24% of total "Other revenue" in Q3 2011 and 8% in Q3 2012.
Profitability
AOL's operating income and Adjusted OIBDA grew meaningfully year-over-year primarily reflecting growth in advertising revenue, and lower costs of revenues. Costs of revenues continued to decline in Q3 2012, driven by lower network related expenses, personnel costs and reduced content costs related primarily to AOL's reduced reliance on freelancers. Cost of revenues declines were partially offset by $13.1 million of increased TAC, primarily due to continued growth in Third Party Network advertising. Net and operating income also benefitted from a year-over-year decline in depreciation and amortization of $17.6 million related to certain intangible assets being fully amortized and the decommissioning of certain network equipment.
Tax
AOL had pre-tax income from operations of $45.1 million and a related income tax expense of $24.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 54.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to an effective tax rate of 136.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2012 differed substantially from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to foreign losses that did not produce a tax benefit.
On August 27
th
, AOL adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the "TAPP") in an effort to preserve its significant domestic tax attributes, the utilization of which could be prohibited or significantly delayed should a "change of control" be triggered under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TAPP is intended to act as a deterrent to any individual, individual fund or family of funds with common dispositive power of acquiring 4.9% or more of the AOL's outstanding shares without the approval of the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted, AOL can utilize these tax attributes in certain circumstances to offset future U.S. taxable income, including in connection with capital gains that may be generated from a potential asset sale. AOL believes the implementation of the TAPP will serve the interests of all shareholders given the size of its domestic tax assets and the potential damage that could occur should a change of control occur. This plan is similar to other arrangements adopted by many other public companies with significant tax attributes.
Cash Flow
Q3 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $101.8 million, while Free Cash Flow was $71.5 million, up 23% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow growth both reflect the year-over-year improvement in operating income.
 
Accelerated Stock Repurchase Agreement and Special Cash Dividend
On August 26, 2012, AOL entered into the ASR Agreement with Barclays effective August 27, 2012. Under the ASR Agreement, on August 30, 2012, we paid $654.1 million from cash on hand to Barclays to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock. The consideration paid to Barclays included $54.1 million in contemplation of the special cash dividend discussed further below, which was calculated as the present value of the special cash dividend with respect to those shares deliverable under the ASR Agreement prior to the ex-dividend date. The purchase price is also subject to floor and cap provisions establishing a minimum and maximum number of repurchased shares. The special cash dividend will be payable on December 14, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2012, with an ex-dividend date of December 3, 2012.

The following table represents certain items that impacted the comparability of net income attributable to AOL Inc. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except per share amounts):
Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and noncash asset impairments and write-offs. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, capitalized product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of our total advertising network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including improved financial results and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) potential fluctuation in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) our ability to attract and retain unique visitors to our properties; 8) asset impairments; and 9) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We use Adjusted OIBDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues) and non-cash asset impairments and write-offs. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings and gains and losses on asset sales, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

In Q4 2012, AOL began to manage its business on a segmented basis, and therefore is presenting financial information for Q4 2012 and historical periods on the same basis as that reviewed by our management. Our segments are defined by the products and services they provide and by how we evaluate our business. The following are AOL's reportable segments:
 
 
 
Additionally, AOL has a corporate and other category that includes activities that are not directly attributable or allocable to a specific segment. This category primarily consists of costs associated with broad corporate functions including legal, human resources, finance and accounting, and activities not directly attributable to a segment such as AOL Ventures, restructuring costs, tax settlements and other general business costs. In 2012, the corporate and other category also includes income from the sale and licensing of patents of $1,042 million (net of transaction costs) and patent and proxy contest expenses of $15.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively. In 2010, this category includes the $1,414.4 million goodwill impairment charge.
The following table highlights the significant products or services included in each segment:
 
 
 
Brand Group
Brand Group revenue reflects continued growth in search revenue and international display revenue, which offsets a slight decline in domestic display revenue. Search advertising revenue grew 20% year-over-year driven by continued growth in revenue per search on AOL.com through the optimization of the consumer experience and by increased queries from marketing related efforts. Search revenue growth on AOL.com more than offset a decline in queries from cobranded portals. International display revenue in our Brand Group grew strongly driven by continued growth in Canada and the UK, but was offset by domestic display revenue declines primarily due to an increase in inventory sold through Advertising.com. Domestic display declines were partially offset by growth in reserved pricing and continued growth in the sale of video and Patch inventory. Under our segment reporting structure, Brand Group inventory sold through AOL Networks is recognized in AOL Networks with a corresponding intersegment TAC charge. An amount equal to the TAC charge, reflecting the revenue net of the margin retained by AOL Networks, is then reflected as intersegment revenue within the Brand Group.
Brand Group Adjusted OIBDA declined versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased investment in our editorial staff domestically and internationally, an increase in the number of front line sales representatives, particularly in video, and increased marketing expenses. These declines were partially offset by the growth in revenue discussed above and lower year-over-year Patch expenses.
Membership Group
Membership Group revenue reflects a 10% decline in subscription revenue driven by 15% fewer domestic AOL-brand access subscribers year-over-year. Subscription revenue year-over-year declines remained near multi-year lows due to a continued historically low churn rate of 1.8% and 8% year-over-year growth in domestic average monthly revenue per AOL-brand access subscriber (ARPU). Subscription revenue grew sequentially due to 4% growth in ARPU versus Q3 2012. ARPU growth continues to reflect the impact of an ongoing price rationalization program and continued improvement in our retention efforts. Membership
 
Membership Group continued 
 
Group revenue declines also reflect fewer reserved impressions sold, primarily on AOL Mail, and a shift in the sale of those impressions to Advertising.com. As is the case in the Brand Group, this revenue is recognized net of the margin retained by AOL Networks. Membership Group advertising revenue declines were partially offset by growth in search revenue.
Membership Group Adjusted OIBDA declines primarily reflect the decline in subscribers during the quarter.
AOL Networks
AOL Networks revenue increased 37% versus the prior year period, driven by 31% growth in Third Party Network revenue, which included $9.2 million in advertising revenue sold by Ad.com Japan (AOL began consolidating Ad.com Japan in Q1 2012). Third Party Network revenue reflects revenue from the sale of inventory from third party properties through Advertising.com and its growth continues to be driven by an increasing number of publishers and advertisers on the network as well as increased sales of premium packages and products. AOL Networks revenue growth also reflects an 88% increase in the sale of AOL Properties inventory sold through Advertising.com.
As a result of the growth in revenues, AOL Networks related TAC increased by 29% as compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenues net of TAC was a significant driver in the improvement of AOL Networks Adjusted OIBDA versus the prior year period. Other factors impacting AOL Networks Adjusted OIBDA included a decline in retention compensation expenses and increased year-over-year investment in higher growth areas, particularly in technology and personnel as we continue to build out the capabilities of our technology stack.
Corporate & Other
Corporate & Other Adjusted OIBDA decreased versus the prior year period due to increases in personnel expenses related to 2012 performance bonuses and increased marketing costs versus the prior year period, largely offset by continued expense reduction initiatives.
Tax
AOL had Q4 2012 pre-tax income of $67.1 million and income tax expense of $31.7 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 47.2%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 57.7% for Q4 2011. The effective tax rate for Q4 2012 differed substantially from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the impact of foreign losses that did not produce a tax benefit and the impact of changes in state tax rates and apportionment on AOL's deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate in Q4 2011 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate due to the size of foreign losses relative to AOL's pre-tax income and the unfavorable impact of restricted stock unit vesting in Q4 2011.
 
Cash Flow
Q4 2012 cash provided by operating activities was $76.7 million, while Free Cash Flow was $46.3 million, both declining year-over-year reflecting timing of receivable collections, increased marketing expenditures, acquisition-related bonus and retention payments in Q4 2012 and the Q4 2012 payment of a special year-end employee bonus as a result of the patent transaction.

Items impacting comparability:
 
 
 
 
 
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues), noncash asset impairments and write-offs and special items. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings, gains and losses on asset sales and special items, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales, impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets or special items which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, capitalized product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of the AOL Advertising Network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including improved financial results and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) potential fluctuation in market valuations associated with our cash flows and revenues; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) our ability to attract and retain unique visitors to our properties; 8) asset impairments; and 9) the impact of "cyber-warfare" or terrorist acts and hostilities.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We use Adjusted OIBDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets (including those recorded in costs of revenues), non-cash asset impairments and write-offs and special items. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings, gains and losses on asset sales and special items, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales, impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets or special items which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.

(e) 2013 AOL Inc. Annual Bonus Plan
On March 27, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AOL Inc. (the "Company") approved the material terms of the 2013 AOL Inc. Annual Bonus Plan (the "ABP"). The ABP is a cash-based annual incentive plan in which eligible employees, including our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"), may participate.
Annual cash incentive payments pursuant to the ABP for employees directly supporting our operating segments (including some of our executive officers) will be determined through a combination of Company performance (weighted at 20%), operating segment and/or brand performance (weighted at 50%) and individual performance (weighted at 30%). Annual cash incentive payments pursuant to the ABP for other employees (including our current NEOs) will be determined through a combination of Company performance (weighted at 70%) and individual performance (weighted at 30%).
The Company performance component under the ABP will be based on the following financial metrics: Adjusted OIBDA, Free Cash Flow, Revenues Net of Traffic Acquisition Costs ("TAC") and Adjusted Earnings Per Share as such terms are defined in the ABP.
The operating segment and/or brand performance component under the ABP will be based on a combination of financial and operational metrics, including but not limited to the following: Adjusted OIBDA, revenue net of TAC, revenue net of TAC margin, search revenue, number of full time employees, domestic churn rate, domestic average monthly revenue per AOL-brand access subscriber, subscriptions, unique visitors and external entries as such terms are defined in the ABP.
Additionally, the individual performance component of the ABP is based on the Company employee's overall performance rating in his or her annual review. Company employees, including our NEOs, are eligible to receive additional discretionary cash or equity awards for individual performance from time to time.
The foregoing summary of the ABP is qualified in its entirety and is subject to the terms of the ABP which the Company currently expects to file as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013.
2013 Segment Performance Share Unit Program
On March 27, 2013, the Compensation Committee approved the material terms of the 2013 Segment Performance Share Unit Program ("SPSU"). The SPSU is an annual incentive program in which employees directly supporting our operating segments and/or brands, including certain of our executive officers, may participate. At inception, each SPSU participant is initially allocated a target amount of performance units. Upon the achievement of certain financial and operational targets of an operating segment and/or brand, each SPSU participant may earn a number of performance units either greater than or less than the target allocation amount. Performance units under the SPSU may only be earned if the Company performance thresholds under the ABP have been met and the operating segment and/or brand has achieved at least 100% of its financial and operational targets under the ABP. The maximum amount of performance units that can be earned by a SPSU participant may not be greater than 300% of the participant's target SPSU award. Performance units earned by a participant under the SPSU will vest in two equal installments on each of the first and second anniversaries of the date on which the performance units are deemed earned under the SPSU, subject to the participant's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Each performance unit may be settled in shares of Company stock or in cash, at the Company's sole discretion.
The foregoing summary of the SPSU is qualified in its entirety and is subject to the terms of the SPSU which the Company currently expects to file as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013.
 
Item 8.01. Other Information
Effective April 1, 2013 the Board appointed Hugh Johnston, a current member of the Audit and Finance Committee, to serve as the Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee. In addition, the Board appointed Dawn Lepore, a current member of the Transactions Committee of the Board, to serve as a member of the Audit and Finance Committee effective April 1, 2013. Fredric Reynolds, the Company's Lead Independent Director and former Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee, will step down from the Audit and Finance Committee immediately following the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 3, 2013.

Exhibit 99.1
- AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) released first quarter 2013 results today.
NEW YORK  May 8, 2013
"Growth continues at AOL," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO. "AOL's strategy of being the first scaled media and technology company is clearly represented in our results today, and we will continue to aggressively drive the company toward near- and long-term growth."
 
 
 
Consolidated Revenue Trends:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Profitability Trends:
 
 
 
Asset, Cash & Cash Flow Trends:
 
 
 
Our segments are defined by the products and services they provide and by how we evaluate our business. The following are AOL's reportable segments:
 
 
 
Additionally, AOL has a corporate and other category that includes activities that are not directly attributable or allocable to a specific segment. This category primarily consists of costs associated with broad corporate functions including legal, human resources, finance and accounting, and activities not directly attributable to a segment such as tax settlements and other general business costs.
The following table highlights the significant products or services included in each segment:
 
 
 
Brand Group
Brand Group revenue reflects global display revenue growth and continued growth in search revenue. Brand Group display revenue grew globally driven by an increase in Brand Group inventory sold, including video inventory, and increased pricing of reserved inventory. Under our segment reporting structure, Brand Group inventory sold through AOL Networks is recognized in AOL Networks with a corresponding intersegment TAC charge. An amount equal to the TAC charge, reflecting the revenue net of the margin retained by AOL Networks, is then reflected as intersegment revenue within the Brand Group. Search revenue grew 16% year-over-year driven by marketing related efforts and continued growth in revenue per search on AOL.com. Search revenue growth on AOL.com more than offset a decline in queries from cobranded portals.
Brand Group Adjusted OIBDA improved significantly versus the prior year period, primarily due to the growth in search and display revenue discussed above partially offset by increased TAC as a result of our marketing-related initiatives on search. While significantly improved, Brand Group Adjusted OIBDA remains negative reflecting our investment in Patch and in our editorial staff and sales force domestically and internationally.
Membership Group
Membership Group revenue reflects a 9% decline in subscription revenue driven by 15% fewer domestic AOL-brand access subscribers year-over-year. Subscription revenue year-over-year declines remained near multi-year lows due to a continued historically low churn rate of 1.9% and 7% year-over-year growth in domestic average access subscription monthly revenue per AOL-brand access subscriber (ARPU). ARPU growth reflects continued improvement in our retention efforts and the impact of a price rationalization program. Membership Group revenue declines also reflect lower advertising revenue due to fewer reserved impressions sold, primarily on AOL Mail, and a shift in the sale of those impressions to Advertising.com. As is the case in the Brand Group, this revenue is recognized net of the margin retained by AOL Networks. Membership Group advertising revenue declines also reflect fewer search queries due to the aforementioned decline in subscribers.
 
Membership Group Adjusted OIBDA declines primarily reflect the decline in subscribers during the quarter.
AOL Networks
AOL Networks revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven by 10% growth in Third Party Network revenue. Third Party Network revenue reflects revenue from the sale of inventory from third party properties through Advertising.com and its growth continues to be driven by an increasing number of publishers and advertisers on the network as well as increased sales of premium packages and products including video.
AOL Networks Adjusted OIBDA decreased year-over-year due to higher research and product development costs primarily related to continued investment in Adlearn Open Platform (our demand-side platform) and the launch of AdTech MARKETPLACE (our sell-side platform). AOL Networks-related TAC increased by 11%, slightly faster than Third Party Network revenue due to a shift in the product mix, including growth from the lower margin Buysight offering which AOL acquired in December 2012.
Corporate & Other
Corporate & Other Adjusted OIBDA improved significantly year-over-year primarily due to a $16.1 million decline in costs, which included reductions in corporate personnel and personnel-related expenses, lower marketing related expenses, and a favorable impact resulting from two different sales and use tax matters, one of which impacted Q1 2012 and the other was resolved in Q113.
Tax
AOL had Q1 2013 pre-tax income of $47.1 million and income tax expense of $21.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 45.6%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 47.2% for Q1 2012. The effective tax rate for Q1 2013 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the impact of foreign losses that did not produce a tax benefit. The effective tax rate for Q1 2012 differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate due to the impact of foreign losses that did not produce a benefit and a change in state tax rates.
Cash Flow
Q1 2013 cash provided by operating activities was $40.6 million, while Free Cash Flow was $9.8 million, both up year-over-year driven mainly by the growth in operating income, lower deferred compensation payments in 2013 and the timing of receipt of a significant prepayment from a large partner, where in the prior year, the second quarter prepayment was received early in the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by higher employee bonus payments in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 and timing of payments for certain marketing and legal payments.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and its attachments include the financial measures Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow, both of which are defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These measures may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:
We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, noncash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets, noncash asset impairments and write-offs and special items. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of noncash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings, gains and losses on asset sales and special items, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales, impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets or special items which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Adjusted OIBDA
.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, capitalized product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows.
Free Cash Flow.
Unique Visitor Metrics
We utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the performance of AOL Properties. In addition, we utilize unique visitor numbers to evaluate the reach of the AOL Advertising Network, which includes both AOL Properties and the Third Party Network. Unique visitor numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not correlate directly to advertising revenue, we believe that our ability to broadly reach diverse demographic and geographic audiences is attractive to brand advertisers seeking to promote their brands to a variety of consumers without having to partner with multiple content providers. The source for our unique visitor information is a third party (comScore Media Metrix, or "Media Metrix"). While we are familiar with the general methodologies and processes that Media Metrix uses in estimating unique visitors, we have not performed independent testing or validation of Media Metrix's data collection systems or proprietary statistical models, and therefore we can provide no assurance as to the accuracy of the information that Media Metrix provides.
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and our conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial and operational performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "will," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the "Risk Factors" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the "Annual Report"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we operate a web services company in a highly competitive, rapidly changing and consumer- and technology-driven industry. This industry is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services, technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the continued ability to protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. Achieving our business and financial objectives, including improved financial results and maintenance of a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, could be adversely affected by the factors discussed or referenced under the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Annual Report as well as, among other things: 1) changes in our plans, strategies and intentions; 2) market price volatility; 3) the impact of significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions; 4) our ability to attract and retain key employees; 5) any negative unintended consequences of cost reductions, restructuring actions or similar efforts, including with respect to any associated savings, charges or other amounts; 6) market adoption of new products and services; 7) our ability to attract and retain unique visitors to our properties; 8) asset impairments; and 9) the impact of "cyber-warfare."

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
We use advertising revenue net of TAC, among other measures, to evaluate the financial performance of our business. TAC consists of costs incurred through arrangements in which we acquire third-party online advertising inventory for resale and arrangements whereby partners distribute our free products or services or otherwise direct traffic to AOL Properties. We believe that this definition enhances the comparability of our advertising revenues to the advertising revenues of certain of our competitors. However, comparable activity may be measured differently by other companies and our revenue sources and TAC may be different than those of our competitors. Therefore, our metrics involving TAC may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors.
We use Adjusted OIBDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of restructuring costs, non-cash equity-based compensation, gains and losses on all disposals of assets, non-cash asset impairments and write-offs and special items. We consider Adjusted OIBDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations, asset impairments and write-offs, as well as the effect of restructurings, gains and losses on asset sales and special items, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude the impacts of equity-based compensation to allow us to be more closely aligned with the industry and analyst community.
A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business or the current or future expected cash expenditures for restructuring costs. The Adjusted OIBDA measure also does not include equity-based compensation, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term compensation package. Moreover, the Adjusted OIBDA measures do not reflect gains and losses on asset sales, impairment charges and write-offs related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets or special items which impact our operating performance. We evaluate the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the continuing business that, after capital expenditures and product development costs and principal payments on capital leases, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation on the use of this metric is that Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period because it excludes certain non-operating cash flows and the results of discontinued operations.
We define Cash Net of Debt as cash and equivalents less short- and long-term debt and other financing obligations. We consider Cash Net of Debt to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about our ability to repay debt should it come due immediately. A limitation on the use of this metric is that it does not factor in the other uses of cash or the ability to use other assets in the repayment of debt.
