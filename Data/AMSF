Exhibit 99.1
        
 
     DeRidder, LA  February 28, 2006  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
     Gross written premiums in the fourth quarter were $59.7 million, an increase of 17.7% over gross written premiums of $50.7 million in the 2004 fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $73.2 million, a 9.3% increase over revenues of $67.0 million in the prior year period. Investment income increased to $4.9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.6 million in the same period last year. Net income in the fourth quarter was $5.4 million compared to net income of $3.8 million in the 2004 fourth quarter, an increase of 41.8%.
     In 2005, gross written premiums were $290.9 million compared to $265.0 million in 2004, an increase of $25.9 million or 9.8%. For the full year, revenues were $276.3 million, a $27.3 million or 11.0% increase over 2004 revenues. Net investment income for 2005 was $16.9 million, a 38.2% increase over net investment income of $12.2 million in 2004. Net income of $5.9 million was reported for 2005 compared to net income of $10.6 million in the prior year. In the first half of 2005, AMERISAFE recorded pre-tax loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) of $8.7 million for claims occurring in prior years, and $13.2 million relating to the commutation of reinsurance contracts with Converium Reinsurance (North America). In 2004, AMERISAFE recorded pre-tax loss and LAE of $13.4 million for claims occurring in prior years.
 
     In anticipation of its initial public offering, AMERISAFE effected a 72-for-one reverse stock split effective as of October 27, 2005, reducing the number of then-outstanding shares of common stock to 299,774 shares. On November 23, 2005, AMERISAFE completed its initial public offering, issuing 8.0 million shares of its common stock at $9.00 per share. Upon completion of the IPO, holders of AMERISAFE's Series A preferred stock exchanged the outstanding shares of this series of preferred stock for 9.1 million shares of common stock. As a result of the exchange of Series A preferred stock for shares of our common stock, under the terms of our articles of incorporation, holders of our outstanding convertible preferred stock are no longer entitled to receive dividends. At December 31, 2005, there were 17.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.
     In the fourth quarter of 2005, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.39, compared to $3.83 in the same period of 2004. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2005 were 7,699,752 shares compared to 299,774 shares in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $(1.25), compared to $2.14 in 2004. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2005 were 2,129,492 shares compared to 255,280 shares in 2004. Diluted EPS allocable to common shareholders include the effects of preferred stock dividends of $1.5 million and $2.3 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and $8.6 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. As noted above, AMERISAFE's obligation to pay preferred stock dividends terminated upon completion of the initial public offering. The issuance of 17.1 million shares of common stock in November 2005 (and the resulting calculation of weighted average shares outstanding) and the elimination of the obligation to pay preferred stock dividends will impact period-to-period comparisons of our reported earnings per share in the next four quarters.
Outlook
     Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "During 2005 we took significant steps to support our future growth by reducing our reinsurance recoverables, strengthening our loss reserves, improving our balance sheet and completing our initial public offering. At the same time, we continued to increase revenues and cash flow in 2005. Based on these accomplishments, A.M. Best affirmed our financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) in the fourth quarter."
 
     Presently, the Company expects gross premiums written in 2006 of between $317 million and $325 million, a combined ratio of less than 96%, and a return on average equity of approximately 15%. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

     On May 9, 2006, AMERISAFE, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
     DeRidder, LA  May 9, 2006  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
     Gross premiums written in the first quarter totaled $80.8 million, an increase of 12.9 percent over gross premiums written of $71.6 million for the first quarter of 2005. First quarter revenues totaled $75.2 million, a 13.8 percent increase over revenues of $66.0 million in the prior year period. Net investment income increased to $6.0 million in the first quarter, from $3.7 million for the same period last year.
     Net income in the first quarter was $7.2 million compared to net income of $3.2 million in the 2005 first quarter, an increase of 124 percent. Net income includes realized capital gains of $1.2 million (before tax) in the first quarter of 2006 and $0.2 million (before tax) in the first quarter of 2005. The Company's return on average equity for the first quarter of 2006 was 19.1%, compared to 14.3% for the same period in 2005.
     In anticipation of its initial public offering, AMERISAFE effected a 72-for-one reverse stock split effective as of October 27, 2005, reducing the number of then-outstanding shares of common stock to 299,774 shares. On November 23, 2005, AMERISAFE completed its initial public offering, issuing 8.0 million shares of its common stock at $9.00 per share. Upon completion of the IPO, holders of AMERISAFE's Series A preferred stock exchanged the outstanding shares of this series of preferred stock for 9.1 million shares of common stock. As a result of the exchange of Series A preferred stock for shares of the Company's common stock, under the terms of our articles of incorporation, holders of the Company's outstanding convertible preferred stock are no longer entitled to receive dividends. At March 31, 2006, there were 17.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.
     In the first quarter of 2006, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.36, compared to $2.27 in the same period of 2005. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2006 were 17,607,277 shares compared to 299,774 shares in the first quarter of 2005. The issuance of 17.1 million shares of common stock in November 2005 (and the resulting calculation of weighted average shares outstanding) and the elimination
 
of the obligation to pay preferred stock dividends will impact period-to-period comparisons of our reported earnings per share for the remainder of 2006.
     The net combined ratio for the first quarter of 2006 was 95.0% compared to 98.6% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the first quarter of 2006 totaled $47.9 million, or 70.5% of net premiums earned, compared to $45.9 million, or 74.2% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. Total underwriting expenses for the first quarter were $16.4 million, or 24.2% of net premiums earned, compared to $15.0 million, or 24.1% of net premiums earned, for the first quarter 2005. Underwriting expenses for the 2006 period were offset by $0.9 million for the Company's loss-based assessments accrual, due to the reduction of the 2005 assessment rate from the South Carolina Second Injury Fund.
     Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We continued to experience healthy revenue growth during the first quarter of 2006. Net premiums earned exceeded our expectations in the first quarter and net investment income continued to grow in line with our substantial increase in invested assets. In the quarter, average loss severities were down, we recorded no adverse prior year loss development, and our pricing levels held steady. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and believe we are on track to meet our financial objectives for the year."
2006 Outlook
     The Company is reaffirming its guidance for the full year and presently expects gross premiums written of between $317 million and $325 million, an increase of between 9% and 12% over 2005 gross premiums written, a combined ratio of less than 96 percent, and a return on average equity of approximately 15 percent. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

The issuance of 17.1 million shares of common stock in November 2005 (and the resulting calculation of weighted average shares outstanding) and the elimination of the obligation to pay preferred stock dividends will impact period-to-period comparisons of our reported earnings per share for the remainder of 2006.
     The net combined ratio for the second quarter of 2006 was 95.2% compared to 125.7% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the second quarter of 2006 totaled $50.4 million, or 69.9% of net premiums earned, compared to $64.5 million, or 102.2% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. Total underwriting expenses, including commissions and salaries and benefits, for the second quarter were $18.1 million, or 25.1% of net premiums earned, compared to $14.6 million, or 23.2% of net premiums earned, for the second quarter of 2005.
     The net combined ratio for the first half of 2006 was 95.1% compared to 112.2% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the first half of 2006 totaled $98.2 million, or 70.2% of net premiums earned, compared to $110.4 million, or 88.3% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. Total underwriting expenses, including commissions and salaries and benefits, for the first half of 2006 were $34.5 million, or 24.7% of net premiums earned, compared to $29.6 million, or 23.6% of net premiums earned, for the first half of 2005.
     Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter and first half of the year. We continue to grow our top line while maintaining our pricing, and we have had significant increases in both our invested asset base and net investment income. At the same time, the second quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter in which we experienced no prior year loss development. I believe that we are on target to meet the financial objectives we set for 2006, including growth in gross premiums written, combined ratio and return on shareholders' equity."
 
2006 Outlook
     The Company is reaffirming its guidance for the full year and presently expects gross premiums written of between $317 million and $325 million, a combined ratio of less than 96 percent, and a return on average equity of approximately 15 percent. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On September 6, 2006, AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") announced that Arthur L. Hunt, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, will retire effective November 30, 2006. The Company will divide Mr. Hunt's duties into two separate senior positions, which will be filled by David O. Narigon as the Company's Executive Vice President, effective as of September 1, 2006, and Todd Walker as the Company's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, effective as of September 25, 2006.
     From March 2005 until joining the Company, Mr. Narigon, age 53, provided consulting, mediation, arbitration and expert witness services to the insurance industry through his company, Narigon Consulting & Settlement Services.

Mr. Walker will serve as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company.
     The Company has entered into an employment agreement with each of Mr. Narigon and Mr. Walker. Each agreement has an initial three-year term.

The agreements provide for an annual base salary of no less than $185,000 for Mr. Narigon and $175,000 for Mr. Walker. Each of these executives is also entitled to receive an annual bonus in an amount, if any, determined by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. Each of Mr. Narigon and Mr. Walker may participate in present and future benefit plans that are provided to the Company's executive officers from time to time.
     In connection with his employment, the Company granted Mr. Narigon options to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on September 1, 2006. The Company will grant Mr. Walker options to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock on September 25, 2006, at a per-share exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on that date.
     If the Company terminates the employment of Mr. Narigon or Mr. Walker without cause, as defined in the employment agreements, the terminated executive officer will be entitled to receive his base salary for a period of 12 months payable in regular installments after the date of his termination.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: October 31, 2006

 
Exhibit 99.1
     DeRidder, LA  October 31, 2006  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF) today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
     Gross premiums written in the third quarter totaled $83.0 million, an increase of 17.4 percent over gross premiums written of $70.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter revenues totaled $81.8 million, an 18.0 percent increase over revenues of $69.4 million in the prior year period. Net investment income increased to $6.3 million in the third quarter from $4.3 million for the same period last year.
     Net income in the third quarter was $8.3 million compared to $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net income included realized capital gains of $346,000 (before tax) in the third quarter of 2006 and $563,000 (before tax) in the third quarter of 2005.
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, gross premiums written totaled $255.9 million, a 10.7 percent increase over gross premiums written of $231.2 million for the same period in 2005. Year to date 2006 revenues totaled $236.2 million, a 16.3 percent increase over revenues of $203.1 million in the same period last year. Net investment income increased to $18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from $12.0 million in the same period in 2005.
 
     Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $23.3 million compared to $526,000 for the same period in 2005. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, AMERISAFE recorded pre-tax loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) of $8.7 million for claims occurring in prior years and a pre-tax loss of $13.2 million related to the commutation of reinsurance contracts with Converium Reinsurance (North America). There were no prior year loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 included realized capital gains of $2.6 million (before tax) compared to $1.3 million (before tax) for the same period in 2005.
     In anticipation of its initial public offering, AMERISAFE effected a 72-for-one reverse stock split effective as of October 27, 2005, reducing the number of then-outstanding shares of common stock to 299,774 shares. On November 23, 2005, AMERISAFE completed its initial public offering, issuing 8.0 million shares of its common stock at $9.00 per share. Upon completion of the IPO, holders of AMERISAFE's Series A preferred stock exchanged the outstanding shares of this series of preferred stock for 9.1 million shares of common stock. As a result of the exchange of Series A preferred stock for shares of the Company's common stock, under the terms of our articles of incorporation, holders of the Company's outstanding convertible preferred stock are no longer entitled to receive dividends. At September 30, 2006, there were 17.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.
     In the third quarter of 2006, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.42 compared to $6.05 in the same period of 2005. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2006 were 17,432,597 shares compared to 299,774 shares in the third quarter of 2005. For the first nine months of 2006, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $1.17 compared to $(22.07) in the same period of 2005. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first nine months of 2006 were 17,431,263 compared to 299,774 shares in the first nine months of 2005. The issuance of 17.1 million shares of common stock in November 2005 (and the resulting calculation of weighted average shares outstanding) and the elimination of the obligation to pay preferred stock dividends will impact period-to-period comparisons of the Company's reported earnings per share for the remainder of 2006.
 
     The net combined ratio for the third quarter of 2006 was 93.6% compared to 96.5% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the third quarter of 2006 totaled $51.7 million, or 69.0% of net premiums earned, compared to $45.2 million, or 70.2% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. Total underwriting expenses, including commissions and salaries and benefits, for the third quarter were $18.2 million, or 24.3% of net premiums earned, compared to $16.8 million, or 26.2% of net premiums earned, for the third quarter of 2005.
     The net combined ratio for the first nine months of 2006 was 94.6% compared to 106.9% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the first nine months of 2006 totaled $150.0 million, or 69.8% of net premiums earned, compared to $155.6 million, or 82.2% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. Total underwriting expenses, including commissions and salaries and benefits, for the first nine months of 2006 were $52.7 million, or 24.5% of net premiums earned, compared to $46.4 million, or 24.5% of net premiums earned, for the same period in 2005.
     Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are extremely pleased with our third quarter and year to date financial performance. We experienced healthy top line growth with very strong earnings. In the quarter, we also saw the benefit of our expense management efforts and continuing growth in our invested asset base. Additionally, we continue to see favorable trends in our current accident year losses through September 30, 2006. This is the fifth consecutive quarter in which we experienced no adverse prior year loss development, which is a reflection of our rigorous underwriting, proactive safety reviews and intense claims management practices."
 
2006 Outlook
     The Company is updating guidance for 2006. We presently expect gross premiums written for the full year at the upper end of the range from the earlier guidance of between $317 million and $325 million. Absent any extraordinary loss occurrence or occurrences in the balance of the year, the Company presently expects, for the full year, a combined ratio of 95% or better and a return on average equity of 19% or better. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing annualized net income by the average of shareholders' equity, including redeemable preferred stock, for the applicable period. For clarification, our calculation of return on equity includes net realized gains on investments. Our overall financial objective is to produce a return on equity of at least 15% over the long term.
Conference Call Information
     AMERISAFE has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow, Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at 10:00 a.m. eastern time to discuss the Company's results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 and to comment on management's outlook for future periods.

Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 were net realized gains of $4.8 million, compared to $935,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005.
     For the year ended December 31, 2006, gross premiums written totaled $332.5 million, a 14.3% increase over gross premiums written of $290.9 million in 2005.

     The following events impacted AMERISAFE's 2006 fourth quarter and year end results:
     In anticipation of its initial public offering, AMERISAFE effected a 72-for-one reverse stock split effective as of October 27, 2005, reducing the number of then-outstanding shares of common stock to 299,774 shares. On November 23, 2005, AMERISAFE completed its initial public offering, issuing 8.0 million shares of its common stock at $9.00 per share. Upon completion of the IPO, holders of AMERISAFE's Series A preferred stock exchanged the outstanding shares of this series of preferred stock for 9.1 million shares of common stock. As a result of the exchange of Series A preferred stock for shares of the Company's common stock, under the terms of AMERISAFE's articles of incorporation, holders of the Company's outstanding convertible preferred stock are no longer entitled to receive dividends. At December 31, 2006, there were 18,705,098 shares of common stock outstanding, including 1,214,771 common shares issued upon conversion of 250,000 shares of Series C preferred stock immediately prior to the completion of our secondary offering on November 21, 2006.
 
     In the fourth quarter of 2006, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.70 compared to $0.39 in the same period of 2005. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 18,138,866 shares compared to 7,669,752 shares in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year 2006, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $1.88 compared to $(1.25) in 2005. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2006 were 17,594,736 compared to 2,129,492 shares in 2005.
     The net combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 87.1% compared to 96.7% for the same period in 2005. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 totaled $49.5 million, or 58.7% of net premiums earned, compared to $48.4 million, or 72.1% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2005. The decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2006 was the result of decrease in the current accident year loss ratio, from 71.0% in 2005 to 67.3% in 2006, and $2.2 million of favorable prior year loss development discussed above. Total underwriting expenses, including commissions and salaries and benefits, for the fourth quarter were $18.5 million, or 22.0% of net premiums earned, compared to $17.0 million, or 25.3% of net premiums earned, for the fourth quarter of 2005.

     Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are extremely pleased with our 2006 results. Strong top line growth combined with excellent underwriting results and steady returns on our growing invested asset base contributed to record earnings in 2006. We benefited from favorable prior year loss development as well as decreased frequency of severe claims in 2006 compared to prior years, resulting in a significantly lower net loss ratio. At the same time, we continue to prudently reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses.
 
     "We also continued our aggressive management of expenses, recording lower expense ratios for both the fourth quarter and the full year, in spite of the expenses we incurred related to the secondary offering in the fourth quarter. We did experience an increase in our dividend ratio as a result of the dividend accrual required in Florida. However, based on the nature of the accrual and our underwriting results in Florida during the past two years, we do not anticipate that we will need to accrue dividends under the Florida statute in 2007.
     "Finally, in 2006 we generated a return on average shareholders' equity of 22.6%, which further confirms the strategic advantage of our niche focus on high hazard classes. We are confident that our strategic focus will provide opportunities to further increase revenues and net income, and produce attractive returns for our shareholders in 2007," concluded Bradley.
     
Outlook
     AMERISAFE expects gross premiums written for 2007 to range between $350 million and $360 million, representing 7-10% growth over 2006 results, not including the effect of EBUB premiums recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company also expects a combined ratio of 95% or better and a return on average equity of 16% or better in 2007. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing annualized net income by the average of shareholders' equity, including redeemable preferred stock, for the applicable period. AMERISAFE's long-term financial objective is to produce a return on equity of at least 15%.

We continue to generate strong returns as evidenced by our return on equity of 22.4% and a combined ratio of 89.2% for the quarter. Our performance through nine months has prompted us to revise our 2007 outlook to a return on average equity of greater than 20% and a combined ratio of 91% or lower.
"We continue to focus on underwriting profitability throughout all market cycles. Three key factors impacting our gross premiums written are 1) lower adopted loss costs and rates in various states, 2) our dedication to underwriting and pricing discipline, and 3) a slowing national economy. As a result of these factors, we are revising 2007 outlook for gross premiums written for the year to between $328 million and $338 million. We believe that disciplined underwriting and adequate pricing in the current market is the right approach for the company and our shareholders. We are focused on our sales and marketing efforts to take advantage of our geographic reach to write business in those industries and states that offer the best opportunity to maximize our returns."
2007 Outlook
For the full year 2007, the Company currently expects gross premiums written of between $328 million and $338 million, a combined ratio of 91% or lower and a return on average equity of greater than 20%. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DERIDDER, LA., February 7, 2008  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of high hazard workers' compensation insurance, today announced preliminary unaudited results for 2007.
For the full year 2007, the Company currently expects gross premiums written of approximately $328 million, a combined ratio of approximately 86% and a return on average equity of approximately 24%. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.
These preliminary year end results include favorable prior year loss development of approximately $9.5 million, recorded in the 2007 fourth quarter as a reduction to loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred.
At December 31, 2007, the Company's total investment portfolio, including cash and classified cash equivalents, was $759 million. Of this amount, $640 million are fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity. The Company regularly reviews the fair value of its investments to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of its investments. Based on the information currently available to management, the Company does not expect to report an impairment loss in the 2007 fourth quarter relating to its investment portfolio. All securities in AMERISAFE's investment portfolio are presently current with regard to principal, dividend, and interest payments.
Given the events in the subprime mortgage market that began late last spring and the related, more recent announcements regarding companies that provide bond insurance, management is actively monitoring and evaluating the Company's insured municipal bond portfolio and the underlying credit quality of these bonds, as well as those municipal bonds which do not have insurance. Additional information regarding the credit quality of AMERISAFE's entire municipal bond portfolio is included in the annex to this release.
 
Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are very pleased with these preliminary results, in particular our expected loss ratio for the year. Gross premiums written, year over year, were essentially flat, due to both lower rates in a number of states and increased competition, which we expect will continue into 2008. We remain committed to maintaining pricing discipline in order to earn a reasonable underwriting profit, further improving our risk selection and providing superior claims and other services to our insureds and their employees. We look forward to issuing final results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 later this month."

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 12, 2008, AMERISAFE, Inc. ("Amerisafe") received executed agreements creating a new excess of loss reinsurance treaty program related to its voluntary and assigned risk business that applies to losses incurred between January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2011 for the first layer of coverage under this program and between January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009 for the second, third, and fourth layers of coverage under this program. Amerisafe's reinsurance treaty program provides it with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to $50.0 million, subject to applicable deductibles, retentions, and aggregate limits. However, for any loss occurrence involving only one claimant, Amerisafe's reinsurance coverage is limited to a maximum of $10.0 million for any single claimant, subject to applicable deductibles, retentions, and aggregate limits. Amerisafe currently has 14 reinsurers participating in its 2008 reinsurance treaty program. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of a reinsurer's A.M. Best rating to "B++" (Very Good) or below, Amerisafe may terminate the participation of one or more of its reinsurers, and the terminated reinsurer may be required to provide Amerisafe with security for amounts due under the terms of its reinsurance program. This security may take the form of, among other things, cash advances into a trust fund or the issuance of letters of credit to Amerisafe.
Amerisafe's 2008 reinsurance treaty program provides coverage in the following four layers:
 
 
 
 
The agreement for both parts of the first layer will terminate on January 1, 2011, and the agreements for the second, third and fourth layers of coverage will terminate on January 1, 2009.
At Amerisafe's option, it has the right to commute the reinsurers' obligations under the agreement for the first layer of coverage at any time after the end of the term of the agreement. If Amerisafe commutes the reinsurers' obligations, it is entitled to receive a portion of the premiums that were paid to the reinsurers prior to the effective date of the commutation, subject to certain adjustments provided in the agreement.
 
The table below sets forth the reinsurers participating in our 2008 reinsurance program
:
 
 
The foregoing description of the 2008 reinsurance treaty program is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the reinsurance agreements, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, and incorporated herein by reference.

FUNDS WITHHELD ACCOUNT
At the subscribing reinsurer's option, the Company shall retain any and all Reinsurance Premiums due hereunder on a Funds Withheld basis, provided however that payment of the subscribing reinsurer's fixed expenses at a rate of 14% of the Reinsurance Premium net of the applicable Ceding Commission shall be paid in cash to the subscribing reinsurer at such time as the respective Reinsurance Premiums are due and shall not be affected by the terms of this FUNDS WITHHELD ACCOUNT ARTICLE.
In consideration of the subscribing reinsurer choosing this Funds Withheld option, the Company agrees (i) to calculate a Notional Funds Withheld Account Balance from the inception of this Contract until there is a complete and final release of all of the Reinsurer's obligations to the Reinsured under this Contract and (ii) that the Notional Funds Withheld Account Balance (as defined below) may be offset by the Reinsurer against liability of any nature whatsoever (whether then contingent, due and payable, or in the future becoming due) that it may then have, or in the future may have, under this Contract and (iii) such offset shall occur as a condition precedent to any payments by the Reinsurer hereunder.
As of the close of each calendar quarter, and at any other time as required, the Company shall calculate the balance of the Notional Funds Withheld Account as follows:

All loss settlements made by the Company that are within the terms and conditions of this Contract (including but not limited to ex gratia payments) shall be binding upon the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer agrees to pay all amounts for which it may be liable upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the amount paid by the Company. Upon receipt of the Summary Report as described below in the REPORTS AND REMITTANCES ARTICLE, the Reinsurer agrees to promptly pay or allow, as the case may be, its share of each such settlement in accordance with this Contract.
LIABILITY OF REINSURERS
All reinsurances for which the Reinsurer shall be liable by virtue of this Contract shall be subject in all respects to the same rates, terms, conditions, interpretations and waivers and to the same
 
modifications, alterations, and cancellations, as the respective policies to which such reinsurances relate, the true intent of the parties to this Contract being that the Reinsurer shall follow the fortunes of the Company.
LATE PAYMENTS
(The provisions of this article shall not be implemented unless specifically invoked, in writing, by one of the parties to the Contract)

If the Reinsurer disputes the Commutation Settlement Amount established by the Company under this paragraph E, then such dispute shall be settled by a panel of three actuaries, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an actuary within 30 days, the other party may appoint two actuaries. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the selection of a third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall name two, of whom the other shall decline one and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. All the actuaries shall be Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society or members of the American Academy of Actuaries. All of the actuaries shall be independent of either party to this Contract. Each party shall bear the cost of their appointed actuary (or actuary appointed for them if they fail to make a timely appointment) and shall share the cost evenly of the third actuary.
The settlement agreed upon by a majority of the panel of actuaries shall be final and binding on both parties and set forth in a sworn written document expressing their professional opinion that said value is fair for the complete mutual release of all liabilities in respect of such reserves.

No liability shall attach hereunder for any claim or claims not reported to the Reinsurer within this 7-year period. If a loss arising out of a Loss Occurrence is reported during this period, all losses arising out of the same Loss Occurrence shall be deemed reported under this paragraph regardless of when notification of loss is provided.
If the Notional Experience Account balance is positive and the Company does not commute this Contract on or before December 31, 2017, the Company shall pay to the Reinsurer in cash each January 1, beginning January 1, 2018, an annual charge equal 200 basis points times the then current balance in the Notional Experience Account.
 
SUBROGATION
The Reinsurer shall be credited with subrogation or salvage recoveries (i.e., reimbursement obtained or recovery made by the Company, less Loss Adjustment Expense incurred in obtaining such reimbursement or making such recovery) on account of claims and settlements involving reinsurance hereunder. Subrogation or salvage recoveries thereon shall always be used to reimburse the excess carriers in the reverse order of their priority according to their participation before being used in any way to reimburse the Company for its primary loss. The Company, at its sole option and discretion, may enforce its rights to subrogation relating to any loss, a part of which loss was sustained by the Reinsurer, and may prosecute all claims arising out of such rights.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
DeRidder, LA  February 27, 2008AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of high hazard workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $18.6 million compared to net income of $14.0 million in the 2006 fourth quarter, an increase of 32.6%. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2007 included realized capital gains of $20,000 and $9.5 million of favorable prior year loss development. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2006 included realized capital gains of $4.8 million and $2.2 million of favorable prior year loss development. Net investment income increased to $7.9 million in the fourth quarter from $7.3 million for the same period last year, an increase of 9.3%. The Company's return on average equity for the 2007 fourth quarter was 33.1% compared to 31.6% for the same period in 2006.
Gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $61.8 million, a decrease of 19.2% compared to $76.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was primarily a result of lower 2007 endorsements and audit premium, when compared to 2006, which the Company attributes to reduced business activity among its insured employers. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $82.4 million, a 14.6% decrease compared to revenues of $96.5 million in the prior year period.
Net income for 2007 was $50.2 million compared to $37.4 million for 2006, an increase of 34.4%. In 2007 on a pre-tax basis, the Company recorded $9.5 million of favorable prior year loss development, income of $3.7 million from reinsurance commutations, and $147,000 of realized capital gains. Pre-tax net income for 2006 included $2.2 million of favorable prior year loss development and realized capital gains of $7.4 million. Net investment income increased to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $25.4 million in 2006, an increase of 19.0%. The Company's return on average equity for the year was 24.1%, compared to 22.6% for 2006.
For the full year ended December 31, 2007, gross premiums written totaled $327.8 million, a 1.4% decrease from gross premiums written of $332.5 million for 2006. Revenues for 2007 totaled $338.3 million, a 1.7% increase over revenues of $332.7 million last year.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.92 compared to $0.70 in the same period of 2006. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 19,067,749 shares compared to 18,138,866 shares in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2007, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $2.47 compared to $1.88 for 2006. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2007 were 19,079,380 shares compared to 17,594,736 shares for 2006.
The net combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 73.0% compared to 87.1% for the same period in 2006. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $37.9 million, or 51.0% of net premiums earned, compared to $49.5 million, or 58.7% of net premiums earned for the same period in 2006. Total underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $17.7 million, or 23.8% of net premiums earned, compared to $18.5 million, or 22.0% of net premiums earned, for the fourth quarter 2006.
The net combined ratio for the full year 2007 was 85.9% compared to 92.4% for 2006. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for 2007 were $198.5 million, or 64.7% of net premiums earned, compared to $199.5 million, or 66.6% of net premiums earned for 2006. Total underwriting expenses were $65.5 million, or 21.3% of net premiums earned for 2007 compared to $71.3 million, or 23.8% of net premiums earned, for 2006. Underwriting expenses for 2007 were reduced by $3.7 million, or 1.2% of net premiums earned, as the result of the reinsurance commutations effected in the 2007 second and third quarters.
At year-end, the Company's investment portfolio, including cash, exceeded $759 million, up $93.5 million from the end of 2006. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers at year-end were $76.9 million, a decrease of $32.7 million from December 31, 2006.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "2007 was a record year for AMERISAFE. We continued to produce high quality business, and losses were significantly lower than expected. In addition, prior year loss development was favorable and our open claims inventory at the end of the year was the lowest in a decade."
"As in 2007, the marketplace continues to be challenging. Lower loss costs have resulted in lower rates in a number of states. We are also experiencing increased competition as some market participants are pricing policies at levels that we do not believe adequately reflect the risk incurred. Compounding these issues is a noted decrease in business activity among our insureds, as measured by reported payrolls. We expect these market conditions to continue through 2008, which will put pressure on our gross premiums written, but we intend to continue to price our policies to earn an acceptable underwriting profit, as we have done in prior years."
2008 Outlook
For the full year 2008, the Company currently expects to produce a combined ratio of 94% or lower and a return on average equity of 15% or greater. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

On February 26, 2008 AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the AMERISAFE, Inc. 2008 Management Annual Incentive Plan (the "Plan") setting out the terms upon which annual incentive bonuses will be awarded to selected managers for performance in 2008 and subsequent years. The Plan, to be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), permits annual incentive bonus awards to be conditioned upon achievement of predetermined operational and strategic performance goals. A manager receiving an award under the Plan must be employed by the Company on the last day of the performance period for which the award is made, provided the Compensation Committee will authorize payment of a prorated amount based on service for a portion of the performance period if employment terminates due to death, disability or retirement. A prorated portion of the target incentive bonus payout for a performance period will also be paid if a change in control of AMERISAFE, Inc. occurs during the performance period. Performance goals may be equitably adjusted by the Compensation Committee during the applicable performance period to reflect extraordinary or unusual circumstances. The foregoing summary information is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Plan, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On February 26, 2008 the Board approved amendments to the AMERISAFE, Inc. Bylaws to permit the issuance of shares of the company's stock in uncertificated electronic form. The amended and restated sections of the AMERISAFE, Inc. Bylaws are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
DeRidder, LA  May 1, 2008 - AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of high hazard workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
Net income in the first quarter was $11.9 million compared to net income of $8.4 million in the 2007 first quarter, an increase of 41.6%. Pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2008 included $1.7 million of favorable prior year loss development. Pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2007 had no prior year loss development. Net investment income increased to $7.8 million in the first quarter from $6.9 million for the same period last year, an increase of 12.9%. The Company's return on average equity for the 2008 first quarter was 20.0% compared to 17.9% for the same period in 2007.
Gross premiums written in the first quarter of 2008 were $81.0 million, a decrease of 10.5%, compared to $90.5 million in the first quarter of 2007. The decrease was the result of lower state-mandated loss costs and increased competition, as well as decreased audit premium from lower than anticipated work activity. First quarter revenues totaled $82.3 million, a decrease of less than 1%, compared to revenues of $82.9 million in the prior year period.
In the first quarter of 2008, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.59 compared to $0.42 in the same period of 2007. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2008 were 19,019,373 shares compared to 18,999,939 shares in the first quarter of 2007.
The net combined ratio for the first quarter of 2008 was 87.1% compared to 92.5% for the same period in 2007. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $49.9 million, or 67.2% of net premiums earned, compared to $52.5 million, or 69.2% of net premiums earned, for the same period in 2007. Total underwriting expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $14.5 million, or 19.5% of net premiums earned, compared to $17.2 million, or 22.6% of net premiums earned, for the first quarter 2007.
At the end of the first quarter of 2008, the Company's investment portfolio, including cash, was $773.9 million, up $14.8 million from the end of 2007. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers at the quarter-end were $72.6 million, a decrease of $4.3 million from December 31, 2007.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Under current market conditions, our financial results were excellent. We continue to produce solid returns, as evidenced by our first quarter return on equity of 20%, combined ratio of 87.1% and net income growth of over 41%.
"Going forward, we will maintain adequate rate levels commensurate with the risks we underwrite. While I expect the rest of 2008 to be quite challenging for the industry, I am confident that we are well positioned in the current market."
2008 Outlook
For the full year 2008, AMERISAFE reaffirms its previously issued guidance. The Company currently expects to produce a combined ratio of 94% or lower and a return on average equity of 15% or greater. AMERISAFE calculates return on average equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders' equity plus redeemable preferred stock.

On June 20, 2008 AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") commuted certain reinsurance agreements with Hannover Ruckversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft ("Hannover"), covering portions of the 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 accident years. Hannover remains obligated to subsidiaries of the Company under other reinsurance agreements.
The commuted agreements afforded coverage (i) in 2003 for portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $2.0 million of each such loss by the Company; (ii) in 2004 for portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $2.0 million of each such loss by the Company; (iii) in 2005 for portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $1.0 million of each such loss by the Company; and (iv) in 2006 for portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $2.0 million of each such loss by the Company. For each year coverage was also subject to applicable aggregate annual deductibles, retentions, and other limitations.
AMERISAFE received cash of approximately $7.5 million in exchange for releasing Hannover from its reinsurance obligations under the commuted agreements and settling the commuted agreements' profit contingency provisions. As a result of the commutation, AMERISAFE will book additional pre-tax income of approximately $991 thousand in the second quarter of 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On July 7, 2008 AMERISAFE, Inc. ("AMERISAFE") commuted certain reinsurance agreements with Partner Reinsurance Company of the U. S. ("Partner Re"), covering portions of the 2005 and 2006 accident years. Partner Re remains obligated to subsidiaries of AMERISAFE under other reinsurance agreements.
The commuted agreements afforded coverage (i) for 2005 of portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $1.0 million of each such loss by AMERISAFE; and (ii) for 2006 of portions of the first $5.0 million of each loss occurrence, subject to the retention of the first $2.0 million of each such loss by AMERISAFE. For each year coverage was also subject to applicable aggregate annual deductibles, retentions, and other limitations.

As a result of the commutation, AMERISAFE will book additional pre-tax income of approximately $703,000 in the third quarter of 2008.

Young (a member of the Board and the Chair of the Board's Audit Committee) had a telephone conference with Mr. Hallagan to discuss in more detail his decision not to stand for re-election to the Board. A representative of the Company's outside counsel also participated in this telephone conference.
During this call, Mr. Hallagan expressed a number of concerns regarding differences of opinion between him and the other Board members regarding the appropriate level of Board oversight of management. Mr. Hallagan's concerns included (a) the accuracy and completeness of the minutes of the August 2008 Investment Committee meeting and the draft minutes of the November 2008 Board meeting; (b) conflicts between Mr. Hallagan and the Company's Chairman and CEO and another member of the Board's Investment Committee regarding the role of the Investment Committee; (c) two Board members who are related; (d) the Company's investment managers and consultants and related matters; (e) management's interaction with the Board in consideration of a possible repurchase of the Company's Series C and D preferred shares; (f) instructions to the Company's CEO to sell shares of the Company's common stock; (g) stock option grant procedures with respect to an option grant to one executive officer and the consideration of book value in relation to the option exercise price; (h) an analysis in a proposal to expand the Company's headquarters' facility; and (i) the composition of the Board.
Following this telephone conference, Mr. Hallagan e-mailed to Mr. Morris, Mr. Young and the representative of the Company's outside counsel a draft memorandum, dated January 14, 2009, outlining the concerns he had expressed in the telephone conference on February 3, 2009. A copy of Mr. Hallagan's February 3, 2009 e-mail and memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit 17.2, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
On February 5, 2009, the Board met to discuss Mr. Hallagan's decision not to stand for re-election and the concerns expressed in Mr. Hallagan's memorandum attached as an exhibit to this report. In particular, Mr. Young asked Mr. Hallagan to address any concerns regarding fraud, as that word is used in his memorandum. Mr. Hallagan responded that his concerns related to the possibility of the occurrence of fraud at the Company. Mr. Hallagan stated that he was not currently aware of any evidence of fraud occurring at any level of the Company, the
 
Board or management. Mr. Young then asked each Board member, as well as each member of the Company's senior management, present at the meeting to confirm whether any of them were currently aware of any evidence of fraud occurring at any level of the Company, the Board or management. Each responded that they were not.
Mr. Young then asked Mr. Hallagan if he would be willing to provide the Board with a letter clarifying his draft memorandum and confirming his earlier statement. He agreed to do so. A copy of Mr. Hallagan's letter, dated February 5, 2009, is attached hereto as Exhibit 17.3, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The Board takes its fiduciary obligations seriously. The Board intends to conduct a corporate governance review to evaluate and address the concerns raised by Mr. Hallagan as well as any related governance issues identified during that process.

Director Re-Election
Subject:
Fellow board members -
You may, or may not, be aware that my director term expires at the 2009 Annual meeting.
The purpose of this note is to let you know that I am choosing not to be considered for re-election. My reason is that I have concerns about governance processes that seem to differ with the board in general.
I wish you all the best in the future oversight of Amerisafe and I look forward to staying in touch from outside the Company after the completion of my term in June.
With best regards
Tom

[The following is the contents of the memorandum attached to Mr. Hallagan's e-mail.]
****
Draft prepared on the date my adjusted minutes e-mail was sent to fellow board members.
Substantially all the issues had been previously addressed with other directors. Held a private conversation with the Audit chair on the phone in January reiterating my concerns.
Memo was not sent because I did not believe I had support or interest from the rest of the board to address the issues substantively. There is simply a style difference among board members view of management oversight that would not shift.
My election given Allen's tight management of the people and processes was to: 1) not seek re-election rather than to try to reorient the group; and 2) inform the audit chair of my concern for fraud or misconduct.
****
January 14, 2009
Gentlemen 
In response to my suggestion for the proposed minute changes today, Todd Walker shot back a four-letter e-mail response that read: "YYYY."
Aside from my surprise at the inappropriateness of Todd's responding, it prompted me to respond further to the fellow board members to the question "Why" I clearly am paying close attention right now.
The short answer is that in the era of rampant fraud in the sub-prime market, Bernie Madoff's fraudulent ponzi scheme, and the worst financial meltdown seen by any of us, I am concerned about functioning at Amerisafe. Since we each have fiduciary duty and personal liability, I am detailing my concerns for you to consider in your own right. Most of these are not new to you, but I wanted to aggregate all of them in writing with the hope that it may spark discussion.
Investment Committee Minutes  August meeting
 
November board minutes accuracy
 
 
Conflict resolution  November meeting
 
Investment Committee Status
 
Father / Son Conflict
 
CIO Firing  April Meeting
 
Stock buy-back  August meeting
 
 
Management's monetization of stock
 
Stock Grants  Sidestepping Governance Process
 
Stock Grants  Number of shares / dollar value of grant
 
 
New Building Expansion  Lack of analysis
 
Equities
 
Conclusion
While it was not at all in Todd's place to respond "Why, Why, Why, Why" the answer is obvious. It is because I believe that we have a great deal of room for important improvement in many areas. Nevertheless, acquiescing to shortcomings exposes each of us to personal liability.
 
All the items above were included to detail for you the facts behind my concern that process is not working well at the company. "The ends justifies the means" (Machiavelli) keeps popping into my head as acceptable behavior. Behavior was so strange that I did vocalize my concern for fraud or misconduct to the audit chairman.
Knowing each of you as I do, I do not believe you find that behavior acceptable. I bring these to your attention in the hopes that we might all discuss if we need a cleaner organization. The path to that end is unclear to me. My observation on the most significant help was the outside consultant that worked with management and their 360 degree reviews last year.
The structure of our board also has a number of concerns for me. All of us except Austin and Shawn fall into some interconnected web. While the web passes SEC muster, I believe that the tightness of that interconnected web may well be getting in the way of impartial board oversight. It is also worth noting that there are the "in-town" and "out of town" board members. I have often wondered how much gets decided by the in-towners before the out of towners arrive.

Attn: Austin P. Young, Audit Committee Chair
Gentlemen:
During the telephonic Board meeting earlier today, we discussed my talking points draft memorandum, dated January 14, 2009, and in particular, my use of the word fraud in that memorandum. My concerns related to the possibility of the occurrence of fraud at the Company.
To clarify my talking points draft memorandum and to confirm my statement during the Board meeting, I am not currently aware of any evidence of fraud occurring at any level of the Company, the Board or management, either related to concerns identified in my memorandum or otherwise.

On February 23, 2009 AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: February 23, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
DeRidder, LA  February 23, 2009  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of high hazard workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.
 
(1) Operating net income and operating return on average equity are non-GAAP financial measures, and management believes that investors' understanding of core operating performance is enhanced by AMERISAFE's disclosure of these financial measures.
 
 
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $5.7 million compared to $18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of 69.2%. Excluding net realized after-tax capital losses and gains, operating net income was $19.1 million compared to $18.6 million in the 2007 fourth quarter, an increase of 2.6%. Please refer to the financial tables above for a reconciliation of operating net income to net income.
Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2008 included $9.3 million of favorable prior year loss development and $2.2 million of Florida policyholder dividend expense. For the same period in 2007, pre-tax income included $9.5 million of favorable prior year loss development. Operating return on average equity for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 27.8% compared to 33.5% for the fourth quarter of 2007. On a reported basis, return on average equity for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 8.4% compared to 33.1% for the fourth quarter of 2007. The fourth quarter 2008 return on average equity was affected by the net realized after-tax capital losses described below.
Net investment income was $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company also recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to the Company's holdings in exchange-traded funds, and $1.2 million of realized losses primarily from the sale of equity securities. The after-tax effect of the impairments and realized losses was $13.4 million for the quarter of 2008.
Gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $65.1 million, an increase of 5.3%, compared to $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was the result of an increase of new and renewal premium coupled with lower audit adjustments for policies written in prior periods. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $64.0 million, a decrease of 22.3%, compared to revenues of $82.4 million in the prior year period. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were impacted by $16.0 million of net realized losses on investments compared to $20,000 of net realized gains on investments for the same quarter in 2007.
Net income for 2008 was $43.8 million compared to $50.2 million for 2007, a decrease of 12.7%. Excluding net realized after-tax capital losses and gains, operating net income for 2008 was $59.1 million compared to $50.1 million, an increase of 17.8%.
For 2008, pre-tax income included $20.4 million of favorable prior year loss development and income of $2.2 million from reinsurance commutations partially offset by Florida policyholder dividend expense of $2.1 million. Pre-tax net income for 2007 included $9.5 million of favorable prior year loss development and income of $3.7 million from reinsurance commutations. Net investment income was $31.0 million for 2008, an increase of
2.6% over the $30.2 million of net investment income recorded in 2007. The Company's return on average equity was 17.1% (23.2% on an operating basis) for 2008, compared to 24.1% (24.4% on an operating basis) for 2007.
For 2008, gross premiums written totaled $307.8 million, a 6.1% decrease from gross premiums written of $327.8 million for 2007. Revenues for 2008 totaled $302.4 million, a 10.6% decrease from revenues of $338.3 million for 2007.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.28 compared to $0.92 in the 2007 fourth quarter. Excluding net realized after-tax capital losses and gains, operating earnings per share were $0.94 compared to $0.92 in the same period in 2007. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled 19,197,815 shares compared to 19,067,749 shares in the fourth quarter of 2007.
For 2008, diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $2.15 compared to $2.47 for 2007. Excluding net realized after-tax capital losses and gains, 2008 operating earnings per share were $2.90 compared to $2.47 for 2007. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2008 totaled 19,141,688 shares compared to 19,079,380 shares for 2007.
The net combined ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 was 73.7% compared to 73.0% for the same period in 2007. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for fourth quarter of 2008 were $37.2 million, or 51.8% of net premiums earned, compared to $37.9 million, or 51.0% of net premiums earned, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Total underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $12.8 million, or 17.8% of net premiums earned, compared to $17.7 million, or 23.8% of net premiums earned, for the fourth quarter of 2007.
The net combined ratio for 2008 was 81.4% compared to 85.9% for 2007. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for 2008 were $176.4 million, or 60.9% of net premiums earned, compared to $198.5 million, or 64.7% of net premiums earned, for 2007. Total underwriting expenses for 2008 were $55.9 million, or 19.3% of net premiums earned, compared to $65.5 million, or 21.3% of net premiums earned, for 2007.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The insurance professionals of AMERISAFE delivered a superior performance in 2008, especially considering market conditions. We maintained the integrity of our risk selection process, managed our expenses carefully and continued our strategy of early claims resolution, all of which resulted in an excellent combined ratio of 81.4% and an operating return on average equity of 23.2%."
2009 Outlook
AMERISAFE's overall financial objective is to produce a return on equity of at least 15% over the long-term while maintaining optimal operating leverage in its insurance subsidiaries that is commensurate with the its A. M. Best rating of "A-" (Excellent). Commenting on 2009, Bradley stated, "The outlook for 2009 remains unclear. On the one hand, there has been significant market disruption and marked capital reduction that should provide AMERISAFE with an opportunity to expand market share. On the other hand, economic conditions will result in lower work activity that will, in turn, suppress premium volume. Which of these opposing forces will prevail is uncertain. What is certain is that AMERISAFE's strong balance sheet and efficient operating platform place us in a solid competitive position in the hazardous workers compensation market."

On March 1, 2010, AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  March 1, 2010 - AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $6.6 million compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 15.0%. Excluding net realized after-tax capital gains and losses, operating net income was $6.6 million compared to $19.1 million in the 2008 fourth quarter.
Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2009 included $8.7 million of favorable prior year loss development. The Company also adjusted the current accident year loss ratio for the full year from 69.0% to 73.8%. For the fourth quarter of 2009, this adjustment resulted in $12.1 million of additional loss and loss adjustment expense related to the current accident year. The current accident year loss ratio adjustment was primarily driven by severe claims occurring in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the same period in 2008, pre-tax income included $9.3 million of favorable prior year loss development and $2.2 million of Florida policyholder dividend expense.
Return on average equity for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 8.5% compared to 8.4% for the fourth quarter of 2008. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company redeemed its Series C and D redeemable preferred shares for $25.9 million. The average equity calculation for both the fourth quarter and full year includes the redeemable preferred stock carrying value of $25.0 million in beginning equity. Operating return on average equity for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 8.5% compared to 27.8% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter 2008 return on average equity was affected by the net realized after-tax capital losses described below.
Gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $49.4 million compared to $65.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a decrease of 24.2%. Voluntary premiums for policies written in the quarter decreased 11.8%, the effect of which was compounded by negative payroll audits and related premium adjustments for policies written in previous quarters.
Net investment income was $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $14.7 million, primarily related to the Company's holdings in exchange-traded funds, and $1.2 million of realized losses primarily from the sale of other equity securities. The after-tax effect of the impairments and realized losses was $13.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.

For 2009, pre-tax income included $21.9 million of favorable prior year development and higher current accident year losses. The Company increased the current accident year loss ratio from 68.0% for 2008 to 73.8% for 2009 due to losses experienced. For 2008, pre-tax income included $20.4 million of favorable prior year loss development partially offset by Florida
policyholder dividend expense of $2.1 million. The Company's return on average equity was 16.0% (15.4% on an operating basis) for 2009, compared to 17.1% (23.2% on an operating basis) for 2008.
For 2009, gross premiums written totaled $256.5 million, a 16.7% decrease from gross premiums written of $307.8 million for 2008. Net investment income was $28.0 million for 2009, a decrease of 9.6% over the $31.0 million of net investment income recorded in 2008. Revenues for 2009 totaled $282.2 million, a 6.7% decrease from revenues of $302.4 million for 2008.
Diluted earnings per share allocable to common shareholders were $0.28 in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding net realized after-tax capital gains and losses, operating earnings per share were $0.32 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $0.94 in the same period in 2008. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled 19,318,883 shares compared to 19,197,815 shares in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The net combined ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was 96.7% compared to 73.7% for the same period in 2008. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for fourth quarter of 2009 were $42.7 million, or 74.9% of net premiums earned, compared to $37.2 million, or 51.8% of net premiums earned for the fourth quarter of 2008. Total underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $12.2 million, or 21.4% of net premiums earned, compared to $12.8 million, or 17.8% of net premiums earned, for the fourth quarter of 2008.
The net combined ratio for 2009 was 86.9% compared to 81.4% for 2008. Loss and loss adjustment expenses for 2009 were $163.3 million, or 65.1% of net premiums earned, compared to $176.4 million, or 60.9% of net premiums earned, for 2008. Total underwriting expenses for 2009 were $54.0 million, or 21.5% of net premiums earned, compared to $55.9 million, or 19.3% of net premiums earned, for 2008.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In terms of loss experience the fourth quarter was disappointing. Yet Amerisafe continues to produce an underwriting profit despite these losses, the protracted soft insurance market cycle and economic pressures on the classes of business we
insure. The AMERISAFE team is committed to operating efficiently throughout cycles and maintaining profitability by appropriate risk selection and effective claims management, as evidenced in our superb combined ratio of 86.9% and return on average equity of 16.0%. Making prudent business decisions in the current market bodes well for our Company's ability to build long-term shareholder value."
Share Repurchase Plan
AMERISAFE also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of the company's common stock. The program will have an authorized limit of up to $25 million and will expire on December 31, 2010.

This stock repurchase program will allow us to leverage that growth to further enhance shareholder value."

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  May 3, 2010AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Although macro-economic factors continue to weigh on results across our industry, AMERISAFE again generated a sound return for shareholders during the first quarter as a result of our commitment to underwriting discipline. Importantly, claims activity was more normalized during the first quarter compared to the spike in large claims we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Bradley noted, "Both the loss and underwriting expense ratios were negatively affected by the decline in earned premiums. Lower loss costs and rates coupled with high unemployment over the last few years have caused the workers' compensation market to significantly contract. However, with broad expectations for a recovery in 2010 and beyond, we anticipate that this trend will start to reverse. Nevertheless, any improvement is likely to be gradual, and competition remains intense in the workers' compensation industry. At AMERISAFE, we stand by our commitment to appropriately select and price our business in order to generate a solid underwriting profit."

DeRidder, LA  August 4, 2010 - AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Industry and economic conditions remain challenging. While the competitive landscape has improved, some aggressive competitors continue to price their products at less than profitable levels even as claims frequency and costs are beginning to increase. At the same time the continued economic doldrums result in reduced payrolls and thus
premiums. Lower approved loss costs in many jurisdictions exacerbate the drop in premium. Even with these compound pressures we've generated a solid return on equity and commensurate growth in book value as we remain committed to underwriting and expense discipline."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "Expense ratios continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in earned premiums while increasing claims frequency is putting upward pressure on our current year loss ratio. As a positive, we are continuing to experience favorable prior year loss development as our reserves as originally estimated have proven to be redundant. Also, unlike 2009, our gross written premiums grew slightly in this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010.
"We have shown that we can manage our business effectively through a competitive market compounded by a deeply suppressed economy. However, these conditions can't and won't continue indefinitely. We are confident the AMERISAFE team has the determination and discipline to continue to effectively and prudently manage our business in the near term. As conditions improve our financial strength and resource capacity will enable us to take full advantage of a growing economy in a more positive environment. In the meantime, we will continue to pursue opportunities in select markets while avoiding irrational pricing and risk selection."

At that meeting, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation to, among other things, give effect to the adoption of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the "TBOC"), which replaced the Texas Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA") effective January 1, 2010. On August 3, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") approved a new form of director and officer indemnification agreement (the "Agreement") to, among other things, conform to the TBOC.
The foregoing summary description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company's Bylaws (the "Bylaws") were adopted by its shareholders in August 2005 and subsequently amended and restated in February 2008.

Indemnitee
A. It is critically important to the Corporation and its shareholders that the Corporation be able to attract and retain the most capable persons reasonably available to serve as directors and officers of the Corporation.
B. In recognition of the need for corporations to be able to induce capable and responsible persons to accept positions in corporate management, Texas law authorizes (and in some instances requires) corporations to indemnify their directors and officers, and further authorizes corporations to purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of their directors and officers.
C. Federal legislation and rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the national securities exchanges have imposed additional disclosure and corporate governance obligations on directors and officers of public companies and have exposed such directors and officers to new and substantially broadened civil liabilities.
D. These legislative and regulatory initiatives have also exposed directors and officers of public companies to a significantly greater risk of criminal proceedings, with attendant defense costs and potential criminal fines and penalties.
E. Indemnitee is a director and/or officer of the Corporation and his/her willingness to serve in such capacity is predicated, in substantial part, upon the Corporation's willingness to indemnify him/her in accordance with the principles reflected above, to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Texas, and upon the other undertakings set forth in this Agreement.
F. Therefore, in recognition of the need to provide Indemnitee with substantial protection against personal liability, in order to procure Indemnitee's continued service as a director and/or officer of the Corporation and to enhance Indemnitee's ability to serve the Corporation in an effective manner, and in order to provide such protection pursuant to express contract rights (intended to be enforceable irrespective of, among other things, any amendment to the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation (the "") or Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "") or any change in the composition of the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "")), the Corporation wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancement of Expenses (as defined in ) to Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement and for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Corporation's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies.

Insurance and Subrogation
(a) For the duration of Indemnitee's service as a director and/or officer of the Corporation, and thereafter for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any pending or possible Proceeding or Claim, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the scope and amount of coverage available relative to the cost thereof) to cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage for directors and/or officer of the Corporation.

The Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding or Claim effected without the Corporation's prior written consent. The Corporation shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any Proceeding or Claim to which Indemnitee is, or could have been, a party unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding or Claim.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LANovember 4, 2010AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty writer of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are disappointed with our third quarter results, which reflect increasing claims frequency and severity in the quarter. I am concerned that state-mandated loss costs and premiums may not accurately reflect the claim trends in some of the states in which we operate. We have launched a number of initiatives relating to underwriting and pricing to further improve our risk selection and ensure that we are pricing those risks appropriately."
 
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "Recent claims experience has moved us to increase the current accident year loss ratio. We believe that we are taking the appropriate steps to maintain underwriting profitability. Prior year claims developed favorably, our policy retention rate remains high at 93%, and we have been successful in holding the line on expenses.
"Going forward, we will continue to work to improve our risk selection and pricing, keeping AMERISAFE in a position to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve in our industry."

Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "After seven straight quarters of premium declines, we were pleased to see a 5.6% increase in fourth quarter premium, especially given the fact that we had begun increasing our pricing late in the third quarter. We will continue to increase pricing and toughen underwriting in those subsegments of our business that performed poorly in 2009 and 2010."

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  May 2, 2011 - AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We believe we are at an inflection point in the current pricing cycle. The recent results for the workers' compensation line have dampened carrier interest. Nationally, loss experience continues at levels higher than historical averages, reflecting the impact of multi-year loss costs and rate reductions coupled with our nation's difficult economic circumstances. At the same time, demand for the product is rising."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "We are very pleased with the increase in our gross premiums written in the first quarter, especially amid tightening of underwriting standards and pricing increases. Our top line is clearly benefiting from a positive swing in our audit premiums. In terms of losses, our experience over the past two accident years has been disappointing; that experience has deteriorated as a result of increasing claims duration and what we believe to be deficient loss costs. In the meantime, we remain focused on our underwriting standards, efficient claims handling and aggressive expense management, which this quarter produced a 98.3% combined ratio."

DeRidder, LA  August 2, 2011  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our second quarter reflects the changes in the marketplace, with firming pricing and continuing increases in reported work activity. At the same time, losses from prior years continue to be challenging to bring to a satisfactory resolution. We are convinced that AMERISAFE is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace and well provisioned to resolve claims demands from prior periods."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "This was the third consecutive quarter in which we experienced year-over-year growth in our gross premiums written even while we were increasing our pricing in the last four quarters. In the second quarter, we grew from a continued rebound in audit premiums, as well as increased premiums from policies written in the quarter. We also continued intense management of our expenses in the quarter to maintain our expense ratio below 25%.
Loss development from accident years prior to 2010 remained favorable. However, our loss experience in that year and the current accident year were higher than originally estimated, causing us to raise our ultimate estimates.
Overall, we are optimistic that the underwriting and pricing initiatives we have taken in recent quarters have positioned us to take full advantage of a favorable turn in the market."

Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The third quarter exhibited encouraging signs in terms of demand, the competitive landscape and loss parameters. We remain cautiously optimistic concerning the direction of the workers' compensation marketplace. Further, we are confident that AMERISAFE is poised to take advantage of opportunities that may arise."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
September 30, 2011, our experience rated commission offset the expense ratio by 2.1 percentage points compared to 4.4 percentage points for the same period in 2010.
In the third quarter of 2011, assessment expense was favorably impacted by a $2.7 million change in estimated premium-based assessments. Our assessment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was 2.6 percentage points higher than the same period in 2010. In 2010, we experienced large rate reductions in certain loss-based assessments.
Both of these increases in the underwriting ratio were offset by lower fixed costs in 2011.
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "We are pleased that our gross premiums written increased by a robust 26% in the third quarter, along with very strong policy and premium retention. We are not ready to declare the emergence of a sustained market turn, but we are seeing evidence of a firming of the market. On the loss side, we witnessed some slowing of claims frequency in the quarter. We are encouraged by these positive improvements in our third quarter results."

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: May 9, 2012

Exhibit 99.1
DeRidder, LA  May 9, 2012AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
Financial data for the first quarter of 2011 was revised to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard for policy acquisition costs. Financial data included in this report for the three months ended March 31, 2011 has been adjusted to reflect a change for the estimate of liability for state guaranty fund assessments.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the solid results of the first quarter. Workers' compensation market conditions continue to improve both in terms of product pricing and demand. We remain focused on expanding our business in a responsible and profitable fashion."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "Our premium growth this quarter resulted from both increased organic growth and improving economic conditions within our core industries. We believe that our strengthened pricing bodes well for future underwriting results."
Investment Results
 
 
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard
As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company has adopted the new accounting standard for deferred acquisition costs, Accounting Standards Update 2010-26, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts". The new standard was adopted on a retrospective basis. The Company's adoption resulted in a $2.2 million reduction of deferred policy
acquisition costs, a $0.8 million decrease in deferred income tax liabilities and a $1.4 million decrease to shareholders' equity at December 31, 2011. The adjustment to shareholders' equity resulted in a reduction in book value of $0.08 per share based on the number of shares outstanding at January 1, 2012. Comparative period information for the first quarter of 2011 has been revised to reflect changes resulting from our retrospective adoption of the new accounting standard.
Supplemental Information
During the quarter, no shares were repurchased under the share repurchase plan. Since beginning of this plan, the Company has repurchased a total of 1,258,250 shares for $22.4 million for an average per share price of $17.78, including commissions.

Normal Vesting
(b) . Notwithstanding anything set forth in Section 3(a) to the contrary, if the Grantee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates prior to the Normal Vesting Date as a result of the Grantee's death or Disability, then the following percentage of Restricted Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) shall become nonforfeitable as of the date of such termination (the "Applicable Termination Percentage"):
Accelerated Vesting

Vesting Following Change in Control
(d) .

Dividend, Voting and Other Rights
5. . To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with the delivery of Common Shares to the Grantee or any other person under this Agreement, the number of Common Shares to be delivered to the Grantee or such other person may be reduced (based on the Market Value per
Withholding Taxes
 
Share as of the date the Common Shares become payable), if so permitted by the Committee, to provide for the taxes required to be withheld, with any fractional shares that would otherwise be delivered being rounded to the nearest whole share. In no event, however, shall the Company accept Common Shares for payment of taxes in excess of required tax withholding rates. The Committee may, at its discretion, adopt any alternative method of providing for taxes to be withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to withhold or accept Common Shares for payment of any taxes if, in the good faith determination of the Committee, such withholding or acceptance of Common Shares may result in breach of the terms of an agreement that is currently in effect and to which the Company is a party.
6. . This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed in accordance with, the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 30, 2012, AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 30, 2012

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  July 30, 2012AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 
Financial data for 2011 was revised to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard for policy acquisition costs. Financial data included in this report for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 has been adjusted to reflect a change for the estimate of liability for state guaranty fund assessments.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The workers' compensation market continues to harden. Pricing is rising. As investment yields fall, many carriers are reassessing their underwriting approach to the business and the residual markets are expanding rapidly. This changing environment presents opportunities and challenges to carriers. We believe that our focus on risk selection and pricing positions AMERISAFE for profitable growth and expansion. However in the current quarter, favorable operating results were effected by adverse prior accident year development recorded in the period."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "We are pleased that our top line continued to grow in the second quarter. Even with strong pricing, our policy retention remained high. We were disappointed with the unfavorable loss development for accident years 2010 and 2011. These accident years have been problematic for the workers' compensation industry as a whole."
Investment Results
 
 
 
Supplemental Information
During the quarter, no shares were repurchased under the share repurchase plan. Since beginning of this plan, the Company has repurchased a total of 1,258,250 shares for $22.4 million, or an average per share price of $17.78, including commissions.

On November 1, 2012, AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Date: November 1, 2012

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  November 1, 2012 - AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012.
 
Financial data for 2011 was revised to reflect an adjustment for the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard for policy acquisition costs. Financial data presented in this report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 has been adjusted to reflect a change for the estimate of liability for state guaranty fund assessments.
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "During the third quarter we have observed more signs of disruption in the workers' compensation markets. Carriers have either withdrawn from the market or significantly limited their underwriting appetite. We believe AMERISAFE is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities to grow our business profitably thereby increasing shareholder value."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "We experienced double-digit growth in premiums written for the seventh straight quarter, and both pricing and premium retention continue to be very strong. Also, our claims frequency is trending downward and overall loss development for prior years was favorable this quarter. We are pleased with these positive indications and believe our strategy for operating in today's volatile workers' compensation market is producing results."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 1, 2013, the Board of Directors of AMERISAFE, Inc. (the "Company"), appointed Michael F. Grasher as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. His appointment as CFO is expected to be effective in May 2013, following the Company's filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2013. See Item 5.02 in this Report. In connection with his appointment, the Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Grasher. The employment agreement is substantially similar to the employment agreements between the Company and each of the Company's other executive officers.
The employment agreement has an initial term of one year. The term is automatically extended for an additional one-year period unless either party provides notice not to extend the term at least 30 days prior to the expiration date. The agreement provides for an annual base salary of not less than $250,000. Mr. Grasher is also eligible to participate in the Company's incentive plans and receive employee benefits provided to other executive officers of the Company.
Under this agreement, if we terminate Mr. Grasher's employment without cause, he will be entitled to receive cash severance compensation paid in installments, and continued health benefits, for a period of 12 months. The cash severance payment is an amount equal to his then current annual base salary plus the average annual incentive award received in the prior three years. The calculation of severance benefits excludes any long-term incentive based compensation. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Grasher will not engage in activities that are competitive with our business for 12 months.
In connection with his employment, the Company will make an award of restricted common stock to Mr. Grasher. The number of shares will be determined as of the grant date based on a Black Scholes valuation. The grant date of the award is expected to be the later of Mr. Grasher's first day of employment with the Company or the second full trading day following the Company's public announcement of its financial results for the period ended March 31, 2013.
In connection with his decision to retire, the Company and Mr. Banta amended and restated his employment agreement. The restated employment agreement expires on December 31, 2014, and provides for an annual base salary of not less than $335,000. Mr. Banta continues to be eligible to participate in the Company's incentive plans and receive employee benefits provided to other executive officers of the Company.
Under this restated agreement, if we terminate Mr. Banta's employment without cause, he will be entitled to receive cash severance compensation paid in installments, and continued health benefits, for a period equal to the lesser of 12 months or through December 31, 2014. The monthly severance payment is an amount equal to one twelfth of his then current annual base salary plus the average annual incentive award received in the prior three years. The calculation of severance benefits excludes any long-term incentive based compensation. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Banta will not engage in activities that are competitive with our business for 12 months.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DeRidder, LA  May 1, 2013  AMERISAFE, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMSF), a specialty provider of hazardous workers' compensation insurance, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
 
Commenting on these results, Allen Bradley, AMERISAFE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The workers' compensation market continued to firm in the first quarter of 2013 as underwriters refocused on underwriting profitability. We expect workers' compensation pricing improvement to continue through at least the remainder of the year. AMERISAFE is pleased with our first quarter results in terms of premium growth and underwriting profitability."
Insurance Results
 
 
 
 
 
Geoff Banta, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "We are pleased with our continued quarter-over-quarter growth in premium at increased pricing levels. We also experienced another quarter of decline in frequency of claims, which we believe is the result of our focused approach to pricing, loss control and underwriting selection. As a result of these factors, we have projected a 73.2% loss ratio for the 2013 accident year, which is 3.3 percentage points lower than our projection for 2012."
