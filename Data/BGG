ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT On May 20, 2002, BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION (the "Company") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as its independent public accountants and appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as its new independent accountants. The decision to dismiss Arthur Andersen and to retain Deloitte & Touche was recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and approved by its Board of Directors. Arthur Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000, and the subsequent interim period through April 10, 2002, there were no disagreements between the Company and Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports. None of the reportable events described in Item 304(a) (1) (v) of Regulation S-K occurred during the fiscal years ended July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000, and the subsequent interim period through April 10, 2002. The Company has provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached, as Exhibit 16 is a letter from Arthur Andersen, dated May 23, 2002, stating their agreement with such statements. During the fiscal years ended July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000, and the subsequent interim period through April 10, 2002, the Company did not consult with Deloitte & Touche regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304 (a) (2) (i) and (ii) of regulation S-K. 2

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION (THE "REGISTRANT") (COMMISSION FILE NO. 1-1370) EXHIBIT INDEX TO CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATE OF REPORT: APRIL 17, 2003

EXHIBIT 99.1 BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2003 MILWAUKEE, April 17, 2003/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2003 third quarter net income of $43.0 million or $1.81 per diluted share. The net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 was $37.6 million or $1.58 per diluted share. The improvement in net income between quarters was primarily the result of significantly greater Power Products Segment sales volume, increased margins from export sales due to a stronger Euro, better utilization of production facilities, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense. These improvements were offset by increased employee benefit costs, certain production costs and variable selling costs related to the Power Products Segment. For the first nine months of fiscal 2003, the Company had net income of $47.7 million or $2.10 per diluted share. For the same period in fiscal 2002, net income was $22.6 million or $1.04 per diluted share. Significantly higher earnings for the first nine months were primarily the result of increased utilization of the Engine Segment's production facilities in the first quarter, the stronger Euro, a favorable sales mix of engine product, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. As in the third quarter, the nine months experienced a planned increase in engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee benefit costs and greater variable selling expenses. ENGINES: Third quarter sales were $499.0 million versus $468.6 million in the prior year. Approximately half of the 7% increase in sales was the result of volume increases, primarily in the parts and components categories. The remainder of the sales increase resulted from the favorable impact of a strong Euro and a sales mix of product that favored higher value engines. Nine month's sales for fiscal 2003 were $1.0 billion versus $951.6 million in the prior year. This 5% increase in sales dollars was primarily the result of revenue increases driven by the stronger Euro, favorable product mix and a slight engine unit volume increase. Income from operations for the third quarter was $65.3 million, essentially flat with the prior year. There was a $9.2 million improvement in gross profit. The majority of the improvement resulted from increased utilization of certain manufacturing facilities, higher prices, primarily resulting from the stronger Euro, implementation of planned cost reduction projects and a favorable mix of product shipments. The improvements in gross profit were partially offset by planned increases in certain manufacturing related costs. The improvement in gross profit was also offset by planned increases in engineering, selling, general and administrative costs, primarily in the areas of employee benefits and increased international selling expenses. Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 was $86.6 million versus $63.0 million a year ago. The reasons for the improvement were better utilization of all plants through higher production, higher planned prices and the strengthening of the Euro, and the benefit of manufacturing cost reduction programs that partially offset increases in certain cost categories. POWER PRODUCTS: Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $92.4 million, up $33.0 million or 55% over the same period a year ago. Increased sales were driven by significantly improved generator and pressure washer volume. Generator sales increases resulted from late winter ice storm activity, new product offerings and increased market presence at a major retailer. Pressure washer sales increases were driven by consumer demand created through strong marketing programs and increased penetration with several retailers. Sales for the first nine months were $205.5 million versus $152.7 million a year ago. Generator sales were up 50% primarily due to power outages resulting from the hurricane season and late winter ice storm activity, in addition to market share gains at selected retailers. Pressure washer sales are up 16% due to the same factors cited for the third quarter. Income from operations was $6.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of $5.5 million over the same period a year ago. Increased sales and production volumes and heightened productivity levels were the primary drivers of the improvement. The nine month's income from operations was $9.8 million versus $1.2 million for the same period a year ago. Sales volume increases accounted for approximately half of the improvement. The remainder of the change resulted from better utilization of the manufacturing facility because of increased demand for both generators and pressure washers and productivity gains from ongoing cost reduction projects.
GENERAL: The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was 31.8% and brought the year to date effective rate to 32.0%. Greater than anticipated foreign source income and the resulting tax credits have allowed the Company to lower its projected tax liability for the year. In February 2003, the Company initiated a restructuring and expansion of PUYI - Briggs & Stratton Engine Corporation (PUYI), its joint venture with the Puling and Yimin companies in China. PUYI has been manufacturing in China since 1986, producing a cast iron block engine primarily for consumption in the Southeast Asian market. Under the restructured joint venture, the partners remain the same, but Briggs & Stratton's ownership increased from 52% to 90%. In addition, the manufacturing activities will be expanded to include the production of an aluminum block, overhead valve horizontal shaft (OHV) engine. This product will be made initially for consumption in the Southeast Asian market and sold through our existing sales and distribution system in Asia. The decision reflects the excellent working relationship that has developed with PUYI over the last 15 years and our opinion that there is tremendous growth potential in China and throughout Asia for locally produced engines that address the need for lightweight, portable power sources for agriculture, irrigation and power generator uses. The OHV engine is also one of the models currently produced by the Company's Rolla, Missouri facility. Production of the engine will continue in Rolla for worldwide demand outside of Asia. OUTLOOK: We are now in the spring selling season and preliminary indications are that engine powered outdoor equipment is experiencing the demand that was originally projected at retail. Rainfall has been plentiful across all major market areas, so at this time we believe consumer demand for lawn and garden equipment will continue as anticipated throughout the spring. In previous quarters we had projected $72 million of net income for fiscal 2003. Because we expect the effective tax rate to be 32.0% for the year, we now believe that net income for the year will be in the $74-$76 million range. For the year, we anticipate that consolidated sales will be 4% higher than the prior fiscal year and gross profit margins will be close to 19.6%. Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses are forecasted to be approximately $167 million, and interest expense is estimated to be at the $40 million level. Full year depreciation is projected to be $60 million and we are estimating capital expenditures to be in the $45-$50 million range. The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on its corporate website: http://www.briggsandstratton.com/shareholders . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (800) 960-1013. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

ITEM 12.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On August 7, 2003, Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced fiscal 2003 fourth quarter and twelve months results as of June 29, 2003 in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Date August 7, 2003
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced fiscal 2003 fourth quarter net sales of $508.1 million and net income of $32.9 million or $1.52 per basic share and $1.39 per diluted share. Net sales were $459.7 million in the same period a year ago and net income was $30.6 million or $1.41 per basic share and $1.30 per diluted share. The 11% improvement in net sales was primarily due to gains by the Power Products Segment, while the net income increase between quarters was the result of greater sales volume, manufacturing cost reduction programs and increased production in both business segments, offset by the impact of a sales mix that favored lower priced products and higher operating expenses.
 
For fiscal 2003, the Company reported net sales of $1.66 billion and net income of $80.6 million or $3.73 per basic share and $3.49 per diluted share. For fiscal 2002, net sales were $1.53 billion and net income was $53.1 million or $2.46 per basic share and $2.36 per diluted share. Major factors in the 52% increase in net income between years were greater sales volume, manufacturing cost reduction programs, improved margins on export sales primarily due to a stronger Euro, increased production, lower interest expense and a reduced effective tax rate. As in the fourth quarter, higher operating expenses for the year were an offset to net income gains.
 
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2003 fourth quarter net sales of engines were $432.5 million versus $412.0 million in the prior year. The 5% increase is primarily the result of an increase in engine and service parts sales volume.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2003 were $1.43 billion, which was $69.4 million or 5% higher than fiscal 2002. On a year over year basis, engine unit volume accounted for about $28 million of the sales increase. International service and component parts volumes were another $22 million and the remainder of the increase was primarily price improvement on international sales, as a result of the stronger Euro.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $48.7 million compared to $52.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. This $3.9 million decrease was the result of lower margined domestic engine shipments and higher operating expenses that were related to employee benefits and marketing costs. The decreased margin was offset by the higher sales volume, discussed above, and manufacturing cost reduction programs.
 
The fiscal 2003 income from operations was $135.3 million, an increase of $19.7 million or 17% over fiscal 2002 results. Factors contributing to the improvement included manufacturing cost reduction programs, an 11% production volume increase, improved margins on European sales due to the stronger Euro and increased sales volume. These gains were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that resulted from increased employee benefits and marketing and international selling expenses.
 
 
Power Products:
 
Net sales were $117.5 million in the fourth quarter, up $52.1 million or 80% over the same period a year ago. Pressure washer sales were up 89% on unit volume increases of 113%. The introduction of successful promotional programs at key retailers drove strong retail demand resulting in significantly improved volume. Generator sales were up 79% on a unit volume increase of 85%. Weather events and additional market penetration at a major retailer drove the volume improvement.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2003 were $323.0 million, increasing $104.9 million or 48% over the fiscal 2002 results. Generator sales were up 56% on a unit volume increase of 64%. The volume increase was the result of fiscal 2003 having more weather events that create demand than were experienced in fiscal 2002, increased promotional activity at retail and additional market penetration at a major retailer. Pressure washer sales increased 43% on a 60% unit volume increase. The volume increase resulted from the same factors discussed for the quarterly improvement.
 
Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $9.4 million, up $7.4 million over the same period a year ago. The improvement is the result of sales volume increases, improved productivity and lower material costs.
 
Fiscal 2003 income from operations was $19.2 million compared to $3.3 million for fiscal 2002. The reasons for the fiscal year operating income improvement are the same as discussed for the fourth quarter.
General:
 
Interest expense was down in the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year due to lower borrowing levels and the impact of a fixed to variable interest rate swap. Capital expenditures and depreciation for fiscal 2003 were $40.2 million and $58.3 million, respectively.
 
 
Outlook For Fiscal 2004:
 
Our current estimate for fiscal 2004 anticipates net income in the range of $90 to $95 million. Consolidated sales growth is estimated at 3%. Engine Segment unit volume is forecasted to grow 2-4%, in line with our estimate of market growth. It is also anticipated that a stronger Euro will provide improved pricing on European sales. Power Products Segment sales are forecasted to grow 4-6%, which represents our estimate of the market growth for next year assuming similar weather event activity.
 
Gross profit margin for the year is projected to be in the range of 21.0% to 21.5%. These rates anticipate increased engine plant utilization in fiscal 2004. We believe engine production could be up 4-6% for the year. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing manufacturing costs in both the Engine and Power Products Segments. As in fiscal 2003, our plans for fiscal 2004 include reductions in manufacturing costs that more than offset the effect of rising cost categories such as health care.
 
Operating expenses are estimated to be from $189 to $193 million reflecting increased employee benefit costs, increased product marketing programs to drive category growth and engineering for future product development. Interest expense is estimated to be $39 million. We are assuming an effective tax rate of 32%. The estimates for depreciation and capital expenditures are $65 million and $60 million, respectively.

On October 16, 2003, Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced fiscal 2004 first quarter results as of September 28, 2003 in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced first quarter net income of $4.0 million or $.18 per diluted share. The results represent an $11.0 million improvement over the $7.0 million or $.32 per diluted share loss experienced in the first quarter of last year.
 
The improved first quarter earnings resulted primarily from significantly increased consolidated sales that were up $95 million or 40% between years and greater production volumes that increased the utilization of our operating facilities.
 
Engines:
 
First quarter sales were $235.7 million, a $40.8 million or 21% improvement over the prior year. The increase was due to increased unit volume of 27%. The unit volume increase was the result of solid late summer retail demand for lawn and garden equipment caused by favorable weather conditions and a high level of demand for engines used to power generators and pressure washers.
 
Income from operations was $4.0 million, an improvement of $7.8 million over a loss of $3.8 million a year ago. The improvement was the result of the increased sales volume and increased production levels that increased utilization of several manufacturing operations. Operating expenses, that increased as planned, offset some of the volume related gains.
 
Power Products:
 
First quarter sales were $124.8 million, a $71.1 million or 132% increase over last year. Unit volumes increased 172% with both the generator and pressure washer product lines contributing equally in the improvement.
 
First quarter generator sales were significantly impacted by the wide spread power outages that occurred both as a result of the failure of the eastern electrical grid and the landfall of a major hurricane. Last year's first quarter experienced no major power outages. Pressure washer sales continue to reflect demand generated by new product and promotional programs developed in conjunction with key retailers in the spring of 2003. The success of these product and promotional programs continued to be greater than originally anticipated.
 
Income from operations was $8.7 million, an improvement of $7.2 million over the same period a year ago. While the majority of the improvement was the result of increased sales volume, a portion of the improvement was related to better margins created by improved utilization of our manufacturing facility due to increased throughput.
Outlook:
 
Our 2004 first quarter sales were higher than we anticipated as a result of unforeseen events, essentially the widespread power outages and the sustained demand for lawn and garden equipment. We do not anticipate that the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2004 should vary from our initial projections. Therefore, we now anticipate that net income for the year will be in the range of $100 to $105 million. Our updated forecast projects consolidated sales to grow in the 6% to 7% range for the year, with the Power Products Segment approaching $400 million in sales. This assumes weather related power outage events for the balance of this year to be similar to last year's experience.
 
For fiscal 2004, gross profit margins continue to be projected in the range of 21.0% to 21.5% and operating expenses are forecasted in the $189 to $193 million range. Interest expense is anticipated to be $39 million and we are assuming a 32% effective tax rate. Depreciation is estimated to be $65 million, and capital expenditures are still planned at $60 million.
 
Fiscal second quarter sales are projected to be up over last year by approximately 5%. We are anticipating gross profit margins for the next quarter to be approximately 20% and operating expenses of $48 million.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND NET INCOME FOR THE
SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004
 
MILWAUKEE, January 22, 2004/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2004 second quarter consolidated net sales of $416.0 million and net income of $20.6 million or $.87 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2003 had consolidated net sales of $352.6 million and net income of $11.7 million or $.53 per diluted share. The $63.4 million consolidated net sales increase was the result of volume increases in both the Engine and Power Products business segments, a mix of engine shipments that favored higher priced product and a benefit from more favorable exchange rates on Euro denominated engine sales. Increases in sales and production volumes in both business segments and the stronger Euro drove the net income improvement of $8.9 million.
 
For the first six months of fiscal 2004, the Company had net sales of $747.4 million and net income of $24.6 million or $1.08 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, net sales were $589.1 million and net income was $4.7 million or $.22 per diluted share. Most of the $158.3 million sales increase for the first six months was the result of volume improvement, primarily in the Power Products segment. The majority of the six month net income improvement of $19.9 million was the result of strong production volume increases in both business segments, a benefit from more favorable exchange rates on Euro denominated engine sales and the sales volume improvement experienced in the Power Products segment.
 
Engines:
 
Second quarter sales were $357.8 million versus $305.2 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 17%. The 17% improvement was the result of a 13% increase in engine unit shipments and an $11.0 million improvement from favorable exchange rates on Euro denominated sales. The favorable mix of engine product at higher prices was basically offset by lower die cast component sales. Sales for the first half of fiscal 2004 were $592.2 million versus $500.1 million in the prior year, an 18% improvement. An engine unit shipment increase of 17% and a favorable Euro impact of $13.8 million were the main drivers of the sales increase.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $35.4 million, up $11.7 million or 49% from the same period in the prior year. The $11.0 million Euro impact described above accounts for the improvement. Although the quarter experienced gains from increased production and sales volume, as well as reductions in selected manufacturing costs, these gains were offset by a sales mix that favored lower margined product and an increase in operating expenses. We believe a majority of the mix impact will reverse itself in future quarters. Operating expenses are projected to be higher this year due to anticipated costs related to employees, increased marketing efforts and professional fees.
 
Income from operations for the first half of fiscal 2004 was $38.7 million, up $18.7 million or 94% from the same period a year ago. The majority of the six month improvement is due to the Euro improvement of $13.8 million, increased production levels which allowed for a better spreading of fixed costs and successful manufacturing cost reduction programs. As in the second quarter, increased operating costs offset some of the gains generated by the high level of production. In addition, the mix of engines that favored lower margined product offset gains from increased engine shipment volume.
 
Power Products:
 
Second quarter sales were $97.6 million versus $61.3 million from the same period a year ago, an increase of 59%. The 59% improvement was the result of a pressure washer shipment volume increase of 180% and a generator volume increase of 34%. The pressure washer increase was caused by promotional programs at certain major retailers that positioned the product as a holiday gift item. Historically, pressure washers have been primarily a spring and summer product. Generator demand continues to increase due to product awareness created by last summer's landfall of a major hurricane and the power grid failure experienced in the Eastern United States.
Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2004 were $223.2 million versus $114.9 million in the prior year, a 94% increase. Generator volume increases, for the same reasons identified for the second quarter, account for approximately 60% of this increase. Pressure washer volume accounts for the remainder of the increase. This increase was driven by advertising and promotional programs at major retailers and our Spring 2003 introduction of a new product offering that has been very successful at retail.
 
Income from operations was $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, an improvement of $3.4 million over the same period a year ago. A 250% increase in production volume and the favorable impact it had on the spreading of fixed costs was the main contributor to the improvement. In addition, sales volume increases improved the margin. Partially offsetting the margin improvement from sales and production volume was increased spending on variable costs associated with higher production and sales levels. The income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $14.6 million, an improvement of $11.3 million over the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. Consistent with the second quarter, the key drivers of margin improvement were a sales volume increase of 127% and a production volume increase of 176%. However, increased variable manufacturing and selling costs related to the high volumes offset a portion of the margin benefit.
 
Outlook:
 
We are raising our forecast of net income for fiscal 2004 to be in the range of $105 to $110 million. We believe this increase is appropriate at this time because the consolidated sales forecast for fiscal 2004 now anticipates growth of approximately 9%, with the majority of the growth improvement being provided by Power Products segment sales that are forecasted to approach $425 million. Gross margins are projected to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.0%. This improved range reflects our favorable experience to date with the many components that affect gross margins. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $200 million, reflecting the variable nature of some costs associated with a higher level of sales. Interest expense is anticipated to be $39 million, other income approximately $4 million and we are assuming an effective tax rate of 32% for the year. Depreciation is estimated to be $65 million and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $60 million.
 
Quarterly projections for the last half of fiscal 2004 are complicated by our ability to anticipate the timing and mix of product that will be required to satisfy demand resulting from retail sales. Consequently, our sales forecast for the fiscal 2004 third quarter is a range of $600 to $635 million. Gross margins are projected to be approximately 23.0% and operating expenses are estimated at approximately $53 million. Interest expense is projected at $10 million and other income at $2 million. Depreciation and capital expenditures are both estimated to be approximately $16 million. Third quarter net income is projected to be in the range of $54 to $59 million. This third quarter forecast implies that the fourth quarter sales and net income will be lower than what was experienced in the fourth quarter last year. We feel this potential shift in demand is the result of our customers taking product earlier in order to have inventory to satisfy anticipated retail demand.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS STRONG SALES AND NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004
 
MILWAUKEE, WI April 22, 2004/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2004 third quarter consolidated net sales of $654.7 million and net income of $71.3 million or $2.88 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2003 had consolidated net sales of $560.4 million and net income of $43.0 million or $1.81 per diluted share. The $94.3 million or 17% consolidated net sales increase was primarily the result of shipment increases in both the Engines and Power Products business segments. The net income increase of $28.3 million was the result of increased Engines segment sales, a shipment mix that favored engines with higher margins, and greater production volumes in both business segments that lowered unit costs.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the Company had net sales of $1,402.1 million and net income of $95.9 million or $3.95 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, net sales were $1,149.5 million, and net income was $47.7 million or $2.10 per diluted share. Most of the $252.6 million or 22% sales increase for the first nine months was the result of increased shipments that occurred in both business segments. The majority of the nine-month net income improvement of $48.2 million was the result of increased sales, primarily in the Engines segment, strong production volume increases in both business segments, and a benefit from more favorable exchange rates in fiscal 2004 on Euro denominated engine sales.
 
Engines:
 
Third quarter sales were $581.9 million versus $496.9 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $85.0 million or 17%. A majority of the 17% improvement was the result of a 13% increase in engine unit shipments. The remainder of the improvement was the result of a favorable mix of engine shipments and a $4.4 million revenue improvement from favorable exchange rates on Euro denominated sales.
 
Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 were $1,174.1 million versus $997.0 million in the prior year, an improvement of $177.1 million or 18%. An engine unit shipment increase of 15% and a favorable Euro impact of $22.3 million were the main drivers of the sales increase.
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $110.0 million, up $44.6 million or 68% from the same period in the prior year. The major contributor was the sales volume increase that made up over 50% of the improvement. Additional contributions to the improvement came from lower manufacturing expenses due to cost reduction initiatives, a favorable mix of engine shipments, greater production volume that lowered unit costs, and the $4.4 million Euro benefit referenced above. The improvements were partially offset by increased operating expenses. Operating expenses are projected to be higher this year due to anticipated costs related to employees, increased marketing efforts and professional fees.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was $148.7 million, up $63.4 million or 74% from the same period a year ago. The reasons for the improvement are the same as discussed for the quarter except that the Euro benefit of $22.3 million had a greater impact and, at the same time, product mix played a lesser role because favorable mix was a result of timing between quarters. As in the third quarter, operating costs for the nine months increased and offset some of the gains.
 
Power Products:
 
Third quarter sales were $125.6 million versus $94.9 million from the same period a year ago, an increase of $30.7 million or 32%. The 32% improvement was the result of a pressure washer shipment volume increase of 40% and a generator volume increase of 34%. The pressure washer increase resulted from our major retailers aggressively stocking in anticipation of another strong selling season. Although we have not yet entered the hurricane season, generator demand continues to increase due to product awareness created by last summer's landfall of a major hurricane and the power grid failure experienced in the Eastern United States.
 
Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 were $348.8 million versus $209.8 million in the prior year, a $139.0 million or 66% increase. Generator volume increases, for the same reasons identified for the third quarter, account for just over 50% of this increase. Pressure washer volume accounts for the remainder of the increase. The pressure washer increase was driven by advertising and promotional programs at major retailers, a successful new product offering, and increased placement at certain major retailers.
 
Income from operations was $7.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, an improvement of $1.6 million over the same period a year ago. A significant increase in production volume reduced unit costs by almost $6.0 million. Offsetting the production volume related gains was an increase of $4.0 million in the cost of components purchased from Europe. The cost of these components has increased significantly as the Euro has strengthened.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was $21.9 million, an improvement of $12.8 million over the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. Major drivers of income improvement were the significant production volume increase that reduced unit costs and the strong generator and pressure washer sales volume increases that occurred in the first half of fiscal 2004. However, the cost of European sourced components discussed for the quarter, had a negative impact of $7.0 million. In addition, increased variable manufacturing costs related to the high production volumes also offset a portion of the gain derived from increased sales and production volumes.
 
General:
 
The effective tax rate for the fiscal 2004 third quarter increased over the prior year. This increase reflects recognition that our European sales are lower this year and hence the foreign tax credit that is derived from the income on those sales will be less. We believe that the effective rate for entire fiscal 2004 will be 34.5%.
 
Outlook:
 
As we provide this fourth quarter projection we believe that the spring retail selling season will be strong for both business segments. Consequently, our sales forecast for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter should be very similar to the actual results achieved last year. Gross margins are projected to be approximately 24.5%, reflecting the benefit of high production volumes and continuing cost reduction programs. Operating expenses are estimated at approximately $55 million. Interest expense is projected at $9 million and other income at $2 million. The effective tax rate is projected at 38%. As a result, fourth quarter net income is anticipated to be in the range of $35 to $40 million. Depreciation and capital expenditures are both estimated to be approximately $16 million.
 
The fourth quarter projection means our forecast of net income for fiscal 2004 will be in the range of $130 to $135 million. Consolidated sales projections anticipate growth of approximately 15%, with approximately 60% of the growth improvement being provided by Power Products segment sales that are forecasted to approach $450 million for the fiscal year. The remainder of the net sales growth is attributable to engines and reflects our current opinion that we have experienced increased market penetration in fiscal 2004, in addition to the forecasted domestic market growth of 2% to 4% for the fiscal year. Gross margins are projected to be in the range of 23.0% to 23.5%. This improved range reflects our belief that current production levels will continue and results of cost control and reduction programs will remain favorable. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $206 million, reflecting the variable nature of some costs associated with a higher level of sales. Interest expense is anticipated to be $38 million, and other income approximately $8 million. We are assuming an effective tax rate of 34.5% for the year. Depreciation is estimated to be $65 million, and capital expenditures are projected to be $50 to $55 million.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On August 5, 2004, Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and twelve month results as of June 27, 2004 in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced fiscal 2004 fourth quarter net sales of $545.3 million and net income of $40.2 million or $1.70 per basic share and $1.61 per diluted share. Net sales were $508.1 million in the same period a year ago and net income was $32.9 million or $1.52 per basic share and $1.39 per diluted share. The majority of the 7% improvement in quarterly net sales was due to unit volume increases in both business segments and an Engines Segment sales mix that favored higher priced product. The net income increase between quarters occurred primarily in the Engines Segment as a result of successful manufacturing cost reduction programs, increased sales volume, increased production volumes and a sales mix that favored higher margined products. The Company experienced higher manufacturing costs in the quarter, primarily for purchases of components and materials, which offset net income gains.
 
For fiscal 2004, the Company reported net sales of $1.95 billion and net income of $136.1 million or $6.01 per basic share and $5.53 per diluted share. For fiscal 2003, net sales were $1.66 billion and net income was $80.6 million or $3.73 per basic share and $3.49 per diluted share. The 17% improvement in net sales was primarily the result of greater unit sales volume in both business segments. Major factors contributing to the 69% increase in net income between years were greater sales and production volumes in both business segments, Engines Segment manufacturing cost reduction programs and improved margins on export sales due to a stronger Euro. For the year, higher manufacturing and operating expenses were an offset to net income gains.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter net sales of engines were $443.3 million versus $431.4 million in the prior year. The 3% increase is primarily the result of a 2% increase in engine unit sales volume.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2004 were $1.62 billion, which was $189.0 million or 13% higher than fiscal 2003. On a year over year basis, engine unit volume accounted for about $163 million of the sales increase.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $60.6 million compared to $49.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. This $11.2 million increase was the result of successful manufacturing cost reduction programs, greater sales and production volume and a sales mix that favored higher margined products. Higher manufacturing expenses related to surcharges for raw materials and increased employee benefit costs offset a portion of the favorable operating margin improvement factors.
 
The fiscal 2004 income from operations was $209.3 million, an increase of $74.6 million or 55% over fiscal 2003 results. Factors contributing to the improvement were essentially the same as described for the quarter but also included improved margins on European sales due to a Euro exchange rate that was more favorable than in the prior year. These gains were partially offset by an increase in manufacturing costs as described for the quarter and operating expenses which included increased employee benefit costs, professional services fees, marketing and international selling expenses.
 
Power Products:
 
Net sales were $140.4 million in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, up $20.8 million or 17% over the same period a year ago. Unit volume increased 11%. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of the mix of sales favoring higher priced generator units during the quarter.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2004 were $489.3 million, increasing $159.8 million or 48% over the fiscal 2003 results. Unit volume increased 50%. The volume increase was the result of fiscal 2004 having more demand creating events for generators than were experienced in fiscal 2003, the introduction of new pressure washer product and increased promotional activity at retail and additional market penetration for both generators and pressure washer product.
 
Income from operations in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter was $8.6 million, up $.4 million over the same period a year ago. The relatively flat income between years reflects an improvement in operating income resulting from benefits of slight sales and production increases offset by higher costs for components purchased in Euros from Italy.
 
Fiscal 2004 income from operations was $30.4 million compared to $17.2 million in fiscal 2003. For the year, the sales and production volume increases were partially offset by the increase in material costs related to the components purchased in Euros.
 
Outlook For Fiscal 2005:
 
Our initial estimate for fiscal 2005 anticipates net income in the range of $160 to $165 million. These projections include the forecasts of our recently completed acquisition of Simplicity Manufacturing Inc. ("Simplicity"). Consolidated sales are estimated to increase approximately 20%. Engines Segment net sales are forecasted to grow 4-5% from a combination of price and volume growth. Power Products Segment net sales are forecasted to grow 75-80%. The growth includes a forecast of $360 million of net sales resulting from Simplicity and an estimate of a net 5% growth for the generator and pressure washer products.
Consolidated gross profit margin for the year is projected to be in the range of 23% to 24%. The greatest challenge to achieving this gross margin level will be the upward cost pressure we are projecting to continue for manufacturing costs, primarily for purchased components and raw materials. We plan on a combination of price and volume increases to offset a portion of the increasing costs. In addition, our plans for fiscal 2005 include significant reductions in cost from our ongoing focus on manufacturing cost reduction programs.
 
Consolidated operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $274 million. The projected operating expenses for Simplicity are approximately $63 million. Interest expense is estimated to be $32 million, and other income is projected in the $10-$12 million range. We are assuming an effective tax rate of 36%. The estimates for depreciation and capital expenditures are $68 million and $87 million, respectively.
 
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 206-7202. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week. Dial (888) 266-2081 to access the replay. The pass code will be 520832.

Other Matters:
 
In June 2004, a lawsuit was filed against the Company and other defendants alleging that horsepower labels on lawnmower products purchased by the plaintiffs were inaccurate. The complaint seeks an injunction, compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees on behalf of persons who bought lawnmowers since June 1999 powered by gasoline engines up to 20 horsepower. No orders have been entered in the case, and there has been no discovery. The Company intends to vigorously defend this case.

Explanatory Note
 
This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K filed on August 6, 2004 to reflect the fact that Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche") has issued its audit report on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004. Accordingly, the change in auditors became effective September 9, 2004.
 
 
On August 4, 2004, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") notified Deloitte & Touche of its dismissal as the Company's independent public accountant and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as the Company's new independent public accountant. The decision to dismiss Deloitte & Touche and to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers was made by the Company's Audit Committee at its meeting on August 3, 2004.
 
This action dismisses Deloitte & Touche as the Company's independent public accountant for the fiscal year that commenced June 28, 2004. The change in auditors became effective on September 9, 2004 following the completion and issuance of Deloitte & Touche's audit report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003, which report did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
 
For the fiscal years ended June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003 and through the date of this Form 8-K/A, there have been no disagreements with Deloitte & Touche on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte & Touche, would have caused it to make reference thereto in its report on the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003.
 
None of the reportable events described in Item 304(a) (1) (v) of Regulation S-K occurred during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003, and through the date of this Form 8-K/A.
 
During the fiscal years ended June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003, and through August 4, 2004 (the date PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed), the Company did not consult with PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304 (a) (2) (i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Company has requested Deloitte & Touche to furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the foregoing disclosures. A copy of that letter, dated September 9, 2004 is filed as Exhibit 16.2 to this Form 8-K/A.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS POTENTIAL LOSS ON TRADE RECEIVABLE AND REVISES ITS ESTIMATES OF NET INCOME
 
MILWAUKEE, WI October 18, 2004/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced that it has identified the need to increase its reserve for uncollectible receivables by $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
The Company has a $40 million accounts receivable due from a major original equipment customer, which it believes could become uncollectible in part at some future date. Based on information presently available, management believes a $10 million increase in its reserve is sufficient for the potential loss on this account.
 
The $10 million pretax expense was not anticipated in the original earnings guidance we provided for the fiscal 2005 first quarter and full year results in our August 5, 2004 earnings release. After giving consideration to the $10 million expense we estimate reporting a first quarter loss of approximately $1.5 million or $.06 per diluted share on October 21, 2004. We also are revising our projection for fiscal 2005 net income from the previously announced $160 to $165 million range to a range of $150 to $160 million to reflect the impact of the first quarter write down.
 
This release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "intend", "may", "objective", "plan", "project", "seek", "think", "will", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that include, among other things, our customer's ability to successfully obtain financing; the actions of other suppliers and the customers of the equipment manufacturer; actions by potential acquirers of the customer; the ability to successfully forecast demand for our products and appropriately adjust our manufacturing and inventory levels; changes in our operating expenses; changes in interest rates; the effects of weather on the purchasing patterns of consumers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); actions of engine manufacturers and OEMs with whom we compete; the seasonal nature of our business; changes in laws and regulations, including environmental, pension funding and accounting standards; work stoppages or other consequences of any deterioration in our employee relations; work stoppages by other unions that affect the ability of suppliers or customers to manufacture; acts of war or terrorism that may disrupt our business operations or those of our customers and suppliers; changes in customer and OEM demand; changes in prices of raw materials and parts that we purchase; changes in domestic economic conditions, including housing starts and changes in consumer disposable income; changes in foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations; new facts that come to light in the future course of litigation proceedings which could affect our assessment of those matters; our ability to successfully integrate the Simplicity acquisition; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. Some or all of the factors may be beyond our control. We caution you that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On October 21, 2004, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing fiscal 2005 first quarter results as of September 26, 2004 in a press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced first quarter consolidated net sales of $439.0 million and a net loss of $1.5 million or $.06 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales increased $107.6 million or 32% over the prior year while net income decreased $5.5 million over the same period a year ago. The primary factor that caused the first quarter results to be less than last year was a $10.0 million ($6.4 million after tax) increase in the reserve for uncollectible receivables caused by the financial difficulties of a customer.
 
The majority of the $107.6 million net sales increase was due to the inclusion of $79.5 million of sales of our Simplicity Manufacturing, Inc. ("Simplicity") acquisition, which was completed on July 7, 2004. The remainder of the net sales increase was the result of a mix of shipments that favored higher priced, higher horsepower engines and an increase in generator shipments due to the high number of demand creating weather events.
 
The first quarter benefited from better engine mix, increased engine production, lower interest expense and higher dividend income. These improvements more than offset cost increases for raw materials and components that continue to be at high levels however, the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts created a net loss for the quarter. The Simplicity acquisition did not benefit the first quarter because of the accounting treatment required on the acquired inventory.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2005 first quarter net sales were $254.1 million, an $18.4 million or 8% improvement over the prior year. This increase is primarily due to a first quarter mix of shipments that favored higher priced, higher horsepower engines. The favorable mix was created by strong summer demand for riding lawnmower equipment and the need for the larger engines used in portable generators.
 
The loss from operations was $4.7 million, a decrease of $8.7 million from the income reported for the same period a year ago. A favorable mix of engine shipments, price improvement and a significant increase in plant utilization in the first quarter provided positive contributions to income from operations. However, income from operations was lowered between years by the previously mentioned $10.0 million accounts receivable reserve increase and increased raw material and component costs.
 
Power Products:
 
First quarter net sales were $222.3 million, a $97.5 million or 78% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was the result of having $79.5 million of sales from our Simplicity acquisition and a 30% unit increase in the shipment of generators. These positive trends were partially offset by a 6% decrease in pressure washer unit shipments. Last year's first quarter generator sales were primarily impacted by the East Coast power grid failure. The unusual level of hurricane activity in this year's first quarter created a concentrated demand that was capped by product availability.
 
Income from operations was $5.2 million, a decrease of $3.5 million or 41% from the prior year. The operating income improvement from increased generator volume was offset by lower unit pricing experienced on pressure washer shipments, higher costs for steel and copper and lower utilization of the production capacity. Pressure washer production was approximately 50% lower than last year because of increased inventory levels between years. The Simplicity acquisition negatively impacted income from operations by $.8 million primarily resulting from the application of purchase accounting rules that increased the cost of sales by $4.0 million.
 
General:
 
Interest expense is lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 because outstanding long-term debt is lower than last year's level. The effective tax rate is at 36% versus the 32% used in the first quarter last year.
Outlook:
 
We believe the stronger than anticipated first quarter sales of generators allows us to increase our sales forecast for the Power Products Segment. In addition, as we assess preliminary engine demand and placement, we now believe that engine unit volume could increase by approximately 6% instead of the 3% originally anticipated. Consequently, we now project that consolidated net sales for the year will be approximately 26% higher than last year. The sales of our Simplicity acquisition continue to be projected at $360 million.
 
Consolidated gross profit margin for the year is currently projected to be 22% to 23%. We have reduced our margin projection to reflect that the higher costs experienced on certain raw materials and components in the first quarter will remain at these levels for the full fiscal year. An incremental 4% price increase on certain powered products, in addition to our initial price increase and our cost reduction initiatives will not fully offset these higher costs.
 
Consolidated operating expenses are estimated to be between 11% and 12% of net sales. Interest expense is estimated to be $32 million, and other income is projected to be in the $12 to $14 million range. This projection assumes an effective tax rate of 36% for the year, but the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 could have an impact on our rate going forward. These assumptions result in an annual net income forecast in the range of $150 to $160 million.
 
We project that second quarter sales will be approximately 28% greater than last year. Operating margins are estimated to be slightly lower than last year due to purchase accounting for Simplicity and net income is forecast to be up about 28% over the same period a year ago.
 
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 802-4362. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD
 
On November 8, 2004, Murray Inc., an original equipment manufacturer of powered lawn and garden equipment and one of Briggs & Stratton's top three customers, filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Murray also announced that it has secured debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and that it believes Chapter 11 protection should ensure continuation of business through the ultimate sale of the Company.
 
As previously announced in a press release dated October 18, 2004, Briggs & Stratton increased its reserve for uncollectible receivables by $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Briggs & Stratton has approximately $40 million of accounts receivable due from Murray Inc. Based on all of the information available at this time, management continues to believe that $10 million is its best estimate of the potential loss on this account. Management will continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings going forward. Any additional impairment or loss of business resulting from these proceedings could negatively impact our ability to achieve forecasted performance levels.

ITEM 2.06. MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS
 
On November 30, 2004, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing that it is currently evaluating the potential acquisition of selected assets of bankrupt Murray Inc. ("Murray") and the determination of additional impairment on the trade receivable from Murray.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION TO EVALUATE ACQUISITION OF SELECTED ASSETS OF BANKRUPT MURRAY, INC.
 
MILWAUKEE, WI November 30, 2004/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") today announced that it is evaluating the acquisition of certain assets of Murray, Inc. ("Murray"), a major original equipment customer who filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 8, 2004.
 
On October 18, 2004, the Company announced that it was establishing a $10 million reserve on a trade receivable from Murray of approximately $40 million because of developments affecting Murray. The Company is now participating in discussions with Murray regarding the Company's interest in purchasing certain assets of Murray. In connection with this acquisition, the Company would seek to realize value from the assets acquired that would exceed the amount of the trade receivable and the price paid for the Murray assets. Completion of a transaction is subject to agreement on price, the negotiation of a purchase agreement, approval by the Company's Board and other customary conditions for a transaction of this type, as well as approval by the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be met or that a transaction will be completed.
 
If the Company succeeds in its bid for these assets, accounting rules would require it to separately assess the economics of the asset acquisition and its pre-existing customer relationship with Murray. Consequently, the consummation of a transaction would result in the impairment of substantially all of the remaining trade receivable from Murray. This would require the Company to recognize an additional loss of approximately $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Even if the Company ultimately does not proceed with a transaction and another party acquires the assets of Murray, or Murray implements another plan approved by the Bankruptcy Court, it is likely that the trade receivable from Murray will be further impaired. Based on these developments, on November 29, 2004 the Company determined that the Murray receivable is further impaired. However, the extent of the impairment depends on the outcome of Murray's bankruptcy proceedings and therefore cannot be quantified at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation and make a determination as to the final amount of the impairment when more complete information is available.
 
This release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The words "approval", "conditions", "determine", "evaluate", "if", "negotiate", "outcome", "seek", "subject to", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that include, among other things, our ability to successfully negotiate a purchase agreement; obtain approval of the negotiated agreement from several different constituencies; obtain economically reasonable financing for the transaction; the actions of other suppliers and the customers of the equipment manufacturer; actions by other potential acquirers of the customer; the ability to successfully realize the maximum market value of acquired assets; the effects of weather on the purchasing patterns of consumers; the seasonal nature of the lawn and garden business; changes in laws and regulations, including environmental, pension funding and accounting standards; work stoppages or other consequences of any deterioration in Murray's employee relations; acts of war or terrorism that may disrupt our business operations or those of our customers and suppliers; changes in customer and OEM demand; changes in prices of raw materials and parts that we purchase; changes in domestic economic conditions, including housing starts and changes in consumer disposable income; changes in foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations; new facts that come to light in the future course of litigation proceedings which could affect our assessment of those matters; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Briggs & Stratton Takes Additional Impairment on Trade Receivable from Bankrupt Murray, Inc.
 
On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") approved the Company's offer in United States Bankruptcy Court to buy certain assets of Murray, Inc. ("Murray") for $150 million. Under the terms of the offer, the Company would acquire substantially all of the assets of Murray, with the exception of real estate located in the United States. The offer also is for the common stock of Hayter, Ltd., a lawn and garden equipment manufacturer located in the United Kingdom. The transaction is contingent upon negotiation and execution of mutually acceptable purchase agreements, satisfactory completion of due diligence, a bankruptcy auction process, and bankruptcy court and regulatory approvals.
 
On October 18, 2004, the Company announced that it was establishing a $10 million reserve on a trade receivable from Murray of approximately $40 million because of developments affecting Murray. On November 30, 2004, the Company indicated that its receivable likely was further impaired, but was unable to quantify the amount of the impairment. Based on the current status of our negotiations with Murray and its bankruptcy proceedings, we now believe our receivable is likely fully impaired. Consequently, we will recognize an additional pretax loss of approximately $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. This will result in an after-tax charge of approximately $19 million or $.37 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2005
 
MILWAUKEE, January 21, 2005/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2005 second quarter consolidated net sales of $503.7 million and consolidated net income of $7.1 million or $.14 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2004 had consolidated net sales of $416.0 million and net income of $20.6 million or $.43 per diluted share. The majority of the $87.7 million or 21% increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of $72.4 million of sales from the Simplicity Manufacturing, Inc. ("Simplicity") acquisition in July of 2004. The Engine business segment was primarily responsible for the remainder of the increase through price improvement and a mix of shipments that favored higher priced product. Consolidated net income declined $13.5 million between years due to a $30.0 million ($19.7 million after tax) increase in the reserve for uncollectible receivables for a trade receivable due from a bankrupt customer. Without the write down of the trade receivable, consolidated net income for the second quarter improved over the same period a year ago due to the price improvement and favorable mix of engine product sold in the Engine business segment.
 
For the first six months of fiscal 2005, the Company had consolidated net sales of $942.7 million and consolidated net income of $5.6 million or $.11 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $747.4 million and consolidated net income was $24.7 million or $.54 per diluted share. The majority of the $195.3 million or 26% increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of $151.9 million of sales from the Simplicity acquisition. The Engine business segment was primarily responsible for the remainder of the increase resulting from a mix of shipments that favored higher priced product and price improvement experienced in the second quarter. Consolidated net income declined $19.1 million between the comparative six-month periods due to a $40.0 million ($26.4 million after tax) increase in the reserve for uncollectible receivables. Without the write down of the trade receivable, consolidated net income for the first six months of fiscal 2005 improved over the same period a year ago for the same reasons identified above for the second quarter.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2005 second quarter net sales were $374.9 million versus $357.8 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 5%. The increase resulted from improved pricing and a mix of engine shipments that favored higher priced products. Engine unit shipments were flat between quarters. Sales for the first half of fiscal 2005 were $629.0 million versus $592.2 million in the prior year, a 6% improvement. The factors contributing to the increase are the same as those described for the second quarter, although engine shipment units were down approximately 2% for the first six months of fiscal 2005 as compared to the same period a year ago.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $14.5 million, down $20.9 million from the same period in the prior year. The major reason for the decrease in income from operations was the $30 million write down of the trade receivable. Without the write down, income from operations improved over the same period a year ago. Favorable factors affecting the second quarter results were the improvement in revenues from our selling price increases and a sales mix that favored higher margined product. Material and component costs continue at levels significantly higher than last year, but were more than offset by the favorable factors in the second quarter.
 
Income from operations for the first half of fiscal 2005 was $9.9 million, down $28.9 million from the same period a year ago. The major reason for the decrease in income from operations was the $40 million write down of the trade receivable. Without the write down, income from operations improved over the same period a year ago. Favorable factors affecting the results for the first six months were the improvement in revenues from our selling price increases, a sales mix that favored higher margined product and increased production levels, primarily in the first quarter, which allowed for a better spreading of fixed costs. As in the second quarter, material and component costs were significantly higher than last year.
Power Products:
 
Fiscal 2005 second quarter net sales were $170.6 million, a $73.0 million increase over the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of having $72.4 million of sales from our Simplicity acquisition. Generator sales were up approximately 15%, primarily because of unit volume resulting from continuing replenishment of retail inventories that were depleted by the active hurricane season. Pressure washer sales were down approximately 13% because of a unit volume decrease. Retail sales of pressure washers increased year over year, but our shipments of pressure washer units declined as retailers lowered their inventories in anticipation of new product offerings in the spring.
 
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 were $392.9 million, a $169.7 million increase over the same period a year ago. A major factor in the increase was the inclusion of $151.9 million of net sales from our Simplicity acquisition. Generator product accounted for the rest of the increase, with sales up approximately 23% because of unit volume increases associated with the significant hurricane season. The generator increase was offset by a pressure washer sales decrease of approximately 15%. As previously discussed, unit volume reductions described above account for a majority of the decline.
 
There was a loss from operations of $.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, a decline of $5.8 million from the gain of $5.2 million a year ago. The major factor for the decline was a $4.0 million operating loss associated with the Simplicity acquisition. The loss is the result of the application of purchase accounting rules that increased the cost of sales by $4.6 million. The remainder of the decline was primarily due to increased costs associated with premium freight to satisfy retail demand for generators, increased material and component costs and lower production volumes for pressure washers that had an unfavorable impact on the spreading of fixed costs.
 
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2005 was $4.5 million, a reduction of $10.0 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. One factor for the decline was a $4.8 million operating loss associated with the Simplicity acquisition. As in the second quarter, the operating loss at Simplicity is the result of purchase accounting rules on acquired inventory that have increased the cost of sales by $9.6 million for the six-month period. The remainder of the decline was caused by the same factors discussed for the second quarter, in addition to lower unit prices on pressure washers, the majority of which occurred in the first quarter.
 
General:
 
Other income was greater in both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 due to the recognition of dividends on preferred stock that we hold. The effective tax rate is approximately 34% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 versus the 32% used in the corresponding periods last year.
 
Other Matters:
 
We have made an offer of $125.0 million for all tangible and intangible assets, excluding real estate, of the North American operations of Murray, Inc. As of January 21, 2005 Murray, Inc. has not yet received approval of the sale by the bankruptcy court. If all required approvals are received within the next two weeks we anticipate completion of the transaction by mid March. We estimate that we will record an extraordinary gain in the range of $20.0 to $30.0 million in the second half of fiscal 2005. We believe our net income will be $3.0 to $5.0 million lower as we absorb some of the operating losses of Murray, Inc. while they produce finished goods that we will sell to retailers for the upcoming lawn and garden season.
 
Outlook:
 
We are adjusting our forecast of net income for fiscal 2005 to incorporate the incremental $30.0 million trade receivable written down in the second quarter, our estimate of the operating loss associated with the Murray asset acquisition and our estimate of the potential extraordinary gain. Consequently, we have changed our previous net income forecast of $150 to $160 million to a range of $143 to $160 million. In addition, we continue to address the cost increases that we are seeing on raw materials and components, and we do not believe there is any significant relief from the levels we are currently experiencing, other than the impact of price increases implemented to date.
 
We project that third quarter net sales will be approximately 30% greater than last year, while net income could improve in the range of 13% to 15%.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On January 25, 2005, Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC and Briggs & Stratton Canada, Inc., which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Briggs & Stratton Corporation, (collectively "Briggs") executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA") with Murray, Inc. and Murray Canada Co. (collectively "Murray").
 
Asset Purchase Agreement
 
The APA provides for the purchase by Briggs of substantially all of the Murray assets in the United States and Canada, excluding real estate located in the United States, for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million. The final closing of this transaction remains subject to, among other things, approval by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (the "Bankruptcy Court"), which is overseeing Murray's reorganization under Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
 
The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing on the APA for January 31, 2005. The APA contains customary representations, warranties and closing conditions, and provides that the purchase price of $125 million is subject to adjustment for the Murray working capital at closing.
 
Transition Supply Agreement
 
In a transition supply agreement ("TSA") attached to the APA, Briggs has the right after the closing to purchase finished lawn, garden and snow products from Murray.
 
Under the anticipated terms of the TSA, Murray will provide Briggs finished goods for a period of up to eighteen (18) months following the closing of the APA. Briggs will be Murray's sole customer following the closing of the APA.The price which Briggs will pay for the finished goods purchased under the TSA is generally the cost incurred by Murray in producing those goods. The TSA provides that Briggs will make purchase price advances to Murray on a monthly basis. These advances in turn will be used by Murray to produce finished goods for Briggs. Upon termination or expiration of the term of the TSA, if Murray does not elect to continue its business, Briggs will be obligated to remit to Murray a termination payment to fund certain unrecovered costs of Murray incurred by Murray during its period of operation under the TSA. The termination payment would also fund certain wind-down costs and expenses incurred by Murray as a result of the termination or expiration of the TSA.

The Administrative Agent and any Lender Party may from time to time, without notice to the undersigned (or any of them), assign or transfer any or all of the Liabilities or any interest therein; and, notwithstanding any such assignment or transfer or any subsequent assignment or transfer thereof, such Liabilities shall be and remain Liabilities for the purposes of this Guaranty, and each and every immediate and successive assignee or transferee of any of the Liabilities or of any interest therein shall, to the extent of the interest of such assignee or transferee in the Liabilities, be entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty to the same extent as if such assignee or transferee were a Lender Party.
 
No delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy; nor shall any modification or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered on behalf of the Administrative Agent (or, if at any time there is no Administrative Agent, the Required Banks or, if required pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement, all Banks). No action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party or the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005
 
MILWAUKEE, WI April 21, 2005/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2005 third quarter consolidated net sales of $840.5 million and consolidated net income of $80.6 million or $1.56 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2004 had consolidated net sales of $654.7 million and consolidated net income of $71.3 million or $1.44 per diluted share. The consolidated net sales increase of $185.8 million or 28% was primarily due to the inclusion of $108.2 million of net sales from the Simplicity Manufacturing, Inc. ("Simplicity") acquisition in July of 2004 and the inclusion of $71.9 million of net sales of lawn and garden equipment as a result of the acquisition of selected assets of the bankrupt Murray, Inc. ("Murray") in February of 2005. Consolidated net income increased $9.4 million between years. Third quarter consolidated net income benefited from the recognition of an extraordinary gain of $30 million ($19.8 million after the tax effects of the transaction) related to the difference between the purchase price and the estimated realizable value of the Murray assets. The decrease in consolidated net income for the quarter, excluding the benefit of the extraordinary gain, was due to the impact of increased spending on raw materials and other manufacturing costs and lower production volume in the Engines segment which was offset in part by improvement in sales volume and a more favorable exchange rate on Euro denominated engine sales.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the Company had consolidated net sales of $1,783.2 million and consolidated net income of $86.2 million or $1.66 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1,402.1 million, and consolidated net income was $95.9 million or $1.97 per diluted share. The $381.1 million or 27% increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of $260.1 million of net sales from Simplicity, the inclusion of $71.9 million of net sales of Murray product and the strong generator sales that were experienced in the first half of the year. The nine-month consolidated net income was lower by $9.7 million. The after tax difference between the write-off of the trade receivable from Murray in the first half of the year and the extraordinary gain recognized in the third quarter accounts for $5.9 million of the decrease. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to the same factors discussed for the third quarter, except on a year to date basis lower production volume was primarily a Power Products segment factor.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal third quarter net sales were $604.9 million versus $581.9 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $23.0 million or 4%. The improvement in net sales was the result of a 12% engine unit shipment increase over the same period a year ago ($55.6 million) and a revenue improvement from favorable exchange rates on Euro denominated engine sales ($11.6 million). Offsetting the increased unit and Euro benefit was an engine mix that favored lower priced product ($27.4 million), a lower volume of service parts and component sales ($13.4 million) and an increase in sales incentives over the same period a year ago. The engine mix and sales incentive impacts were the expected reversal from the favorable mix that occurred in the first half of the year and the timing of sales incentives as they relate to selected sales. Service parts and component sales were lower than anticipated in the third quarter due to the distribution network lowering their inventories in the third quarter.
 
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were $1,233.9 million versus $1,174.1 million in the prior year, an improvement of $59.7 million or 5%. The main drivers for the net sales increase were an engine unit shipment increase of 4% ($39.5 million) and a favorable price and Euro impact ($32.5 million). Offsetting the increases were lower service parts and component sales ($12.8 million), primarily in the third quarter.
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $85.5 million, down $24.5 million from $110.0 million during the same period in the prior year. The major contributors to the decrease were increased raw material and purchased component costs ($16.3 million), increases in overhead costs and operating expenses such as employee benefits and utilities ($6.7 million), the impact of lower production volumes ($6.2 million) and an unfavorable mix of shipments to lower priced, lower margined engines ($3.0 million). The decreases were partially offset by the increase in sales volume and the Euro impact described above.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 was $95.4 million, down $53.3 million from $148.7 million during the same period a year ago. The most significant reason for the decrease was the write-off of the trade receivable from Murray ($38.9 million). The write-off was recorded against income from operations in the first half of the year, however the gain recognized on the acquisition of Murray assets in the third quarter ($30.0 million) is recorded as an extraordinary gain that is not included in income from operations. The other major contributor to the decrease in
 
income from operations is higher raw material and purchased component costs incurred to date ($35.6 million). The primary offset to the decreases in income from operations is the benefit received from the favorable Euro impact and price increases.
 
Power Products:
 
Fiscal third quarter net sales were $323.7 million versus $125.6 million from the same period a year ago, an increase of $198.0 million. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the inclusion of $108.2 million of net sales from our Simplicity acquisition and $71.9 million of net sales from our Murray asset acquisition. The remaining improvement was the result of pressure washer and generator unit volume increases. Pressure washer net sales increased 17%, while unit volume increased 29%. Volume grew because of retail inventory build-up of redesigned product in anticipation of spring and summer consumer demand and the placement of incremental SKU's at retail. The difference between unit and dollar sales growth is mix that favored smaller, lower priced units. Generator net sales increased 15%, while unit volume increased 12%. Generator demand continues to be strong due to continued replenishment of inventory following the power outages caused by the major hurricane activity in our fiscal first quarter. The difference between dollar and unit sales growth reflects pricing changes instituted in January of 2005.
 
Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were $714.9 million versus $348.8 million in the prior year, a $366.1 million or 105% increase. As in the third quarter, the increase in net sales was primarily the result of the inclusion of net sales from our Simplicity and Murray acquisitions of $260.1 million and $71.9 million, respectively. The remaining improvement is basically the result of a generator net sales increase of 21% supported by a unit volume of the same percentage. The generator volume increase resulted from the strong hurricane activity in the first quarter. Pressure washer unit volume is up 9% between years but a mix shift to smaller, lower priced units resulted in a net sales gain of 4%.
 
Income from operations was $14.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, an improvement of $7.4 million over the same period a year ago. The Simplicity acquisition accounts for $3.4 million of this increase, while the Murray acquisition is breakeven due to the impact of purchase accounting. The remainder of the improvement was experienced on the generator and pressure washer products. Lower spending on manufacturing costs and operating expenses, increased prices and increased unit sales were the major factors improving income from operations.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 was $19.2 million, a decrease of $2.7 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. The Simplicity acquisition is responsible for $1.3 million of the decrease due to their operating loss through nine months. Simplicity's operating income reflects $12.1 million of expenses associated with purchase accounting on inventory and other long-term assets. The remainder of the decrease occurred in the first six months of the fiscal year when the benefit from increased generator sales volume was offset by increased manufacturing costs.
 
General:
 
Other income was greater in both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005 due to the recognition of dividends on preferred stock that we own. The effective tax rate is 34.0% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005 versus the prior year's third quarter and nine-month rates of 33.6% and 33.2%, respectively.
 
The $30.0 million ($19.8 million after the tax effects of the transaction) extraordinary gain recorded in the third quarter, resulting from the acquisition of selected Murray assets, is our preliminary estimate of the realizable value in excess of our purchase price. During the last quarter of the fiscal year we will further evaluate the realizable value of the assets. In addition, we will determine what losses might result from reimbursement of costs associated with a contract manufacturing arrangement that was part of the Murray asset acquisition. We also believe we will be able to provide guidance no later than August on what our plans will be for the Murray product line.
 
Outlook:
 
We now believe that it will not be possible to recoup or make up the incremental increases that we project for material, component and other overhead costs being experienced in fiscal 2005. Therefore, we are lowering the top end of our forecast for fiscal 2005 to reflect this assumption. We presently are forecasting consolidated net income within the range of $143 to $148 million, or $2.76 to $2.85 per diluted share.
 
For the full fiscal year consolidated net sales should approximate $2.6 billion, with Murray being approximately $200 million of the total. At this time, we continue to assume we can achieve our projected sales targets for both business segments based upon our view of inventory levels and current orders. Our estimates could be affected by the retailer's perception of consumer demand due to a variety of factors, one of which is weather. Weather at the end of the third quarter was cooler than normal and it is our understanding that retail sales of lawn and garden equipment was not at the same level as a year ago. However, there has been good moisture and our forecast assumes that the "late" spring in terms of temperature will not affect our level of product shipment.
 
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: http://www.briggsandstratton.com/shareholders .

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
MILWAUKEE, WI August 11, 2005/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2005 fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $871.7 million and consolidated net income of $50.4 million or $.98 per diluted share.  The fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 had consolidated net sales of $545.3 million and consolidated net income of $40.2 million or $.81 per diluted share.  The consolidated net sales increase of $326.4 million or 60% was basically due to the inclusion of $129.1 million of net sales from the July 2004 Simplicity Manufacturing, Inc. ("Simplicity") acquisition, the inclusion of $141.6 million of net sales of lawn and garden equipment as a result of the February 2005 acquisition of selected assets of the bankrupt Murray, Inc. ("Murray") and increased sales for the other components in the Power Products segment, primarily as a result of strong generator demand.  Consolidated net income increased $10.2 million between years.  The increase in fourth quarter consolidated net income was primarily the result of the earnings contributed by the Simplicity operations.
 
For fiscal 2005, the Company had consolidated net sales of $2,654.9 million and consolidated net income of $136.6 million or $2.63 per diluted share.  For fiscal 2004, consolidated net sales were $1,947.4 million, and consolidated net income was $136.1 million or $2.77 per diluted share.  The $707.5 million or 36% increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of $389.1 million of net sales from Simplicity, the inclusion of $213.5 million of net sales of Murray product and improved Power Products segment net sales of $101.8 million, primarily the result of increased generator volume experienced during the year.  Twelve month consolidated net income was basically the same between years.  Pricing improvements and the benefit of increased sales volume in both segments were in large part offset by the significant cost increases experienced on certain raw materials and selected manufacturing overhead categories.  In addition, the after tax difference between the write-off of the trade receivable from Murray and the extraordinary gain from the acquisition of Murray assets decreased net income by $6.2 million in fiscal 2005.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2005 fourth quarter net sales were $505.3 million versus $443.3 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $62.0 million or 14%.  The improvement in net sales was primarily the result of a 26% engine unit shipment increase over the same period a year ago offset by a mix that favored lower priced product.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2005 were $1,739.2 million versus $1,617.4 million in the prior year, an improvement of $121.8 million or 8%.  The main drivers for the net sales increase were an engine unit shipment increase of 10% and a favorable price and Euro impact.  Offsetting the engine unit and price increases was a mix that favored lower priced product and lower service parts and component sales.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $47.3 million, down $8.4 million from $55.7 million during the same period in the prior year.  The major contributors to the decrease were increased selling expenses, an unfavorable mix of shipments to lower margined engines and increased raw material and purchased component costs.  The decreases were partially offset by the increase in sales volume.
 
Income from operations for fiscal 2005 was $142.7 million, down $61.8 million from $204.5 million in fiscal 2004.  The most significant reason for the decrease was the write-off of the trade receivable from Murray ($38.9 million).  The write-off was recorded against income from operations; however, the gain recognized on the acquisition of Murray assets ($19.8 million after tax) was recorded as an extraordinary gain that is not included in income from operations.  The other major contributors to the decrease in income from operations were higher raw material and purchased component costs and increased selling expenses.  The major items that partially offset the decreases in income from operations were the favorable Euro impact, pricing improvements and an increase in engine sales volume.
 
Power Products:
 
Fiscal 2005 fourth quarter net sales were $478.7 million versus $140.5 million from the same period a year ago, an increase of $338.2 million.  A majority of the increase in net sales was the result of the inclusion of $129.1 million of net sales from our Simplicity acquisition and $141.6 million of net sales from our Murray asset acquisition.  The remaining improvement was the result of portable generator and pressure washer unit volume increases.  Portable generator net sales increased 105% on a unit volume increase of 90%.  While generator demand was strong due to continued
 
replenishment of retailers' inventory, exceptional demand was driven by consumers in Florida who responded to state legislation that provided for a tax holiday on purchases of hurricane related supplies.  Pressure washer net sales increased 16% on a unit volume increase of 20%.  Volume grew because of market growth and successful product lineups at retail.
 
Sales for fiscal 2005 were $1,193.6 million versus $489.3 million in the prior year, a $704.3 million increase.  As in the fourth quarter, the majority of the increase in net sales was the result of the inclusion of net sales from our Simplicity and Murray acquisitions of $389.1 million and $213.5 million, respectively.  The remaining improvement is primarily the result of a portable generator net sales increase of 39% supported by a unit volume increase of 35%.  The generator volume increase resulted from the strong hurricane activity in the first quarter and the exceptional fourth quarter demand discussed above.
 
Income from operations was $30.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, an improvement of $21.5 million over the same period a year ago.  The Simplicity acquisition accounted for $14.1 million of this increase, while the Murray acquisition was breakeven for the period.  The remainder of the improvement was experienced on the generator and pressure washer products.  Pricing improvement, primarily on generators, and increased unit sales were the major factors contributing to improved income from operations for the other products in this segment.
 
Income from operations for fiscal 2005 was $49.3 million, an increase of $18.8 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago.  The Simplicity acquisition is responsible for $12.8 million of the increase.  For fiscal 2005, Simplicity's operating income reflects $9.0 million of expenses associated with purchase accounting on inventory, which will not reoccur in fiscal 2006.  The remainder of the increase came from the pricing improvement and unit volume increases on the other products in the Power Products segment.
 
General:
 
Other income was greater in both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 due to the recognition of dividends on preferred stock that we own.  The effective tax rate is 31.7% for the fourth quarter and 33.0% for fiscal 2005 versus the prior year's fourth quarter and full year rates of 34.5% and 33.6%, respectively.
 
Other Matters:
 
During fiscal 2005, $3.9 million of costs related to preparing a portion of a manufacturing property to be saleable were recorded in cost of goods sold.  It was anticipated that the property would be sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, under an agreement, for a gain of approximately $6.8 million.  Because of unresolved contingencies in the agreement at the fiscal year end, the transaction could not close as planned, and it is now projected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
Outlook:
 
For fiscal 2006, we estimate that diluted earnings per share should be in the range of $3.17 to $3.27.  The estimate is based on the assumption that consolidated net sales will grow 3.0% to 3.5% between years with overall volumes being relatively flat.  Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 9.0% to 10.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $38.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be 33.0%.
 
The forecast for fiscal 2006 does not contain significant sales of Murray branded product.  In fiscal 2005, the bankrupt estate of Murray, Inc. produced Murray branded product that we sold to retailers under pre-bankruptcy arrangements.  At this time, we know operations at Murray, Inc. will end in September 2005.  We are pursuing arrangements with other original equipment manufacturers to produce Murray branded product.  In addition, retailers are still reviewing their 2006 lines, so it is too early to determine which retailers, if any, will commit to buy product from us for the upcoming lawn and garden season.  Consequently, we have included in our projections only sales of Murray branded powered product that we believe will be produced through September 2005.

APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.
ITEM 5.02.   DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS;
 
(c) . On August 10, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Corporation appointed Todd J. Teske as Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of the Corporation effective September 1, 2005.
Appointment of Principal Officers
 
Mr. Teske served as Senior Vice President and President  Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC from September 2003 through August 2005, Vice President and President  Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC from February 2003 through August 2003, Vice President  Corporate Development from March 2001 through January 2003, and Controller from October 1998 through February 2001.  Mr. Teske is 40 years old.
 
Mr. Teske has a twoyear employment agreement with the Corporation and an annual salary of $450,000 in his new position. The agreement automatically extends for an additional year upon each anniversary date unless either party gives a 30day notice prior to the anniversary date
that the agreement will not be renewed. Under the agreement, Mr. Teske agrees to perform the duties currently being performed in addition to other duties that may be assigned from time to time. The Corporation agrees to pay Mr. Teske a salary of not less than that of the previous year and to provide fringe benefits that are provided to all other salaried employees of the Corporation in comparable positions. In the event of a termination other than for cause, Mr. Teske's salary and fringe benefits (but not bonus or long-term incentive compensation) are continued for the remaining term of the agreement.

Exhibit 10.1
 
As Amended and Restated
Effective 08-09-05
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.0
                                
Objectives
 
The Premium Option and Stock Award Program ("POSA Program") is designed to build upon the Company's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation Plan ("EVA Plan") by tying the interests of all Senior Executives to the long term consolidated results of the Company.  In this way, the objectives of Senior Executives throughout the Company will be more closely aligned with the Company's Shareholders.  Whereas the EVA Plan provides for near and intermediate term rewards, the POSA Program provides a longer term focus by allowing Senior Executives to participate in the long-term appreciation in the equity value of the Company.  In general, the POSA Program is structured such that each year an amount equivalent to the Total Bonus Payout under the EVA Plan is invested on behalf of Senior Executives in restricted and/or deferred shares of the Company's Stock ("Restricted and/or Deferred Stock") and an amount equivalent to the Senior Executive's Target Incentive Award is invested in premium options on the Company's Stock ("PSOs").  The shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock vest five years after their date of grant.  The PSOs vest and become exercisable after they have been held for three years, and they expire at the end of five years.  The PSOs are structured so that a fair return must be provided to the Company's Shareholders before they become valuable.
 
2.0
                                
Restricted and/or Deferred Stock Awards
 
For fiscal 2005 and subsequent years, the dollar amount to be invested in Restricted and/or Deferred Stock for each Senior Executive shall be equal to the amount of each Participant's Total Bonus Payout determined under the EVA Plan.  The number of shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock awarded shall be determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount of such Restricted and/or Deferred Stock award by (b) the Fair Market Value of Company Stock on the date of grant as determined by the Committee, rounded (up or down) to the nearest 10 shares.  Fair Market Value is defined in the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan ("ICP").
 
The Compensation Committee shall determine whether stock awards shall consist of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock or a mix of each type of stock, and may consider each Senior Executive's preference in making such determination.  All shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant regardless of whether such vesting date occurs before or after retirement and shall have such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
 
3.0
                                
Premium Stock Option Awards
 
For fiscal 2005 and subsequent years, the dollar amount to be invested in PSOs for each Senior Executive shall be equal to the amount of each Participant's Target Incentive Award determined under the EVA Plan.  The number of PSOs awarded shall be determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount of such PSO award by (b) the Black-Scholes value of a share of Company stock based on its Fair Market Value on the date of the grant as determined by the Committee, rounded (up or down) to the nearest 10 shares.  Fair Market Value is defined in the ICP.
All PSOs shall vest and be exercisable beginning on the third anniversary of the date of grant and shall terminate on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant unless sooner exercised, unless the Committee determines other dates.
 
The exercise price for PSOs shall be 110% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Company's Stock on the date of grant.
 
4.0
                                
Limitations on Grants and Carryover
 
Notwithstanding Sections 2 and 3, the maximum number of shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock that may be granted to all Senior Executives for any Plan Year shall be 500,000, and the maximum number of PSOs that may be granted to all Senior Executives for any Plan Year shall be 730,000.  In the event that the limitations shall be in effect for any Plan Year, the dollar amount to be invested for each Senior Executive shall be reduced by proration based on the aggregate Total Bonus Payouts or Target Incentive Awards of all Senior Executives so that the limitations are not exceeded.  The amount of any such reduction shall be carried forward to subsequent years and invested in Restricted and/or Deferred Stock or PSOs to the extent the annual limitation is not exceeded in such years.
 
5.0
                                
The Incentive Compensation Plan
 
Except as modified herein, PSOs are Incentive Stock Options under the Company's ICP as amended from time to time to the extent they are eligible for treatment as such under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.  If not eligible for ISO treatment, the PSOs shall constitute nonqualified stock options.  Except as specifically modified herein, PSOs shall be governed by the terms of the Company's ICP, and shall be granted as described in this Program annually unless the Committee modifies or terminates either the EVA Plan or the ICP.  As provided in the ICP, all grants of PSOs to Participants who are subject to Sec. 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are subject to approval of the Company Shareholders.  In the event such approval is not obtained, this Program shall terminate.
 
6.0
                                
Definitions
 
All capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning given to them in the Company's EVA Plan and ICP.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced first quarter consolidated net sales of $511.7 million and net income of $4.7 million or $.09 per diluted share.  Consolidated net sales increased $72.7 million or 17% over the prior year while net income increased $6.2 million over the same period a year ago. 
 
The $72.7 million consolidated net sales increase was primarily due to the inclusion of sales of end product associated with our acquisition of the assets of Murray, Inc. ("Murray"), which was completed in February of 2005.
 
The $6.2 million improvement in net income reflects that last year's fiscal first quarter results contain a $10.0 million ($6.4 million after tax) expense for an increase in the reserve for uncollectible receivables.  In addition, the fiscal 2006 first quarter results reflect a $6.4 million ($4.2 million after tax) gain on the sale of a manufacturing property.  Offsets to the major items that improved net income were increased operating costs related to fringe benefits (i.e., health care, pension and stock option costs) and wind down expenses associated with the exit of the Transition Services Agreement ("TSA") made in conjunction with the Murray transaction.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2006 first quarter net sales were $285.4 million, a $31.3 million or 12% improvement over the prior year.  This increase is primarily due to increased unit shipments to Europe for lawn equipment and generator manufacturers for portable generators.
 
Income from operations was $8.8 million, an increase of $13.4 million from the loss reported for the same period a year ago.  The decrease in the bad debt expense between years and this year's gain on the sale of the manufacturing property were two major factors in the improvement.  Operationally, the increased margin on strong engine sales was offset primarily by increased fringe benefit costs, higher than anticipated transportation costs and planned increases for professional services.
 
Power Products:
 
First quarter net sales were $300.6 million, a $78.5 million or 35% increase over the same period a year ago.  The increase in net sales was the result of having $79.9 million of sales related to lawn and snow equipment produced by Murray under the TSA.  Generator sales were positively impacted by two hurricanes in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, but the increase was offset by the combination of lower pressure washer unit sales and significantly lower unit sales of premium lawn and garden equipment.  Premium lawn and garden equipment decreases were caused by low replenishment due to higher dealer inventories in certain areas of the country where retail sales for the past season were hampered by dry weather conditions.
 
Income from operations was $.1 million, a decrease of $5.0 million or 97% from the prior year.  Operating income on generators and pressure washers improved over 50% between years driven by improved revenue per unit, better utilization of the assets producing generators and pressure washers and increased generator volume.  Volume for premium lawn and garden equipment was lower for both units shipped and produced, increasing the first quarter loss related to these products. Finally, the major factor for the decline in operating income between years was the cost of effectively closing down operations under the TSA arrangement with Murray.  The Murray related operations negatively impacted the first quarter operating income by $8.2 million.
 
General:
 
Interest expense was higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 because outstanding debt was higher than last year.  The effective tax rate is at 35% versus the 36% used in the first quarter last year.
 
Outlook:
 
At this time, we are not changing the outlook for fiscal 2006 that we provided in August 2005.  While the Power Products Segment has seen more strength in portable generators than originally anticipated, it has also experienced greater costs than planned to affect the shut down of the Murray operations.  In addition, the status of orders for the
Engine Segment's business is later in developing this year because retailers are making their product line-up decisions later this year.
 
We project that second quarter fiscal 2006 consolidated net sales will be approximately $560 million and operating margins are estimated to be near 7.2%.  The effective tax rate is estimated at 35.0%.  Our forecast for net income is $.44 per diluted share.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Briggs & Stratton today announced second quarter fiscal 2006 consolidated net sales of $574.3 million and consolidated net income of $21.8 million or $.42 per diluted share.  The second quarter of fiscal 2005 had consolidated net sales of $503.7 million and net income of $7.1 million or $.14 per diluted share.  The majority of the $70.6 million, or 14%, increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of $63.4 million of sales of end product associated with our acquisition of certain assets of Murray, Inc. ("Murray"), which was completed in February of 2005.  Consolidated net income increased $14.7 million between years.  The improvement reflects that last year's second quarter results contained a $30.0 million ($19.8 million after tax) expense for a bad debt expense.  Without the effect of the bad debt expense, consolidated net income for the second quarter was lower this year than in the same period a year ago.  The reduction was due to increased professional fees and fringe benefits, primarily in the Engines Segment.
 
For the first six months of fiscal 2006, the Company had consolidated net sales of $1.086 billion and consolidated net income of $26.5 million or $.51 per diluted share.  For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $942.7 million and consolidated net income was $5.6 million or $.11 per diluted share.  All of the $143.3 million or 15% increase in consolidated net sales was due to the inclusion of sales from the Murray acquisition.  Consolidated net income increased $20.9 million over the same period a year ago.  The improvement reflects that the results for the first six months of fiscal 2005 contained a $40.0 million ($26.4 million after tax) expense for a bad debt and the first six months of fiscal 2006 had a $6.4 million ($4.2 million after tax) gain on the sale of a manufacturing property.  Without the effect of the bad debt and property sale, consolidated net income for the first six months of fiscal 2006 was lower than in the same period a year ago for the same reasons identified above for the second quarter.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2006 second quarter net sales were $380.9 million versus $374.9 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 2%.  The increase resulted from a 4% increase in engine unit shipments between quarters that were partially offset by a mix of product that favored lower priced units.  Sales for the first half of fiscal 2006 were $666.3 million versus $629.0 million in the prior year, a 6% improvement.  The factors contributing to the increase are the same as those described for the second quarter, with engine unit shipments being up 9% for the first six months of fiscal 2006.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $35.7 million, up $21.2 million from the same period in the prior year.  The major reason for the increase in income from operations was the absence of the prior year's $30.0 million bad debt expense.  Without the bad debt expense, income from operations was lower than the same period a year ago.  The benefit from the unit volume increase and ongoing cost improvement projects was offset by a mix of shipments that favored lower margined product and increased expenses for professional fees and employee fringe benefits, primarily pension and stock option related.
 
Income from operations for the first half of fiscal 2006 was $44.5 million, up $34.6 million from the same period a year ago.  The major reason for the increase in income from operations was the absence of the prior year's $40.0 million bad debt expense offset, by the same factors described above.
 
Power Products:
 
Fiscal 2006 second quarter net sales were $256.6 million, an $87.5 million increase over the same period a year ago.  A majority of the increase in net sales was the result of adding $63.4 million of sales from the Murray asset acquisition.  The remainder of the increase was primarily generator sales resulting from continued replenishment of retail inventories that were depleted by the active hurricane season.
 
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2006 were $557.2 million, a $166.0 million increase over the same period a year ago.  A majority of the increase in net sales was the result of adding $143.4 million of sales from the Murray acquisition.  The remaining increase is the result of strong generator product shipments associated with the significant hurricane season and the resulting replenishment demand offset by lower first quarter 2006 premium lawn and garden equipment sales.
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $5.6 million, up $6.2 million from the same period in the prior year.  The majority of the improvement was driven by higher sales and production volume for generator product.  In addition, operating income improved on premium lawn and garden equipment, primarily due to the absence of purchasing accounting adjustments in fiscal 2006.  Offsetting these improvements was $2.5 million in losses associated with the wind down of operations at Murray.
 
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2006 was $5.7 million, an increase of $1.2 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago.  Operating income improved $11.9 million as a result of higher sales and production volumes for generator product, offset by $10.7 million in expenses associated with the wind down of Murray.  Through six months, operating losses associated with premium lawn and garden equipment are essentially flat.
 
General:
 
Interest expense was higher in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2006 because outstanding debt was higher than last year.  The second quarter and year to date effective tax rate is at 35% versus the 34% used in the comparable periods last year.
 
Other Matters:
 
We intend to reduce salaried headcount by a range of 6% to 8% by February 15, 2006.  Our goal is to streamline our operations to reflect organizational and workflow changes that have occurred over the last several years.  We believe the reduction will result in approximately $10 to $15 million of annual, pretax savings beginning in fiscal 2007.
 
Outlook:
 
We are adjusting our forecasts of net income for fiscal 2006 to incorporate both today's announcement of the headcount reduction, but more importantly our current assessment of the direction of our business for the 2006 lawn and garden season.  At the start of the fiscal year we indicated that engine volume would be flat between years and we would pursue price increases to offset the increased costs of raw materials and components.  We now forecast that unit volume will be down from last year 1% to 2% in response to the price increase.  An additional response to the price increase has been to power lawn and garden equipment with lower priced, smaller displacement engines that will create a mix issue that has an impact on both the top and bottom line results.  These changes to our engine shipment and production projections now result in the change in consolidated net sales being approximately 4% for the year and a current net income forecast for the year in a range of $144 to $150 million, or $2.75 to $2.87 per diluted share.
 
We project that third quarter consolidated net sales will be approximately 3% greater than last year, while net income is projected to be $67 million or $1.28 per diluted share.  These results reflect a negative impact of $ .03 per diluted share related to the global workforce reduction.  For fiscal 2006 the impact of the workforce reduction is projected to be neutral to net income.
 
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (EST) on January 19, 2006 to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on its corporate website: http://www.briggsandstratton.com/shareholders.

Exhibit 99.1
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006
 
MILWAUKEE, WI April 20, 2006/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2006 third quarter consolidated net sales of $800.2 million and consolidated net income of $60.0 million or $1.16 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2005 had consolidated net sales of $840.5 million and consolidated net income of $80.6 million or $1.56 per diluted share. The consolidated net sales decrease of $40.3 million or 5% is primarily due to a $44.4 million reduction in net sales of Murray related lawn and garden equipment. Consolidated net income decreased $20.6 million between years. The decrease is primarily because last year's third quarter consolidated net income benefited from the recognition of an extraordinary gain of $19.8 million, net of tax.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2006, the Company had consolidated net sales of $1,886.2 million and consolidated net income of $86.6 million or $1.67 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1,783.2 million, and consolidated net income was $86.2 million or $1.66 per diluted share. The $103.0 million or 6% increase in consolidated net sales is primarily due to the $98.9 million increase in net sales of Murray related product in fiscal 2006. The Murray assets were acquired in February of fiscal 2005. The nine-month consolidated net income was higher by $0.4 million.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal third quarter net sales were $597.6 million versus $604.9 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $7.3 million or 1%. The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of a 6% engine unit shipment decline from the same period a year ago that reflects the shift of engine shipments from the third to the second quarter in fiscal 2006, with unit shipments up 1% through nine months. Offsetting the third quarter decreased unit shipments was an engine mix that favored higher priced product and a net improvement in unit pricing which reflected gains on domestically sold product offset by the impact of an unfavorable Euro exchange rate on European sold product.
 
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 were $1,263.9 million versus $1,233.9 million in the prior year, an improvement of $30.0 million or 2%. The main drivers for the net sales increase were an engine unit shipment increase of 1% and a mix that favored higher priced product. Current year pricing initiatives went into effect late in the second quarter as a result, they have less of an impact on the nine month results.
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which includes a $2.7 million expense for a previously announced reduction in salaried headcount, was $88.8 million, up $3.3 million from $85.5 million during the same period in the prior year. The improvement is attributable to ongoing cost reduction programs as well as a favorable mix of shipments of higher margined engines. The improvements to operating income were partially offset by increased legal and professional fees, stock option expensing, severance costs and lower sales volume.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 was $133.3 million, up $37.9 million from $95.4 million during the same period a year ago. The major reason for the increase in income from operations was the absence of the prior year's $38.9 million bad debt expense. The year to date benefit of cost reduction programs, the gain associated with a first quarter property sale and increased sales volume were offset by increases in employee benefit costs, legal and professional fees, lower production volumes, and the impact of the previously announced reduction in salary headcount.
 
Power Products:
 
Fiscal 2006 third quarter net sales were $287.8 million versus $323.7 million from the same period a year ago, a decrease of $35.9 million. The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the reduction of our sales of Murray related lawn and garden equipment. The Murray related product did not have as much market placement as it did a year ago. Premium lawn equipment sold better than last year. Generator net sales increased 21% due to strong pre-hurricane season retail stocking, while pressure washer net sales decreased 28% on a slow start to the spring retail season.
 
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 were $845.0 million versus $714.9 million in the prior year, a $130.1 million increase. The majority of the increase resulted from the sales of Murray related product because of the Company's longer ownership of the brand in fiscal 2006. The remaining improvement is basically the result of a generator net sales increase of 25% due to strong storm activity earlier in the year and increased stocking in anticipation of the 2006 hurricane season. The generator increase more than offsets a pressure washer net sales decrease of 18%.
Income from operations was $14.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, essentially flat between years. Operating income improved $9.3 million due to higher utilization of the manufacturing facilities that produce generators and premium lawn equipment and the elimination of the impact of purchase accounting in the current year. However, the improvement was offset by higher material costs and lower sales and an increase in expenses associated with lawn equipment for the mass market.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 was $20.2 million, an increase of $1.0 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. Generators and premium lawn equipment products generated approximately $13.0 million of operating income improvement through price improvement, facilities utilization and mix that was greater than the related material cost increases. However, as in the quarter, the benefit was offset by the wind down of operations associated with lawn and snow equipment for the mass market.
 
General:
 
Other income was less in the fiscal 2006 third quarter due to the timing of receipt of dividends. Interest expense is greater in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006 due to the addition of a term loan in February of 2005. The effective tax rate is 32.4% for the third quarter and 33.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 versus the prior year's third quarter and nine-month rates of 34.0%.
 
The $19.8 million extraordinary gain recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 resulted from the acquisition of selected Murray assets.
 
During the third quarter, the Company purchased 750 thousand shares in the open market, as part of a share repurchase approved by the Board of Directors. The average purchase price was $35.24 per share resulting in share repurchases totaling $26.6 million.
 
Outlook:
 
The third quarter sales of our Power Products segment were lower than anticipated and our fourth quarter projections do not anticipate recovering the lost sales. The operating costs associated with the Power Products segment were also greater than planned in the third quarter and we now expect that condition to exist through the fourth quarter. In addition, our current estimates could be affected by the retailer's perception of consumer demand due to a variety of factors. It is our understanding that retail sales of lawn and garden equipment has not been at the same level as a year ago so we now are forecasting that our engine shipments for the year will be 1% lower than anticipated in our last forecast. Consequently, our outlook on consolidated net income for the full fiscal year is now in the range of $132 to $135 million, or $2.56 to $2.62 per diluted share.
 
The Company anticipates capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $70.0 million and it will complete its previously announced share repurchase by June of 2006. In addition, during the fourth quarter the Company anticipates repaying approximately $90.0 million of the term loan that was used to acquire Murray assets in February of 2005.
 
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: http://www.briggsandstratton.com/shareholders . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 227-1607. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week. Dial (888) 266-2081 to access the replay. The pass code will be 880975.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS SOFTER FOURTH QUARTER SALES FOR FISCAL 2006
MILWAUKEE, WI July 18, 2006/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2006 fourth quarter consolidated net sales are softer than anticipated.
Fourth quarter net sales for the Engine Segment were approximately 18% lower than projected on lower than forecasted unit volume of approximately 23%.  The decrease in units in the fiscal fourth quarter resulted in fiscal 2006 engine shipments that were approximately 8% lower than fiscal 2005.  This decrease between years is due to lower shipments of engines to lawn and garden equipment manufacturers and is consistent with current industry forecasts that indicate the shipments of mowing equipment by original equipment manufacturers will be down 7-8% for the 2006 season.  The forecasted decline is being attributed to early spring weather patterns compounded by consumers pulling back from discretionary purchases due to higher interest rates, increased gasoline prices, and retailer inventory management programs to address these issues.
In the Power Products Segment, fourth quarter net sales were also lower than projected by approximately 18%.  This was the result of lower than projected unit volumes for lawn and garden equipment and pressure washer product.  We believe that the decreases are a result of the consumer pull back discussed above.  Generator product shipments were in line with our forecast.
The decrease in projected fourth quarter sales of approximately $125 million and the reduction in production activity in both Segments to offset the sales declines and reduce inventory buildup, impacts our outlook on consolidated net income for the full 2006 fiscal year.  We now anticipate that fiscal 2006 net income will be in the range of $100 to $103 million, or $1.94 to $1.99 per diluted share.
Briggs & Stratton expects to release its fiscal 2006 fourth quarter results on August 10, 2006 before the market opens.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2006 fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $656.0 million and consolidated net income of $15.8 million or $.31 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 had consolidated net sales of $871.7 million and consolidated net income of $50.4 million or $.98 per diluted share. The consolidated net sales decrease of $215.7 million or 25% was due to a $120.5 million or 24% decrease in the Engines Segment's net sales and a $138.2 million or 29% decrease in the Power Products Segment's net sales. The $34.6 million decline in fourth quarter consolidated net income was primarily the result of decreased shipment volumes experienced across both operating segments.
 
For fiscal 2006, the Company had consolidated net sales of $2,542.2 million and consolidated net income of $102.3 million or $1.98 per diluted share. For fiscal 2005, consolidated net sales were $2,654.9 million, and consolidated net income was $136.6 million or $2.63 per diluted share. The $112.7 million or 4% decrease in consolidated net sales was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of engine shipments. Fiscal 2006 consolidated net income decreased $34.2 million or 25% from the previous year. Pricing improvements in both operating segments were offset by decreased shipping volumes, primarily in the Engines Segment, increased legal and professional fees, stock option expensing and expenses associated with the termination of operations and liquidation of assets acquired from Murray, Inc.
 
Engines:
 
Fiscal 2006 fourth quarter net sales were $384.8 million versus $505.3 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $120.5 million or 24%. The reduction in net sales was primarily the result of a 30% engine unit shipment decrease over the same period a year ago. We believe the decrease in unit shipments was the result of softer retail demand for lawn and garden equipment and efforts by retailers to maintain reasonable inventory levels in the distribution channels at the end of the selling season. The impact of the volume reduction was partially offset by improvements in pricing implemented at the start of the fiscal year.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $1,648.2 million versus $1,739.2 million in the prior year, a decrease of $91.0 million or 5%. The principal factor contributing to the net sales decrease was the fourth quarter engine unit shipment decrease described above, which caused the fiscal 2006 shipments to be 7% less than the prior year.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $16.5 million, down $30.8 million from $47.3 million during the same period in the prior year. The major factor contributing to the decline was reduced engine unit shipments. The shipment decline also resulted in lower utilization of the operating facilities as production levels were reduced to manage our engine inventories. However, more favorable pricing and a gain on the sale of a facility offset the cost of lower production.
 
Income from operations for fiscal 2006 was $149.8 million, up $7.1 million from $142.7 million in fiscal 2005. The increase between years was the result of gains associated with certain asset sales. Pricing improvements offset the impact of lower shipment volumes and savings from cost reduction programs offset the unfavorable impact of lower utilization of the operating facilities and a product mix that favored units with lower margins. The absence of the prior year's $38.9 million bad debt expense was offset by increases in employee benefit costs and legal and professional fees.
 
Power Products:
 
Fiscal 2006 fourth quarter net sales were $340.5 million versus $478.7 million from the same period a year ago, a decrease of $138.2 million. A majority of the decrease in net sales was the result of the anticipated reduction of $112.9 million of sales of lawn and garden equipment to major retailers who moved away from Murray branded product for the 2006 lawn and garden season. The remainder of the net sales decrease was the result of lower shipment volumes of premium lawn and garden equipment and pressure washer product. Both product lines were affected by the lower retail demand and inventory control practices described above in the Engines Segment.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $1,186.0 million versus $1,193.6 million in the prior year, a $7.6 million decrease. The decline was the result of lower shipment volumes of lawn and garden products and pressure washers as described in the fourth quarter. Sales of generator products increased due to the strong hurricane activity during the fiscal year.
Income from operations was $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, a decrease of $20.7 million over the same period a year ago. The decrease was the result of lower sales volumes, an unfavorable mix of lawn and garden equipment sales that favored lower margined product and expenses associated with the liquidation of assets acquired from Murray, Inc.
 
Income from operations for fiscal 2006 was $29.6 million, a decrease of $19.7 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. The major reasons for the decrease were lower sales volumes and expenses associated with the termination of operations and liquidation of assets acquired from Murray, Inc.
 
General:
 
Other income was less than in the prior year for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 due to the Company's portion of lower earnings at joint ventures. The effective tax rate is 30.6% for the fourth quarter and 32.8% for fiscal 2006 versus the prior year's fourth quarter and full year rates of 31.7% and 33.0%, respectively.
 
The $19.8 million extraordinary gain recorded in fiscal 2005 resulted from the acquisition of selected Murray, Inc. assets.
 
During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased 247,000 shares of its common stock in the open market completing a one million share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. For fiscal 2006, this resulted in share repurchases totaling $34.9 million.
 
The Company repaid $99 million of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, resulting in $101 million of net long-term debt repayments for the entire fiscal year. Of the total repayments, $90 million was used to reduce the variable rate term notes due in 2008.
 
Share Repurchase Program:
 
The Company today announced that it intends to initiate repurchases of up to $120 million of its common stock through open market transactions over the next eighteen months. The timing and amount of purchases will be dependent upon the market price of the stock and certain governing loan covenants.
 
Outlook:
 
For fiscal 2007, the Company projects that net income will be in the range of $122 to $128 million or $2.43 to $2.55 per diluted share. The estimate is based on the assumption that consolidated net sales will grow 1.5% to 2.5% between years primarily due to volume. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 8.2% to 8.6%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $42.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be 33% to 35%. Fiscal 2007 first quarter consolidated net sales are projected to be in the range of $420 to $450 million. Lower first quarter sales and production schedules result in a projected net loss in the first quarter in the range of $10 to $12 million or $.20 to $.24 per diluted share.

The special meeting must be held within 90 business days after the Company receives a request from shareholders to hold such special meeting. If a resolution to redeem the Rights is approved at the special meeting by a majority of the Common Shares outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date for the Special Meeting (not giving effect to any affirmative votes cast by the offeror or any of its affiliates or associates), or if the special meeting is not held on or before the 90

RIGHTS AGREEMENT
Agreement, dated as of August 7, 1996, as amended through August 9, 2006, between Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), and National City Bank (the "Rights Agent").
The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized and declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each Common Share (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding on August 19, 1996 (the "Record Date") payable on such date, each Right representing the right to purchase one-half of one Common Share, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized and directed the issuance of one Right with respect to each Common Share that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined).
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.      Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
(a)    "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates (as such terms are hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Person who or which, at the close of business on August 7, 1996, shall have been the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding shall be deemed an "Acquiring Person"; provided, however, that, if a Person is, at the close of business on the date hereof, the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding and shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of additional Common Shares of the Company at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person"; and (ii) no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as a result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; provided, however, that if a Person would, but for the provisions of this clause (ii), become an Acquiring Person by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the
Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person", as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), has become such inadvertently, and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement.
(b)    "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
(c)    A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any securities:
(i)     which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly;
(ii)    which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has (A) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, rights (other than these Rights), warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any security if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or
(iii)   which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person with which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates
2
has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities) for the purpose of, or with respect to, acquiring, holding, voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to Section 1(c)(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this definition of Beneficial Ownership to the contrary, the phrase "then outstanding," when used with reference to a Person's Beneficial Ownership of securities of the Company, shall mean the number of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of such securities not then actually issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to own beneficially hereunder.
(d)    "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or a day on which the New York Stock Exchange or banking institutions in Wisconsin are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
(e)    "Close of business" on any given date shall mean 5:00 P.M., Milwaukee, Wisconsin time, on such date; provided, however, that if such date is not a Business Day it shall mean 5:00 P.M., Milwaukee, Wisconsin time, on the next succeeding Business Day.
(f)     "Common Shares" when used with reference to the Company shall mean the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. "Common Shares" when used with reference to any Person other than the Company shall mean the capital stock (or equity interest) with the greatest voting power of such other Person or, if such other Person is a Subsidiary of another Person, the Person or Persons which ultimately control such first-mentioned Person.
(g)    "Distribution Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3 hereof.
(h)    "Final Expiration Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 7 hereof.
(i)     "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or other entity, and shall include any successor (by merger or otherwise) of such entity.
(j)     "Qualified Offer" shall mean an offer that has, to the extent required for the type of offer specified, each of the following characteristics:
(i)     a fully financed all-cash tender offer or an exchange offer offering at least 70 percent cash and Common Shares of the offeror (with the amount of such Common Shares to be adjusted to reflect any decrease in the value of such shares prior to the consummation of the offer), in each such case for any and all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company;
(ii)    an offer that has commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act;

(iii)   an offer whose per-share offer price (A) is greater than the highest reported market price for the Common Shares of the Company during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act and (B) represents a reasonable premium above the average of the closing prices (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced, with, in the case of an offer that includes shares of Common Shares of the offeror, such per-share offer price being determined using the lower of (1) the lowest reported market price for Common Shares of the offeror during the five trading days immediately preceding and the five trading days immediately following the commencement of such offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act and (2) the average of the last sale prices (regular way) of such shares reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to such shares for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of any determination;

4
not render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company is either unfair or inadequate and such investment banking firm does not after the expiration of such 10 Business Day period render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company has become either unfair or inadequate based on a subsequent disclosure or discovery of a development or developments that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on the value of the Common Shares of the offeror;

(viii) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror that, in addition to the minimum time periods specified in item (vii) of this definition, the offer, it if is otherwise to expire prior thereto, will be extended for at least 20 Business Days after any increase in the price offered, and after any bona fide alternative offer is commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Exchange Act;
(ix)    an offer that is conditioned on a minimum of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) being tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer's expiration date, which condition shall not be waivable;

(xii)   if the offer includes Common Shares of the offeror, (A) the offeror is a publicly owned United States corporation, and its Common Shares are freely tradable and are listed or admitted to trading on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (B) no shareholder approval of the offeror is required to issue such Common Shares, or, if required, such approval has already been obtained, (C) no Person (including such Person's Affiliates and Associates) beneficially owns more than 20% of the voting stock of the offeror at the time of commencement of the offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act or at any time during the term of the offer, and (D) no other class of voting stock of the offeror is outstanding, and the offeror meets the registrant eligibility requirements for use of Form S-3 for registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including, without limitation, the filing of all required Exchange Act reports in a timely manner during the 12 calendar months prior to the date of commencement of the offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act;

6
offeror (including its Affiliates and Associates), unless another tender offer by another party for all outstanding Common Shares of the Company is commenced that (A) constitutes a Qualified Offer (in which event, any new offer by such offeror or of any of its Affiliates or Associates must be at a price no less than that provided for in such original offer) or (B) is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (in which event, any new offer by such offeror or of any of its Affiliates or Associates must be at a price no less than that provided for in such approved offer).
For the purposes of the definition of Qualified Offer, "fully financed" shall mean that the offeror has sufficient funds for the offer which shall be evidenced by (A) definitive financing agreements executed between the offeror and responsible financial institutions having the necessary financial capacity to provide funds for such offer subject only to customary terms and conditions (which shall in no event include conditions requiring access by such financial institutions to non-public information to be provided by the Company, conditions based on the accuracy of any information concerning the Company, or conditions requiring the Company to make any representations, warranties or covenants in connection with such financing), (B) cash or cash equivalents then available to the offeror, set apart and maintained solely for the purpose of funding the offer with an irrevocable written commitment being provided by the offeror to the Company to maintain such availability until the offer is consummated or withdrawn, or (C) a combination of the foregoing; which evidence (including certified copies of any such definitive financing agreements (including exhibits and related documents) and copies of all written materials prepared by the offeror for such financial institutions in connection with entering into such financing agreements) has been provided to the Company prior to, or upon, commencement of the offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act; provided that "sufficient funds for the offer" shall be an amount sufficient to pay for all Common Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis the cash portion of the consideration pursuant to the offer and the second-step transaction required by clause (x) above and all related expenses. If an offer becomes a Qualified Offer in accordance with this definition but subsequently ceases to be a Qualified Offer as a result of the failure at a later date to continue to satisfy any of the requirements of this definition, such offer shall cease to be a Qualified Offer and the provisions of Section 23(c) shall no longer be applicable to such offer, provided the actual redemption of the Rights pursuant to Section 23(c) shall not have already occurred.
(k)    "Redemption Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 7 hereof.
(l)     "Shares Acquisition Date" shall mean the first date of public announcement by the Company or an Acquiring Person that an Acquiring Person has become such.

Section 2.      Appointment of Rights Agent. The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company and the holders of the Rights (who, in accordance with Section 3 hereof, shall prior to the Distribution Date also be the holders of the Common Shares of the Company) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company may from time to time appoint such co-Rights Agents as it may deem necessary or desirable.
Section 3.      Issue of Right Certificates.
(a)    Until the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of Common Shares of the Company aggregating 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (including any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights; the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"), (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the right to receive Right Certificates will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (a "Right Certificate"), evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held. As of the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
(b)    On the Record Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Common Shares, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof. Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.
8
(c)    Certificates for Common Shares which become outstanding (including, without limitation, certificates for reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph (c) and certificates issued on the transfer of Common Shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Briggs & Stratton Corporation and National City Bank, dated as of August 7, 1996, and as such agreement may be amended (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. Briggs & Stratton Corporation will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. As described in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued to any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall become null and void.
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Shares shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.
Section 4.      Form of Right Certificates. The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase Common Shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit A hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Section 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of Common Shares as shall be set forth therein at the price per Common Share set forth therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the amount and type of securities purchasable upon exercise of each Right and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.
9
Section 5.      Countersignature and Registration.
(a)    The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, any of its Vice Presidents, or its Treasurer, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such person was not such an officer.
(b)    Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.
Section 6.      Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, at any time after the close of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of Common Shares as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the principal office of the Rights Agent. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
10
(b)    Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
Section 7.      Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights.
(a)    The registered holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the principal office of the Rights Agent, together with payment of the Purchase Price for each Common Share as to which the Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the close of business on October 18, 2009 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption Date"), or (iii) the time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof.
(b)    The Purchase Price for each Common Share purchasable pursuant to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $160, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof (including an adjustment of such price to $80 as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Common Shares effected as a 100% stock dividend effective October 29, 2004) and shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) below.
(c)    Upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof, as set forth below, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) requisition from any transfer agent of the Common Shares certificates for the number of Common Shares to be purchased and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate. The payment of the Purchase Price (as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof) shall be made in cash or by certified check, cashier's check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company, except that, if so provided by the Board of Directors of the Company, the payment of the Purchase Price following the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (as hereinafter defined) and until
11
the first occurrence of an event described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of Section 13 may be made wholly or in part by delivery of a certificate or certificates (with appropriate stock powers executed in blank attached thereto) evidencing a number of Common Shares of the Company equal to the then Purchase Price divided by the closing price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per Common Share on the Trading Day (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately preceding the date of such exercise. If the Company is obligated to issue other securities of the Company, pay cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities, cash and/or other property are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.
(d)    In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
(e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to take any action with respect to a registered holder of a Right Certificate upon the occurrence of any purported transfer, assignment or exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate following the form of assignment or election to purchase set forth on the reverse of the Right Certificate surrendered for such transfer, assignment or exercise, and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.
(f)     Prior to the time and date that an Acquiring Person becomes such, nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Company from issuing previously authorized and unissued Common Shares for any purpose or purposes approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to any applicable law and any rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are then listed.
Section 8.      Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates. All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.
12
Section 9.      Reservation and Availability of Common Shares.
(a)    The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares or any authorized and issued Common Shares held in its treasury, the number of Common Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights in accordance with Section 7.
(b)    So long as the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be listed on any national securities exchange, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all Common Shares reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
(c)    The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Common Shares delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such Common Shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares (except as otherwise provided by any corporation law applicable to the Company).
(d)    The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any Common Shares upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates for the Common Shares in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver any certificates for Common Shares upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
Section 10.    Common Shares Record Date. Each person in whose name any certificate for Common Shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Common Shares transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Common Shares transfer books of the Company are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other
13
distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.
Section 11.    Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number of Shares or Number of Rights. The Purchase Price, the number of Common Shares covered by each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
(a)    (i)  In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of Common Shares, or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Common Shares transfer books of the Company were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
(ii)    Subject to Section 24 of this Agreement, in the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to two times the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of Common Shares of the Company as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying two times the then current Purchase Price by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (y) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Company's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of the occurrence of such event (such number of shares, the "Adjustment Shares"). In the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person and the Rights shall then be outstanding, the Company shall not, except as permitted by Section 24 or Section 27, take any action which would eliminate or diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
14
From and after such time as a Person becomes an Acquiring Person (a "Section 11(a)(ii) Event"), any Rights that are or were acquired or beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person (or any Associate or Affiliate of such Acquiring Person) shall be void and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. No Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 that represents Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof; no Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate; and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be cancelled. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this paragraph are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.
(iii)   In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares of the Company issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and not reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon exercise of the Rights) to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Company shall: (A) determine the excess of (1) the value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Right (the "Current Value") over (2) the Purchase Price (such excess, the "Spread"), and (B) with respect to each Right, make adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares, upon payment of the applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in the Purchase Price, (3) equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares, or units of shares, of preferred stock which the Board of Directors of the Company has deemed to have the same value as Common Shares (such shares of preferred stock, hereinafter referred to as "common stock equivalents")), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having an aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company based upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, however, if the Company shall not have made adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (the "Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, Common Shares (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional Common Shares might be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be
15
extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek shareholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such period, as it may be extended, the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to the last paragraph of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period to seek any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the Common Shares shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Common Shares on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date and the value of any "common stock equivalent" shall be deemed to have the same value as the Common Shares on such date.
(b)    In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or securities convertible into Common Shares at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Common Shares) less than the then current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Common Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Common Shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market price and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Common Shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
16
(c)    In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Common Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Common Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Common Share and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Common Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(d)    For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Common Shares or any other security (a Common Share or other security, a "Security" for the purpose of this Section 11(d)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each Trading Day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System ("Nasdaq") or such other system then in use, or, if on
17
any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day. If the Security is not publicly held or so listed or traded, then "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
(e)    No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the date of the expiration of the right to exercise any Rights.
(f)     If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than Common Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Shares contained in Section 11(a) through (c), inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10 and 13 with respect to the Common Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
(g)    All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of Common Shares purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
(h)    Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of Common Shares (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of shares covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
18
(i)     The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of Common Shares for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j)     Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of Common Shares which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
(k)    Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable (except as otherwise provided by any corporation law applicable to the Company) Common Shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(l)     In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the Common Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Common Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment;
19
provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
(m)   Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Common Shares, issuance wholly for cash of any Common Shares at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Common Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares, dividends on Common Shares payable in Common Shares or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Common Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(n)    The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Shares Acquisition Date, (i) consolidate with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof), (ii) merge with or into any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof), (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or (iv) consummate a share exchange with any other Person, if at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale or share exchange (A) there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (B) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale or share exchange the stockholders of the Person who constitute, or would constitute, the issuer of Common Shares for purposes of Section 13 hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates or (C) the form or nature of organization of the Principal Party would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights.
Section 12.    Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of Shares. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 or 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof.
20
Section 13.    Consolidation, Merger, Share Exchange or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power. In the event, directly or indirectly, at any time after a person has become an Acquiring Person, (a) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person, (b) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger, or any Person or Persons shall consummate a share exchange with the Company, and, in connection with such merger or share exchange, all or part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person (or the Company) or cash or any other property, or (c) the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person other than the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that (i) each holder of a Right (except as otherwise provided herein) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to two times the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of Common Shares of such other Person (including the Company as successor thereto or as the surviving corporation) as shall equal the result obtained by (A) multiplying two times the then current Purchase Price by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Common Shares of such other Person (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale or transfer; (ii) the issuer of such Common Shares shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such issuer; and (iv) such issuer shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights. The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale or transfer unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement so providing. The Company shall not enter into any transaction of the kind referred to in this Section 13 if at the time of such transaction there are any rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which, as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or sales or other transfers.
21
Section 14.    Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.
(a)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.
(b)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of fractional Common Shares, the Company may, at its sole option, pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Common Share. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
(c)    The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).
Section 15.    Rights of Action. All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to, this Agreement.
22
Section 16.    Agreement of Right Holders. Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:
(a)    prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares;
(b)    after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal office of the Rights Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and
(c)    the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 17.    Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Shareholder. No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Common Shares or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section 18.    Concerning the Rights Agent.
(a)    The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability in the premises.
(b)    The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of this Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate for the Common Shares or for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be
23
signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper person or persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 20 hereof.
Section 19.    Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent.
(a)    Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided, that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
(b)    In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
Section 20.    Duties of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
(a)    The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
(b)    Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one
24
of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(c)    The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
(d)    The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e)    The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Section 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after actual notice that such change or adjustment is required); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Common Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any Common Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(f)     The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
(g)    The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions.
(h)    The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in, or act as the transfer agent for, any of the Rights, Common Shares or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in
25
any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i)     The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
Section 21.    Change of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of the date of such notice as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of the date of such notice as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any state of the United States so long as such corporation is authorized to do business in the State of New York or the State of Wisconsin, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million, or (b) an Affiliate of a corporation described in clause (a) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Shares, and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of such effective date as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall
26
not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 22.    Issuance of New Right Certificates. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 23.    Redemption.
(a)    The Rights may be redeemed by action of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 or by shareholder action pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this Section 23 and shall not be redeemed in any other manner.
(b)    The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.01 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
(c)    If the Company, not earlier than 60 Business Days nor later than 80 Business Days following the commencement of a Qualified Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act, which has not been terminated prior thereto and which continues to be a Qualified Offer, receives a written notice complying with the terms of this Section 23(c) (the "Special Meeting Notice") that is properly executed by the holders of record (or their duly authorized proxy) of at least ten percent (10%) of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) directing the Board of Directors of the Company to submit to a vote of shareholders at a special meeting of the shareholders of the Company (a "Special Meeting") a resolution authorizing the redemption of all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price (the "Redemption Resolution"), then the Board of Directors of the Company shall take such actions as are necessary or desirable to cause the Redemption Resolution to be so submitted to a vote of shareholders by including a proposal relating to adoption of the Redemption Resolution in the proxy materials of the Company for the Special Meeting; provided, however, that in any 12-month period the Company shall not be required to submit more than one Redemption Resolution to a vote of shareholders with respect to Qualified Offers from any given potential Acquiring Person (including any Affiliates or Associates). For purposes of a Special Meeting Notice, the record date for determining eligible holders of record shall be the 60th Business Day following the commencement of a Qualified Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act. Any Special Meeting Notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the
27
principal executive offices of the Company and must set forth as to the shareholders of record executing the request (i) the name and address of such shareholders, as they appear on the Company's books and records, (ii) the class and number of Common Shares of the Company that are owned of record by each of such shareholders, and (iii) in the case of Common Shares owned beneficially by another Person, an executed certification by the holder of record that such holder has executed such Special Meeting Notice only after obtaining instructions to do so from such beneficial owner. The Board of Directors shall set a date for determining the shareholders of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting in accordance with the Company's Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and applicable law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company may take a position in favor of or opposed to the adoption of the Redemption Resolution, or no position with respect to the Redemption Resolution, as it determines to be appropriate in the exercise of its duties. At the offeror's request, the Company shall include in any proxy soliciting material prepared by it in connection with the Special Meeting proxy soliciting material submitted by the offeror; provided, however, that the offeror, by written agreement with the Company contained in or delivered with such request, shall have indemnified the Company against any and all liabilities resulting from any statements found to be defamatory, misstatements, misleading statements or omissions contained in or omitted from the offeror's proxy soliciting materials and have agreed to pay the Company's incremental costs incurred as a result of including such material in the Company's proxy soliciting material. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best interests of shareholders to seek an alternative transaction so as to obtain greater value for shareholders than that provided by any Qualified Offer, the Company shall be entitled to include information relating to such alternative transaction in the proxy soliciting material prepared by it in connection with the Special Meeting. If no Person has become an Acquiring Person prior to the redemption date referred to in this Section 23(c), and the Qualified Offer continues to be a Qualified Offer and either (A) the Special Meeting is not held on or prior to the 90th Business Day following receipt of the Special Meeting Notice, or (B) at the Special Meeting, the holders of at least a majority of the Common Shares outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date for the Special Meeting, not giving effect to any affirmative votes cast by the offeror or any of its Affiliates or Associates, shall vote in favor of the Redemption Resolution (and the results of the vote are certified as official by the appointed inspectors of election for the Special Meeting), then all of the Rights shall be deemed redeemed by such failure to hold the Special Meeting or as a result of such shareholder action, as the case may be, at the Redemption Price, or the Board of Directors shall take such other action as would prevent the existence of the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer, effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Qualified Offer, if, and only if, the Qualified Offer is consummated within 60 days after either (x) the close of business on the 90th Business Day following receipt of the Special Meeting Notice if a Special Meeting is not held on or prior to such date or (y) the date on which the results of the vote on the Redemption Resolution at the Special Meeting are certified as official by the appointed inspectors of election for the Special Meeting, as the case may be. Nothing in this subparagraph (c) shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting the Company or any offeror from proposing or engaging in any
28
acquisition, disposition or other transfer of any securities of the Company, any merger or consolidation involving the Company, any sale or other transfer of assets of the Company, any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, or any other business combination or other transaction, or any other action by the Company or such offeror; provided, however, that the holders of Rights shall have the rights set forth in this Rights Agreement with respect to any such acquisition, disposition, transfer, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, business combination, transaction or action.
(d)    Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 or the effectiveness of such redemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 23 (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.
29
Section 24.    Exchange.
(a)    The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares of the Company at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
(b)    Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
(c)    In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights.
(d)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company may, at its sole option, pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), the current market value of a whole Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24.
30
Section 25.    Notice of Certain Events.
(a)    In case the Company shall propose, after the Distribution Date, (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Common Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Common Shares (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Common Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Common Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Common Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Common Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with, to effect any share exchange with or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person, (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Common Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.
(b)    In case a Section 11(a)(ii) Event shall occur, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.

(c)    Without limiting the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to reject any Qualified Offer or any other tender offer or exchange offer or other acquisition proposal, or to recommend that holders of Common Shares reject any Qualified Offer or any other tender offer or exchange offer or other acquisition proposal, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, defense or settlement of any litigation and the submission of additional or alternative offers or other proposals) with respect to any Qualified Offer or any other tender offer or exchange offer or other acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors believes is necessary or appropriate in the exercise of its fiduciary duties.

Exhibit B
SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE COMMON SHARES
On August 6, 1996, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend is payable on August 19, 1996 (the "Record Date") to the shareholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one-half of one Common Share of the Company at a price (the "Purchase Price") of $80 per full share (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split of the Common Shares effected as a 100% stock dividend effective October 29, 2004), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and National City Bank, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent") dated as of August 7, 1996, as amended through August 9, 2006 and as may thereafter be amended. Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 days following public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (other than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an employee benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary) (an "Acquiring Person") have acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group (other than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an employee benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary) of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Share certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any other person or group of affiliated or associated persons who, at the close of business on August 7, 1996, was the beneficial owner of at least 5,785,400 Common Shares (which number of shares constituted 20% of the number of Common Shares outstanding on such date, without giving effect to the two-for-one stock split of the Common Shares effective October 29, 2004) will not be deemed an "Acquiring Person" unless such person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquires beneficial ownership of additional Common Shares at any time that such person or group of affiliated or associated persons is or thereby becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), (i) the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares; (ii) new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference; and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
4
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on October 18, 2009 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company (including by shareholder action in connection with a "Qualified Offer" as defined in the Agreement), in each case, as described below.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Common Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Common Shares with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Common Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
In the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current Purchase Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the then current Purchase Price. In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise at the then current Purchase Price that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
At any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right (subject to adjustment).
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. The Company is not required to issue any fractional Common Shares and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash may be made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
At any time prior to the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. In addition, if the Company receives a Qualified Offer (as defined in the Agreement), then the Rights may be redeemed by way of shareholder action taken at a special meeting of
5
shareholders called by the Board upon the written notice of the holders of at least 10% of Common Shares then outstanding (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) for the purpose of voting on a resolution accepting the Qualified Offer and authorizing the redemption of the Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement. The written notice must be received by the Company not earlier than 60 nor later than 80 business days following the commencement of a Qualified Offer that has not been terminated prior thereto and that continues to be a Qualified Offer. The special meeting must be held on or prior to the 90th business day following Company's receipt of such notice. Such an action by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all Common Shares entitled to vote on such issue (excluding Common Shares held by the offeror and its Affiliates or Associates). If either (A) the special meeting is not held on or prior to the 90th business day following receipt of the special meeting notice, or (B) at the special meeting, the requisite holders of Common Shares vote in favor of the redemption resolution, then all of the Rights will be deemed redeemed by such failure to hold the special meeting or as a result of such shareholder action, as the case may be, at the Redemption Price, or the Board of Directors shall take such other action as would prevent the existence of the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer, effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Qualified Offer if, and only if, the Qualified Offer is consummated within 60 days after either (x) the close of business on the 90th business day following receipt of the special meeting notice if a special meeting is not held on or prior to such date or (y) the date on which the results of the vote on the redemption resolution at the special meeting are certified as official, as the case may be. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
"Qualified Offer" means an offer that has each of the following characteristics:
a fully financed all-cash tender offer or an exchange offer offering at least 70 percent cash and Common Shares of the offeror, in each such case for any and all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company;
                   
an offer that has commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act;
                   
an offer whose per-share offer price (A) is greater than the highest reported market price for the Common Shares of the Company during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced and (B) represents a reasonable premium above the average of the closing prices for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced;
                   
an offer that (A) is accompanied by a written opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is addressed to the Company and the holders of Common Shares of the Company other than such Person and states that the price to be paid to such holders pursuant to the offer is fair from a financial point of view to such holders and includes any written presentation of such firm showing the analysis and range of values underlying such conclusions, which written opinion and any such presentation are updated and provided to the Company prior to the date such offer is consummated, and (B) within 20 business days after the commencement date of the offer (or within 10 business days after any increase in the offer consideration), does not result in a nationally
                   
6
recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company rendering an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares is either unfair or inadequate;
if the offer includes Common Shares of the offeror, an offer pursuant to which (A) the offeror shall permit a nationally recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company and legal counsel designated by the Company to have access to such offeror's books, records, management, accountants and other appropriate outside advisers for the purposes of permitting such investment banking firm and such legal counsel to conduct a due diligence review of the offeror in order to permit such investment banking firm to be able to render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to whether the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company is fair or adequate, and (B) within 10 business days after such investment banking firm shall have notified the Company and the offeror that it had completed the due diligence review to its satisfaction (or following completion of such due diligence review within 10 business days after any increase in the consideration being offered), such investment banking firm does not render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company is either unfair or inadequate and such investment banking firm does not after the expiration of such 10 business day period render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company has become either unfair or inadequate based on a subsequent disclosure or discovery of a development or developments that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on the value of the Common Shares of the offeror;
                   
an offer that is subject only to the minimum tender condition described below and other usual and customary terms and conditions, which conditions shall not include any financing, funding or similar condition or any requirements with respect to the offeror or its agents being permitted any due diligence with respect to the books, records, management, accountants and other outside advisers of the Company;
                   
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that the offer will remain open for at least 60 business days and, if a special meeting is duly requested under the redemption provisions, for, at least 10 business days after the date of the special meeting or, if no special meeting is held within 90 business days following receipt of the special meeting notice, for at least 10 business days following such 90 business day period;
                   
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror that the offer, it if is otherwise to expire prior thereto, will be extended for at least 20 business days after any increase in the price offered, and after any bona fide alternative offer is commenced;
                   
an offer that is conditioned on a minimum of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares (other than Common Shares held by the offeror) being tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer's expiration date, which condition shall not be waivable;
                   
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror to consummate as promptly as practicable upon successful completion of the offer a second step transaction whereby all Common Shares not tendered into the
                   
7
offer will be acquired at the same amount and form of consideration per share actually paid pursuant to the offer, subject to shareholders' statutory appraisal rights, if any;
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that no amendments will be made to the offer to reduce the offer consideration, change the form of consideration offered, reduce the number of shares being sought, or otherwise change the terms of the offer in a way that is adverse to a tendering shareholder;
                   
if the offer includes Common Shares of the offeror, (A) the offeror is a publicly owned United States corporation, and its Common Shares are freely tradable and are listed or admitted to trading on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (B) no shareholder approval of the offeror is required to issue such Common Shares, or, if required, such approval has already been obtained, (C) no Person beneficially owns more than 20% of the voting stock of the offeror at the time of commencement of the offer or at any time during the term of the offer, and (D) no other class of voting stock of the offeror is outstanding, and the offeror meets the registrant eligibility requirements for use of Form S-3 for registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including, without limitation, the filing of all required Exchange Act reports in a timely manner during the 12 calendar months prior to the date of commencement of the offer;
                   
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that the offeror will pay (or share with any other offeror) at least one-half of the Company's costs of a special meeting requested with respect to such offer; and
                   
an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that if the offer is not consummated, the offeror will not make any offer for or purchase any equity securities of the Company for a period of one year after the commencement of the original offer if such original offer does not result in the tender of at least 85% of the outstanding Common Shares, not owned by the offeror.
                   
The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights except that from and after such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
A copy of the Rights Agreement, as amended through August 9, 2006, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to the Company's Amended Registration Statement on Form 8-A/A filed on August 15, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced first quarter consolidated net sales of $338.2 million and a net loss of $18.0 million or $.36 per diluted share.  Consolidated net sales decreased $173.5 million or 34% from the prior year while net income decreased $22.8 million from the same period a year ago.
The $173.5 million consolidated net sales decrease was the result of reductions in unit volume experienced in both segments.  One major cause of the reduction in volume was the lack of landed-hurricane activity this year as opposed to last year's significant events.  This impacted the sales of both generator product and the engines used to power them.  The other major contributors to the lower volume between years were the reduced OEM demand for engines for lawn and garden equipment due to this year's soft retail season and the reduction of lawn equipment shipments to retailers in the 2006 lawn and garden season.
The $22.8 million reduction in net income is primarily the result of lost gross profits associated with the reduced unit volumes discussed above.
Engines:
Fiscal 2007 first quarter net sales were $189.6 million, a $95.8 million or 34% reduction from the prior year.  This decrease reflects 37% lower engine unit shipments compared to the same period a year ago.  In fiscal 2006, first quarter shipments benefited from a normal U.S. retail lawn and garden season and increased OEM demand from Europe.  A soft retail sales environment negatively impacted the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  There was improved late summer demand that moved retail inventories, but did not result in a meaningful replenishment of engines.  In addition, the lack of weather related events that drive generator sales caused replenishment demand for engines to be less than a year ago.
There was a $24.1 million loss from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  This loss was $32.9 million less than the operating income of $8.8 million reported for the same period a year ago.  The decrease in operating income between years was primarily the result of lower engine shipments.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2007 first quarter net sales were $186.9 million, a $113.7 million or 38% reduction from the same period a year ago.  The decrease in net sales results primarily from a decrease in unit shipments in several product categories that experienced softer retail demand during the period.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2006 generator sales were positively impacted by two hurricanes that made land fall.  The lack of landed-hurricanes in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 caused unit shipments to be down approximately 50% between years.  Our sales of lawn and garden equipment are down approximately $53.5 million due to lower shipments of Murray branded products.  Pressure washer sales are lower than a year ago as a result of approximately 45% lower unit shipments.  Similar to lawn and garden product, sales of pressure washers at retail were soft this season.
The first quarter of fiscal 2007 had income from operations of $2.8 million.  This represents a $2.6 million increase over income from operations generated in the same period a year ago.  An improvement of $11.6 million in operating income between years resulted from the absence of the loss associated with the closing down of Murray, Inc. operations in the first quarter a year ago.  The partial offset to this improvement was caused primarily by increased manufacturing costs, and lower sales and production volumes associated with generator and pressure washer products.
General:
Interest expense was lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 because a repayment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 lowered outstanding debt.  The effective tax rate was at 34.5% versus the 35.0% used in the first quarter last year.
 
Share Repurchase Program:
The Company has repurchased $48 million of its common stock through open market transactions in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  The Company has authorization to repurchase another $72 million of common stock, with the timing and amount of purchases dependent on the market price of the stock and certain governing loan covenants.
Outlook:
We believe that the placement of a majority of the engine business for the 2007 lawn and garden season can now be identified.  We currently project the market to be flat between years and anticipate that our market share may be down slightly.
Two significant issues at this time are the lack of hurricane related generator sales and a less than anticipated demand for snow thrower product.  Lack of retail demand caused by these two issues has significantly impacted our outlook for fiscal 2007 in both of our segments.  Our projections for the Power Products Segment now assume that there will be no hurricane events in fiscal 2007 and the current inventory of generators at the major retailers may not require substantial replenishment until the next hurricane season.  The fall off in seasonal generator needs, early soft demand for snow product and a lower forecast for pressure washer market growth decreases our sales and production volume forecasts in the Power Products Segment.  We estimate that the Power Products Segment sales will now be $1.05 billion and income from operations in the range of $49 to $55 million.
The Engines Segment sales and production volumes are projected lower for the year based on the assumption of a flat lawn and garden market in the spring of 2007 and the recognition that we are a market leader in providing engines for the domestic portable generator market.  We now project a decline in engine unit shipment volume of approximately 8% from last year that is weighted to larger displacement, generator-related product.  This reduces our current sales forecast for the segment to approximately $1.55 billion.  We are currently lowering our production output to address the reduced demand forecast but the loss of production volume will also increase our operating costs as we get less utilization of our fixed investment at several plants.  The impact of reduced sales and production volumes results in an income from operations projection in the range of $91 to $105 million for the Engines Segment.
Interest expense and other income are forecasted to be $43.0 million and $13.6 million, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range from 33.0% to 35.0%.  The current forecast results in net income for fiscal 2007 in the range of $75 to $85 million or $1.51 to $1.71 per diluted share.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is projected to be in the range of breakeven to a loss of $5.0 million. The second quarter forecasted results are lower than in the same period a year ago because there are significantly lower sales of generators and a corresponding reduction in shipments and production related to engines used on generator applications. In addition, shipments of engines for lawn and garden equipment for the spring of 2007 are lower between years because equipment manufacturers are scheduling more of their deliveries for the second half of the fiscal year, closer to the season.
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: http://www.briggsandstratton.com/shareholders. Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (800) 804-3550. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week. Dial (888) 266-2081 to access the replay. The pass code will be 972422.

On January 18, 2007, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing fiscal 2007 second quarter results in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Briggs & Stratton today announced second quarter fiscal 2007 consolidated net sales of $423.1 million and a consolidated net loss of $5.9 million or $.12 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2006 had consolidated net sales of $574.3 million and net income of $21.8 million or $.42 per diluted share. The $151.2 million, or 26%, decrease in consolidated net sales was primarily due to two factors. Unit shipments were lower due to reduced generator sales as compared to the prior year when landed hurricanes had contributed to higher demand. Also, we experienced a delay in shipments to lawn and garden engine customers who have chosen to assemble product closer to the selling season. The $27.7 million decrease in consolidated net income reflects the impact of both lower sales and production volumes in both reporting segments, offset by lower expenses related to engineering, selling and administrative activities.
For the first six months of fiscal 2007, the Company had consolidated net sales of $761.3 million and a consolidated net loss of $23.9 million or $.48 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1.086 billion and consolidated net income was $26.5 million or $.51 per diluted share. The decline in the first six month's consolidated net sales of the $324.7 million, or 30%, was primarily attributable to lower shipments resulting from the same factors mentioned above for the second fiscal quarter. The $50.4 million decrease in consolidated net income primarily reflects the significant decline in unit shipments and production volume in both reporting segments, partially offset by planned reductions in engineering, selling and administrative expenses.
Engines:
Fiscal 2007 second quarter net sales were $279.0 million versus $380.8 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of 27%. The decrease resulted from a 30% decrease in engine unit shipments between quarters. Sales for the first half of fiscal 2007 were $468.6 million versus $666.3 million in the prior year, a 30% reduction. The decrease resulted from a 33% decrease in engine unit shipments between years. Engine unit shipment reductions in the quarter were the result of lower demand for generator engines and deferral of demand for engines for lawn and garden equipment. Last year demand for generator engines was strong due to significant landed hurricanes which were absent this year. Manufacturers of lawn equipment have chosen to assemble closer to the spring selling season and consequently our expected shipments have shifted into the last half of our fiscal year.
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $6.0 million, down $29.7 million from the same period a year ago. The major reasons for the decrease in income from operations were the loss of margins due to lower sales ($33 million) and the reduction in margins resulting from a 20% decrease in production activity ($8 million). Margin declines were offset by a reduction in operating expenses ($11 million), which were primarily reductions in professional services.
The loss from operations for the first half of fiscal 2007 was $18.1 million, a decline in income from operations of $62.6 million from the same period a year ago. The major reasons for the decrease in income from operations were the loss of margins due to lower sales ($63 million) and the reduction in margins resulting from a 16% decrease in production activity ($12 million). Margin declines were offset by reductions in operating expenses ($13 million), related to professional services and employee related costs.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2007 second quarter net sales were $170.4 million, an $86.3 million decrease from the same period a year ago. Approximately 60% of the decrease in net sales was related to a 60% decline in portable generator sales caused by the lack of landed hurricanes in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in shipments of consumer lawn and garden equipment. Fiscal 2006 included sales to retailers from the bankrupt Murray operation that we acquired in February 2005. The wind-down of this operation was completed in fiscal 2006 and accordingly, fiscal 2007 sales for Murray products have dropped significantly.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2007 were $357.3 million, a $200.0 million decrease over the same period a year ago. Similar to the second fiscal quarter, approximately half of the decrease in net sales was related to a 53% decline in portable generator sales caused by the lack of landed hurricanes and the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in shipments of consumer lawn and garden equipment for the same reasons mentioned for the quarter.
The loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $4.0 million, a decline in income from operations of $9.5 million from the same period a year ago. The decrease in income from operations was the result of significantly lower portable generator sales and production activity and increased costs for raw materials and components for product that was produced.
The loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2007 was $1.2 million, a decline in income from operations of $6.9 million from the same period a year ago. The majority of the decrease in income from operations was the result of the same factors mentioned for the quarter. The margin decline from those factors was partially offset by reduced expenses that totaled $10.7 million in the prior year related to the wind down of Murray operations.
General:
Interest expense was higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 due to increases in variable interest rates between years. The second quarter and year to date fiscal 2007 effective tax rates are at 30% and 33%, respectively, versus the 35% used in both comparable periods last year.
Other Matters:
We continue to evaluate and make changes to our manufacturing footprint. Location, capacity, flexibility, product demand and costs are all factors that are considered to optimize our global manufacturing operations. As a result of this effort:
 
 
 
Outlook:
Our forecast continues to assume that the lawn and garden market will be flat in the spring of 2007. However, current information about our placement in the European market for the upcoming lawn and garden season, what appears to be a soft snow thrower sales season due to limited snow fall and further reductions in our projections of the potential generator market make us believe we may ship 2% to 3% fewer engines than we had anticipated. This reduces our current sales forecast for the Engines Segment to approximately $1.51 billion. The reduced sales projection also causes us to lower our production output to address the reduced demand forecast. This loss of production volume will increase our operating costs and reduce our efficiency as we experience lower utilization of our fixed costs at several plants. The impact of reduced sales and production volumes results in an income from operations projection in the range of $76 to $85 million for the Engines Segment for fiscal 2007.
Our fiscal 2007 projections for the Power Products Segment now reflect a further fall-off in spring generator needs, a higher mix of lower margined pressure washer product and softer demand for snow product due to what we believe will be a poor snow season. We now estimate that the Power Products Segment sales will be $1.03 billion and income from operations in the range of $46 to $51 million.
We forecast interest expense and other income for fiscal 2007 to be $43.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range from 32% to 34%. The current forecast results in consolidated net income for fiscal 2007 in the range of $62 to $72 million or $1.24 to $1.44 per diluted share.
Net income for the second half of fiscal 2007 is projected to be in the range of $86 to $96 million or $1.72 to $1.92 per diluted share. We are providing projections for the second half of the fiscal year because we feel lawn and garden equipment manufacturers will schedule more of their production closer to the selling season which could cause some shifting of engine shipments between our fiscal third and fourth quarters.
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (EST) on January 18, 2007 to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on its corporate website:

On April 19, 2007, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing fiscal 2007 third quarter results in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2007 third quarter consolidated net sales of $717.1 million and consolidated net income of $7.8 million or $.15 per diluted share, that included a $35.2 million pretax ($21.4 million after tax or $.42 per diluted share) write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States. The third quarter of fiscal 2006 had consolidated net sales of $800.2 million and consolidated net income of $60.0 million or $1.16 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales decreased $83.1 million or 10%. Approximately 47% of the reduction is due to softer sales in the Power Products Segment, primarily the result of lower sales volumes of lawn and garden equipment and portable generators. The remainder of the consolidated net sales decrease is due primarily to lower unit shipments of engines. Third quarter consolidated net income decreased $52.2 million between years. In addition to the write-down of assets, net income decreased $30.7 million due to lower sales and production volumes in the Engines Segment and an unfavorable mix to smaller displacement, lower priced engines. Lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased net income $12.5 million between years, however increased expenses in manufacturing during the quarter essentially offset the benefit.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, the Company had consolidated net sales of $1.478 billion and a consolidated net loss of $16.2 million or $.32 per diluted share, that included a $35.2 million pretax ($21.4 million after tax or $.43 per diluted share) write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1.886 billion, and consolidated net income was $86.6 million or $1.67 per diluted share. The $407.8 million or 22% decrease in consolidated net sales was the result of the same factors described above, including a significant decline in engine sales volume in the nine month period related to reduced shipments of engines for portable generators. The nine-month consolidated net income was lower by $102.7 million. In addition to the write-down of assets, net income decreased $74.6 million due to lower sales and production volumes in the Engines Segment. Lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased net income $24.1 million between years, however increased expenses in manufacturing and the impact of lower sales and production volumes in the Power Products Segment essentially offset the benefit.
Engines:
Fiscal third quarter net sales were $516.1 million versus $597.6 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $81.5 million or 14%. The decrease in net sales was the result of a 14% engine unit shipment decline from the same period a year ago. Approximately 60% of the lower unit volume occurred in the United States, with the majority of the decline attributable to lower demand for engines for portable generators. Last year portable generator manufacturers were building inventories in advance of the anticipated hurricane season whereas portable generator inventories are adequate this year. Lower international unit shipments account for the remainder of the decrease and primarily reflect the impact of lower market share in Europe.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 were $984.7 million versus $1.264 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $279.3 million or 22%. The decrease in net sales was basically the result of a 23% engine unit shipment decline from the same period a year ago. Approximately 85% of the lower unit volume occurred in the United States. Lower unit shipments related to portable generators accounts for 40% of the domestic decline. The remainder of the decline resulted from a deferral of production by lawn and garden equipment manufacturers to later in the season and a minor market share decline between years. The reason for the decrease in international volume primarily reflects the impact of lower market share in Europe.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $12.9 million, down $75.9 million from $88.8 million during the same period in the prior year. Approximately $33.9 million of this decline is attributable to expense incurred with the write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States. The balance of this reduction is primarily the result of lower sales and production volumes that impacted operating income by approximately $35.8 million. Lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses of $15.8 million, basically due to planned reductions in these costs, and lower legal and professional fees between years were offset by increases in raw materials and selected manufacturing expenses.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 was a loss of $5.2 million, down $138.5 million from $133.3 million during the same period a year ago. Approximately $33.9 million of this decline is attributable to expense incurred with the write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the
United States. The balance of this reduction resulted from lower sales and production volumes that impacted operating income by approximately $111.8 million. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were lower by $28.7 million for reasons described above and their decrease more than offset increased manufacturing costs, primarily related to raw materials and purchased components.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2007 third quarter net sales were $248.8 million versus $287.8 million from the same period a year ago, a decrease of $39.0 million. The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the reduction of shipments of lawn and garden equipment. The decrease in premium lawn and garden equipment shipments was the result of inventory liquidation at the dealers and a regionally slow start to their selling season. Shipments of lawn and garden product to other major retailers were down due to less product placement than a year ago. Lower portable generator shipments, the result of high retail inventories, accounted for the remainder of the net sales decrease.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 were $606.1 million versus $845.0 million in the prior year, a $238.9 million decrease. Approximately 50% of the decrease in net sales was the result of the reduction of shipments of portable generators due to no landed hurricanes in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The remainder of the net sales decrease was primarily the result of lower shipments of lawn and garden product to major retailers due to less product placement than a year ago.
Income from operations was $5.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, down $8.6 million between years. The operating income reduction was the result of lower sales volumes, primarily on lawn and garden equipment, and lower production volumes for both lawn and garden equipment and portable generators resulting from soft demand and our inventory control initiatives.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 was $4.7 million, a decrease of $15.5 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. The impact of lower sales and production volumes across all segment product lines reduced operating income by approximately $30.9 million. The volume declines were offset by a $12.8 million improvement in operating income due to the lack of losses associated with the wind-down of Murray operations experienced in fiscal 2006.
General:
Other income was greater in the fiscal 2007 third quarter and less in the first nine months of fiscal 2007 due to the timing of dividend receipts from certain investments. Interest expense is greater in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007 due to higher borrowings for working capital and higher rates. The effective tax rate is 40.4% for the third quarter and 29.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 versus 32.4% and 33.2% for the same periods last year, respectively.
Other Matters:
As disclosed in January of 2007, we continue to evaluate and make changes to our manufacturing footprint. Location, capacity, flexibility, product demand and costs are all factors that are considered to optimize our global manufacturing operations.
As a result of this effort, we decided in the third quarter to discontinue our operations in Rolla, Missouri and have recognized an impairment in the value of the fixed assets that we will not be able to use in our other manufacturing locations. Engine manufacturing performed in Rolla today will move to China and other domestic locations.
In addition, we continue to evaluate the future direction of our facilities that produce lawn and garden equipment. The potential asset write-down associated with a decision to close a facility would be in the range of $8 to $10 million. We believe that we will be in a position to make a decision by the end of the current fiscal year.
Outlook:
Our forecast continues to assume that the lawn and garden market will be flat in 2007. However, we are lowering our estimate of engine shipments by 2% to reflect lower potential generator engine shipments, lower shipments to Europe due to loss of placement and a concern that deferral of engine orders by manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment into our fourth quarter may limit their ability to respond to the fourth quarter retail demand. This reduces our current fiscal 2007 sales forecast for the Engines Segment to approximately $1.46 billion. The reduced sales projection also causes us to lower our production output to address the reduced demand forecast and our desire to lower inventories. This loss of production volume will increase our operating costs and reduce our efficiency as we experience lower utilization of our fixed costs at several plants. Our income from operations projection for the Engines Segment for fiscal 2007 is now in the range of $24 to $28 million, including the $33.9 million impact of the asset write-downs recorded in the third quarter.
Our fiscal 2007 projections for the Power Products Segment reflect a further fall-off in spring generator needs and a higher mix of lower margined pressure washer product. We now estimate that the Power Products Segment sales will be $970 million and income from operations in the range of $30 to $36 million. This estimate does not include the potential asset write-down discussed above.
We forecast interest expense and other income for fiscal 2007 to be $43.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range from 17% to 23%. Tax rates in fiscal 2007 were impacted by the availability of tax credits relative to lower income levels.
These factors result in a projection for consolidated net income for the full fiscal year in the range of $19 to $27 million, or $.38 to $.54 per diluted share.

Proxies
(a) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the shareholder's signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(b) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the person who will be appointed as proxy.

Any person charged with determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is made.
An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable
 
and the appointment is coupled with an interest. The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself constitute a revocation. The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity and sufficiency of proxy appointments.
2.10 . Each outstanding share shall be entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to a vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, except to the extent that the voting rights of the shares are enlarged, limited or denied by the Articles of Incorporation or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.

At a minimum, a share certificate shall state on its face the name of the corporation and that it is organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin, the name of the person to whom issued, and the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, that the certificate represents. If the corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or different series within a class, the front or back of the certificate must contain either (i) a summary of the designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class, and the variations in the rights, preferences and limitations determined for each series and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine variations for future series, or (ii) a conspicuous statement that the corporation will furnish the shareholder the information described in clause (i) on request, in writing and without charge.

Prior to due presentment of a certificate for shares for registration of transfer, and unless the corporation has established a procedure by which a beneficial owner of shares held by a nominee is to be recognized by the corporation as the shareholder, the corporation may treat the registered owner of such shares as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to have and exercise all the rights and power of an owner.

Restrictions on Transfer
5.05 .

Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates
5.06 . The shares of the corporation may be issued for such consideration as shall be fixed from time to time and determined to be adequate by the Board of Directors, provided that any shares having a par value shall not be issued for a consideration less than the par value thereof. The consideration may consist of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation. When the corporation receives the consideration for which the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of shares, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable by the corporation.

Director Waiver by Attendance
7.01 . Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, action required or permitted by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken at a Board of Directors meeting or committee meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board or committee. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each director and retained by the corporation. Action taken hereunder is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.

Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless, within seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c), Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the corporation pursuant to Section 7.02; provided, however, that if the corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report that is pending on such 70
th
day pursuant to Section 7.02(e), then such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the corporation pursuant to this Section 7.02 at such time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to Section 7.02(f) or Section 7.02(g). The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof.
(b) Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i) such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report pursuant to Section 7.02(f) or Section 7.02(g) or (ii) seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c) by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D) the inspectors of elections engaged by the corporation pursuant to Section 7.02(c).
(c) Within three (3) Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c), the corporation shall (i) engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as agent of the corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations thereof to such inspectors pursuant to Section 7.02(d). Except as provided in Section 2.05(c)(ii), the cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the corporation.
(d) The corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two (2) Business Days after receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive
 
Consents and/or revocations thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a "Consent Report") to the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating: (i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents; (vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in such report (the "Report Date").
(e) As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the corporation and any parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall state that the corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent Report (the "Preliminary Consent Report"); provided, however, that neither the corporation nor the Consent Soliciting Shareholders may request a Preliminary Consent Report after the 70
th
day after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c). Unless the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the Preliminary Consent Report.

If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and the
 
requisite number or shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.02(e).

A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, if either (i) the date on which the challenge session is completed (the "Completion Date") is more than seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c) or (ii) the Completion Date is not more than seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c), Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not more than seventy (70) days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.02(e).

A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.
(i) As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report and delivery of Consents to the corporation, all Consent Soliciting Shareholders notify the
 
corporation and the inspectors in writing that such Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent Report or deliver such Consents to the corporation.

Procedural Requirements
(a) In cases not included under Section 8.02, a Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under Section 8.01 shall make a written request therefor to the Corporation.

(b) No indemnification shall be required to be paid by the Corporation pursuant to Section 8.01 if, within such sixty-day period, (i) a Disinterested Quorum, by a majority vote thereof, determines that the Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in misconduct constituting a Breach of Duty or (ii) a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained.
(c) In either case of nonpayment pursuant to Section 8.03(b), the Board shall immediately authorize by resolution that an Authority, as provided in Section 8.05, determine whether the Director's or Officer's conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether indemnification should be denied hereunder.
(d)(i) If the Board does not authorize an Authority to determine the Director's or Officer's right to indemnification hereunder within such sixty-day period and/or (ii) if indemnification of the requested amount of Liabilities is paid by the Corporation, then it shall be conclusively presumed for all purposes that a Disinterested Quorum has affirmatively determined that the Director or Officer did not engage in misconduct constituting a Breach of Duty and, in the case of clause (i) above (but not clause (ii)), indemnification by the Corporation of the requested amount of Liabilities shall be paid to the Director or Officer immediately.
8.04 .

Nonduplication
 
8.05 .
Determination of Right to Indemnification
(a) Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, if the Board authorizes an Authority to determine a Director's or Officer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03, then the Director or Officer requesting indemnification shall have the absolute discretionary authority to select one of the following as such Authority:
(i) By a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum. If a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, by majority vote of the Board.
(ii) By independent legal counsel mutually selected by such Director or Officer and by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum or, if a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote of the Board.
(iii) By a panel of three (3) arbitrators selected from the panels of arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association in Wisconsin consisting of one arbitrator selected by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum or, if a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote of the Board, one arbitrator selected by the Director or Officer seeking indemnification and one arbitrator selected by the two (2) arbitrators previously selected.
(iv) By an affirmative vote of shares represented at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum of the voting group entitled to vote thereon is present. Shares owned by, or voted under the control of, persons who are at the time parties to the same or related Proceedings, whether as plaintiffs or defendants or in any other capacity, may not be voted in making the determination.
(v) By a court under Section 8.08.
(vi) By any other method provided for in any additional right to indemnification permitted under Section 8.07.
(b) In any such determination by the selected Authority there shall exist a rebuttable presumption that the Director's or Officer's conduct did not constitute a Breach of Duty and that indemnification against the requested amount of Liabilities is required. The burden of rebutting such a presumption by clear and convincing evidence shall be on the Corporation or such other party asserting that such indemnification should not be allowed.
(c) The Authority shall make its determination as to a Director's or Officer's indemnification under Section 8.01 within sixty days of being selected and shall submit a written opinion of its conclusion simultaneously to both the Corporation and the Director or Officer.

other claims, issues or matters, involved in the subject Proceeding, then the Corporation shall be required to pay (as set forth above) only the amount of such requested Liabilities as the Authority shall deem appropriate in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding. The Corporation shall also pay all Expenses incurred in the determination process under (a) by either the Corporation or the Director or Officer, including, without limitation, all Expenses of the selected Authority.
(e) A determination by the Authority that indemnification is required hereunder shall be binding upon the Corporation regardless of any prior determination that the Director or Officer engaged in a Breach of Duty.
8.06 . Within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request by a Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse his or her reasonable Expenses as incurred if the Director or Officer provides the Corporation with all of the following:
Advance of Expenses
(a) A written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has not engaged in misconduct that constitutes a Breach of Duty.
(b) A written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay the allowance to the extent that it is ultimately determined under Section 8.05 that indemnification under Section 8.01 is not required and that indemnification is not ordered by a court under Section 8.08(b)(2). The undertaking under this subsection shall be an unlimited general obligation of the Director or Officer and may be accepted without reference to his or her ability to repay the allowance. The undertaking may be unsecured.
If the Director or Officer must repay any previously advanced Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.05, then such Director or Officer shall not be required to pay interest on such amounts.
8.07 .

(d) A resolution of the Board of Directors.
(e) A resolution adopted by the requisite vote of the Corporation's voting shares.

8.08 .
Court-Ordered Indemnification
(a) Except as provided otherwise by written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, a Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the Proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. Application shall be made for an initial determination by the court under Section 8.05(a)(5) or for review by the court of an adverse determination under Section 8.05(a) (1), (2), (3), (4) or (6). After receipt of an application, the court shall give any notice it considers necessary.
(b) The court shall order indemnification if it determines any of the following:
(i) That the Director or Officer is entitled to indemnification under Sections 8.01 or 8.02.
(ii) That the Director or Officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, regardless of whether indemnification is required under Section 8.02.

8.09 .
Indemnification and Allowance of Expenses of Certain Others
(a) The Corporation shall indemnify an employee of the Corporation who is not a Director or Officer, to the extent that he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of a Proceeding, for all reasonable Expenses incurred in the Proceeding if the employee was a Party because he or she was an employee of the Corporation.

8.10 . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was an employee, agent, Director or Officer of the Corporation against Liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in his or her capacity as an employee, agent, Director or Officer, regardless of whether the Corporation is required or authorized to indemnify or allow Expenses to the individual against the same Liability under Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.06, 8.07 and 8.09.
Insurance
 
8.11 .

(b) If any provision of this Article VIII shall be deemed invalid or inoperative, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions of this Article VIII contravene public policy, then this Article VIII shall be construed so that the remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect, and any such provisions which are invalid or inoperative or which contravene public policy shall be deemed, without further action or deed by or on behalf of the Corporation, to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable; it being understood that it is the Corporation's intention to provide the Directors and Officers with the broadest possible protection against personal liability allowable under the Statute.

On July 12, 2007, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a $500 million amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates that certain credit agreement between the Company and the existing lenders dated as of May 28, 2004 (as previously amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for up to $500 million in revolving loans and swingline loans (collectively, the "Revolver"). Under the Revolver, the Company may borrow up to $25 million in swingline loans. The Company will use proceeds of the Revolver to, among other things, pay off amounts outstanding under the Company's Term Loan Agreement dated as of February 11, 2005 with various financial institutions and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended prior to the date hereof.
The Amended Credit Agreement has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the Revolver will be due and payable on July 12, 2012. Amounts available under the Revolver are reduced by letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement not to exceed $50 million in the aggregate of all undrawn amounts and amounts that have yet to be disbursed under all existing letters of credit.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that the Company considers usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, but does not contain a Minimum Net Worth Covenant. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Revolver.
At any time during the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company may, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are satisfied, elect to increase the maximum amount available under the Revolver from $500 million by up to an amount not to exceed $250 million through, at the Company's election, increases of commitments by existing lenders and/or the addition of new lenders.
Each revolving loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on whether certain criteria are satisfied, or (ii) the higher of (a) the sum of the federal funds rate and 0.5% and (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A.
The Company must also pay a fee, which may range from .10% to .20% on the aggregate unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement, and a fee, which may range from .25% to 1.00% on the undrawn amount of letters of credit.
Bank of America, N.A., and certain of the parties to the Amended Credit Agreement and certain of their respective affiliates have performed in the past, and may perform in the future, banking, investment banking or other advisory services for the Company and its affiliates from time to time for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this and under , each Offshore Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the LIBOR used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Relations Contact:
James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5855
MILWAUKEE, WI August 9, 2007/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced fiscal 2007 fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $678.9 million and consolidated net income of $16.3 million or $.32 per diluted share, that included a $7.9 million pretax ($4.8 million after tax or $0.09 per diluted share) write-down of assets associated with a plan to close its Port Washington, Wisconsin manufacturing facility by October, 2008. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 had consolidated net sales of $656.0 million and consolidated net income of $15.8 million, or $.31 per diluted share. The consolidated net sales increase of $22.9 million or 3.5% was due to a $77.6 million or 20% increase in the Engines Segment's net sales offset by a $56.2 million or 17% decrease in the Power Products Segment's net sales. Fourth quarter consolidated net income, excluding the write-down of assets, improved by over $5 million as compared to the prior year. The improvement is attributed to increased engine unit shipments offset by lower shipments of generator units and reduced fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes.
For fiscal 2007, the Company had consolidated net sales of $2.16 billion and consolidated net income of $0.1 million or $0 per diluted share. For fiscal 2006, consolidated net sales were $2.54 billion, and consolidated net income was $102.3 million or $1.98 per diluted share. The $385.0 million or 15% decrease in consolidated net sales was due to reduced shipments of portable generators, decreases in engine unit shipments and reduced shipments of lawn and garden equipment caused primarily by unfavorable market conditions during the year. Fiscal 2007 consolidated net income decreased $102.2 million from the previous year. The fiscal 2007 net income included $26.2 million, after taxes, related to write-downs of assets associated with the announced rationalization of two manufacturing plants. In addition, net income decreased due to lower sales and production volumes in the Engines Segment and an unfavorable mix to smaller displacement, lower priced engines. Net income also decreased due to lower portable generator sales and production volumes as a result of fewer landed hurricanes in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. These lower sales and production volumes were partially offset by reduced spending for engineering, selling and administrative expenses.
Engines:
Fiscal 2007 fourth quarter net sales were $462.4 million versus $384.8 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $77.6 million or 20%. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of a 27% increase in engine unit shipments compared to the same period a year ago. We believe a portion of this increase was caused by timing of shipments to lawn and garden OEMs moving from our 2007 third fiscal quarter to our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal 2007 third quarter unit shipments had decreased 14% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This shift in the timing of engine shipments was the result of lawn and garden OEMs producing to retail demand and closely monitoring inventory levels in relation to that demand.
Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $1.45 billion versus $1.65 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $201.2 million or 12%. The primary reason for the decrease is due to a 66% reduction of engine shipments for portable generators caused by a lack of events, such as hurricanes, that cause power outages. The remainder of the decrease is due to lower demand for engine powered lawn and garden equipment in the U.S. along with a smaller market share in Europe. Unfavorable weather conditions and various economic factors contributed to difficult market conditions for lawn and garden products. Pricing improvements and the impact of favorable Euro exchange rates in fiscal 2007 were almost entirely offset by an unfavorable mix shift to smaller displacement, lower priced engines.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $20.7 million, up $4.2 million from $16.5 million during the same period in the prior year. The favorable impact from the increase in engine unit shipments was offset by the unfavorable mix shift discussed above, reduced fixed cost absorption of approximately $12.0 million as a result of reducing units produced by 22%, increased raw material costs and increased spending related to our engine plant in Ostrava, Czech Republic which opened in December 2006. In addition, fiscal 2006 included gains of $6.1 million associated with certain asset sales that were not recurring in fiscal 2007. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were lower than the prior year by $11.3 million, primarily due to planned reductions in these costs including reduced salaries and benefits, and lower legal and professional fees between years.
Income from operations for fiscal 2007 was $15.5 million, down $134.3 million from $149.8 million in fiscal 2006. Approximately $33.9 million of the decline is attributable to expense incurred with the write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States. The balance of the reduction resulted primarily from lower sales and production volumes, and increased costs for raw materials. Lower unit sales negatively impacted fiscal 2007 income from operations by approximately $70.0 million. Pricing improvements and the impact of favorable Euro exchange rates in fiscal 2007 were almost entirely offset by an unfavorable mix shift to smaller displacement, lower priced engines. Raw material cost increases primarily related to aluminum, steel, and zinc also negatively impacted operating earnings. Engine production volumes decreased 18.9% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reducing fixed cost absorption by approximately $45.0 million. In addition, fiscal 2006 included gains of approximately $12.2 million associated with certain asset sales that were not recurring in fiscal 2007. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were lower by $40.0 million in fiscal 2007, primarily due to planned reductions in these costs as described above.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2007 fourth quarter net sales were $284.3 million versus $340.5 million from the same period a year ago, a decrease of $56.2 million. Approximately $16.0 million of the decrease was the result of the anticipated reduction of Murray branded lawn and garden product sold to retailers. The remainder of the net sales decrease was due to a 70% reduction of portable generator unit shipments because of lower pre-hurricane season generator sales both at wholesale and retail, given the lack of hurricane activity over the past 12 months. These sales decreases were partially offset by a 94% increase in pressure washer units shipped in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year resulting from strong consumer demand during the spring selling season.
Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $890.4 million versus $1.19 billion in the prior year, a $295.6 million decrease. Approximately $113.0 million of the decrease was the result of the anticipated reduction of Murray branded lawn and garden product sold to retailers. The remainder of the net sales decrease was due to a 58% reduction of portable generator unit shipments because of no landed hurricane activity in fiscal 2007 and lower pre-hurricane season sales. These sales decreases were partially offset by an increase in pressure washer unit shipments compared to the same period in the prior year and the new introduction of air compressor and home standby generator products.
Income from operations was $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, a decrease of $7.8 million from the same period a year ago. Approximately $7.9 million of the decrease is related to the write-down of assets associated with a plan to close the Port Washington manufacturing facility by October 2008. Higher sales and production volumes of pressure washers, along with the fact that fiscal 2006 included expenses associated with the liquidation of assets acquired from Murray, Inc. that were not recurring in fiscal 2007, improved income from operations, but were offset by lower unit sales and production volumes of portable generators. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately $0.6 million from the previous year due to planned reductions.
Income from operations for fiscal 2007 was $6.4 million, a decrease of $23.2 million from the same period a year ago. Approximately $7.9 million of the decrease is related to the write-down of assets associated with a plan to close the Port Washington manufacturing facility by October 2008. Significantly lower unit sales and production volumes of portable generators were primarily responsible for the remainder of the decrease. The fiscal 2006 expenses associated with the liquidation of assets acquired from Murray, Inc. that were not recurring in fiscal 2007, the benefit from higher sales and production volumes of pressure washers and engineering, selling and administrative expenses that decreased approximately $8.1 million from the previous year due to planned reductions partially offset a portion of the generator impact.
General:
Fourth quarter 2007 other income increased $1.2 million over the same period in the prior year, but the full fiscal year decreased $3.7 million from the prior year. The decrease in other income for the full fiscal year is due to the timing of certain dividends received as well as changes in the Company's portion of earnings at its joint venture investments. The effective tax rate is -4.7% for the fourth quarter and 102.0% for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year's fourth quarter and full year rates of 30.6% and 32.8%, respectively. The effective tax rates result primarily from our ability to tax benefit financial expenses including state taxes, to exclude from taxable income a portion of the distributions received from investments and the benefit from the research credit and the production activities deduction.
During the fourth quarter, the Company did not repurchase any outstanding common shares. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the company initiated repurchases of $8.4 million. The Company has repurchased a total of $48.2 million of the $120 million share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in fiscal 2007. The timing and amount of future share repurchases will be dependent upon certain governing loan covenants.
Revolving Credit Facility Extended:
At the end of fiscal 2007, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $350 million revolving credit facility that was to expire in May 2009. On July 12, 2007, the Company entered into a $500 million amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement ("Revolver") provides a revolving credit facility for up
to $500 million in revolving loans, including up to $25 million in swing-line loans. The Company will use proceeds of the Revolver to, among other things; pay off amounts outstanding under the Company's Term Loan Agreement dated February 11, 2005 with various financial institutions. The Revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the Revolver will be due and payable on July 12, 2012. The Revolver contains covenants that the Company considers usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, but does not contain a Minimum Net Worth Covenant. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Revolver. At any time during the term of the Revolver, the Company may, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are satisfied, elect to increase the maximum amount available under the Revolver from $500 million by up to an amount not to exceed $250 million through, at the Company's election, increases of commitments by existing lenders and/or the addition of new lenders.
Outlook:
For fiscal 2008, the Company projects that net income will be in the range of $60 to $70 million or $1.18 to $1.38 per diluted share. The estimate is based on the assumption that consolidated net sales will grow 9% to 10% between years primarily due to volume in the Engines Segment. The estimate assumes that there will be no hurricane activity in fiscal 2008. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 5.1% to 5.7%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $44 million and $11 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be 30% to 32%.

On August 7, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors modified the Corporation's existing cash bonus plan for senior executives and established a transition incentive plan for key employees. The Committee took these actions to maintain economic incentives for all affected officers and employees to achieve superior performance as the Corporation evolves from a manufacturer of engines to a provider of engines and end products.
The Compensation Committee modified the treatment of negative bonus bank balances for senior executives under the Corporation's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Article VIII of the Plan was amended to put a floor under negative bank balances and permit senior executives in some situations to receive immediately a portion of any bonus accrual that exceeds a target bonus. The floor on each senior executive's bank balance is negative one times his or her current target bonus, and a senior executive will receive 50% of his or her extraordinary bonus accrual when the executive has a negative bonus bank balance and the negative balance is more than half of the executive's extraordinary bonus accrual. These amendments reduce Mr. Shiely's negative bonus bank balance by $457,084, Mr. Teske's by $286,744, Mr. Brenn's by $102,664, and Mr. Savage's by $101,848.
The Compensation Committee also approved a Special Transition Incentive Program (the "STIP") to supplement the Plan for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010. The STIP permits a participant to earn a supplemental compensation award at the end of the fiscal year based on the achievement of specific performance goals that are established at the start of the year. A participant's STIP award may not exceed his or her target bonus under the Plan or other EVA-based bonus plan, and the STIP award will be paid in equal dollar amounts of cash and restricted or deferred stock. The Committee selected 26 key employees to participate in the STIP for fiscal year 2008, including Messrs. Shiely, Teske, Brenn and Savage. The amount of the STIP award that Messrs. Shiely, Teske, Brenn or Savage is eligible to receive for fiscal year 2008 depends on his total salary for the fiscal year, which ends on June 29, 2008. If each executive's salary for fiscal year 2008 would be the same as the salary he earned in fiscal year 2007, Mr. Shiely would be eligible for a STIP award not to exceed $937,500, Mr. Teske would be eligible for a STIP award not to exceed $375,336, and Messrs. Brenn and Savage would each be eligible for a STIP award not to exceed $219,002, with half of each award to be paid in cash and half in restricted or deferred stock.
The Plan and STIP are each authorized by the shareholder-approved Incentive Compensation Plan.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Relations Contact:
James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
Milwaukee, WI October 18, 2007/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced first quarter consolidated net sales of $366.7 million and a net loss of $20.5 million or $.41 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales increased $28.4 million or 8% from the prior year while the net loss increased $4.0 million from the same period a year ago. The $28.4 million consolidated net sales increase was the result of increased engine unit volume to external original equipment manufacturers and stronger shipments of lawn and garden equipment to independent dealers. The increase in the net loss of $4.0 million is primarily the result of expenses associated with the previously announced shutdown of our Rolla, Missouri engine manufacturing plant and expenses associated with opening our new lawn equipment plant in Newbern, Tennessee.
Engines:
Fiscal 2008 first quarter net sales were $208.4 million, an $18.8 million or 10% improvement from the prior year. This increase reflects 5% greater engine unit shipments compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in engine unit volume was attributable to good late season sell-through in certain regions of the United States. The sell-through, coupled with lower retail and OEM inventories and improved demand, resulted in replenishment orders for engines, a situation that did not exist in the first quarter a year ago. The majority of the remainder of the improvement was attributable to favorable Euro exchange rates.
There was a $10.2 million loss from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This was an $11.3 million improvement from the results reported for the same period a year ago. Included in the $10.2 million loss from operations was approximately $4.0 million of expenses related to the planned closure of the Rolla facility. Factoring out the Rolla closure expenses results in an improvement in operating income between years of $15.3 million that was the result of increased shipments, the Euro benefit and planned lower spending in both manufacturing and operating expense categories. Sales volumes contributed the majority of the increase but they were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix of engines with lower margins. Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were lower by $2.7 million primarily related to reduced marketing and advertising expenses and legal and professional fees.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2008 first quarter net sales were $187.0 million, basically the same as a year ago. While total segment net sales were consistent between years, shipments of lawn and garden equipment were approximately 12% greater than the prior year due to increased orders from dealers needing to replenish inventories due to demand during the summer months. Sales of portable generators were down approximately 47% from the same period a year ago. Both the current and last year's first quarters lacked demand created by landed-hurricanes. However, last year's first quarter did have the benefit of some generator replenishment demand created by tax holiday sales in Florida, while this year demand from the tax holiday event was negligible.
The first quarter of fiscal 2008 had a loss from operations of $10.6 million. This represents a $13.4 million decrease from the income from operations of $2.8 million generated in the same period a year ago. The reduction in operating income between years resulted from lower sales and production volumes of portable generators, increased costs related to components purchased in Euros and planned initial startup costs associated with the previously announced new lawn equipment plant located in Newbern, Tennessee.
Change in Accounting for Pension Assets:
Effective July 2, 2007, Briggs & Stratton has changed the method it uses to compute the market related value of the assets within its qualified defined benefit pension plan. The market related value of pension assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets. The Company believes that the new method is preferable as it more closely approximates the fair market value of the plan assets. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded pension income of $685,000 (pre-tax). Generally accepted accounting principles require that the impact of this change in accounting be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. As a result, all prior period financial statements have been restated to give effect to the cumulative impact of this change. The restated first quarter of fiscal 2007 now reflects pension income of $658,000 (pre-tax). After the restatement, the previously reported net operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 improved by $2.6 million (pre-tax).
General:
Other income is lower between years primarily because of the timing of when certain dividend income is received. The effective tax rate was at 31% versus the 34% used in the first quarter last year. The effective rate is less due to the impact of the fixed nature of certain tax credits available to the Company.
Revolving Credit Facility Extended:
On July 12, 2007, the Company entered into a $500 million amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement ("Revolver") provides a revolving credit facility for up to $500 million in revolving loans, including up to $25 million in swing-line loans. The Company used the proceeds of the Revolver to, among other things; pay off amounts outstanding under the Company's Term Loan Agreement dated February 11, 2005 with various financial institutions and retire the Senior Notes that were due in September 2007. The Revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the Revolver will be due and payable on July 12, 2012. The Revolver contains covenants that the Company considers usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, but does not contain a Minimum Net Worth Covenant. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Revolver.
Outlook:
Overall the results experienced in the first quarter were ahead of the Company's initial projections, particularly in the Engines Segment of the business. We believe channel inventories of lawn and garden products are at a normal level, which helps support our projection of the spring of 2008 market. In addition, while the placement of all products has not been decided at this time, we believe our forecast of our placement is still valid.
In the Power Products Segment we have seen good demand for pressure washer and lawn equipment and believe our projections for those products are obtainable. As indicated in our discussion of first quarter results, generator demand continues to be a challenge, even more so than first projected. The lack of even a threat of a storm thus far has further softened the base demand for generators.
We believe we need to make an additional adjustment of our forecast of sales of portable and standby generators for 2008 and even more of a concerted effort to reduce production levels to bring inventory levels down. As a result we believe the range of our net income forecast needs to be narrowed to $60 to $65 million or $1.21 to $1.31 per diluted share for the full year. The estimate is based on the assumption that consolidated net sales will grow approximately 7% to 8% between years primarily due to higher volume in the Engines Segment. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 5.1% to 5.4%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $40 million and $10 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be 30% to 32%.
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 847-7859. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

On November 27, 2007 Briggs & Stratton Corporation ("B&S") and Metal Technologies Holding Company, Inc. ("MTHC") entered into a Class B Preferred Share Redemption Agreement. The agreement provides for MTHC to pay all dividends in arrears on 45,000 MTHC Class B preferred shares held by B&S through the redemption date, and redeem the shares in exchange for a payment to B&S which shall occur no later than January 31, 2008.
B&S estimates it will receive $66.5 million from MTHC with respect to the Class B preferred shares on the projected redemption date resulting in income of $37.4 million. Only $10.0 million of related dividend income was projected in B&S's 2008 earnings forecast.
At the time MTHC redeems the preferred shares from B&S, Mr. Todd Teske and Mr. Thomas Savage, who are officers of B&S, will resign as directors of MTHC. In addition, once the stock redemption occurs, modifications to an existing supply agreement between B&S and MTHC's subsidiaries will take effect on July 1, 2008. The supply agreement, which covers the purchase by B&S of grey iron and ductile iron casting requirements at certain of its facilities, is being extended through June 30, 2013 and being modified in other respects.
B&S expects that it will use the proceeds from the share redemption for general corporate purposes.
 
Snow Thrower Engine Recall Expenses
On June 18, 2007, B&S in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission voluntarily recalled certain snow thrower engines due to a potential fire hazard. The recall impacted approximately 480,000 snow throwers sold at various snow thrower dealers nationwide from June 2000 through February 2007. Consumers were instructed to stop using the impacted snow throwers and were provided contact information for receiving free repairs.
B&S originally estimated the total cost of the recall to be approximately $5.0 million. Based upon the results to date B&S now believes that the total cost of the recall could be approximately $20 to $25 million. The company previously recognized a total of $7.0 million of these expenses, of which $5.0 million was recognized in fiscal year 2007 and $2.0 million was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. B&S anticipates that it will accrue an additional $13.0 to $18.0 million of expenses related to this recall in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. None of the fiscal year 2008 expenses related to this recall were included in B&S's 2008 earnings forecast.

James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
Milwaukee, WI January 17, 2008/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced second quarter fiscal 2008 consolidated net sales of $478.8 million and consolidated net income of $5.4 million or $.11 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 had consolidated net sales of $423.1 million and a consolidated net loss of $4.4 million or $.09 per diluted share. The $55.7 million, or 13%, increase in consolidated net sales in the second quarter was primarily due to volume improvement in most product categories. The $9.8 million improvement in second quarter consolidated net income reflects the impact of a $37.0 million gain ($25.0 million after tax) resulting from the sale of an investment in preferred stock including the final dividends paid on the preferred stock, offset by $17.7 million of warranty expense ($12.7 million after tax) for a previously announced snow engine recall. Operationally, the second quarter results were lower than last year's second quarter. Improved margins from increased sales were offset by costs incurred in the startup of new production in facilities for power products as well as the impact of costs incurred to close an engine facility. In addition, fixed costs were higher in the second quarter due to lower production levels that resulted from our plan to produce closer to the retail season.
For the first six months of fiscal 2008, the Company had consolidated net sales of $845.5 million and a consolidated net loss of $15.0 million or $.30 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $761.3 million and there was a consolidated net loss of $20.8 million or $.42 per diluted share. The increase in the first six month's consolidated net sales of the $84.2 million, or 11%, was primarily attributable to increased engine unit shipments. The $5.8 million increase in consolidated net income reflects the stock transaction that occurred in the second quarter, offset by $19.8 million of warranty expense ($13.5 million after tax) for the snow engine recall. Operationally, the six month results improved from the same period a year ago as the benefit of increased sales and lower manufacturing costs were greater than the higher expenses associated with operations startup, a plant closing and lower production levels.
Engines:
Fiscal 2008 second quarter net sales were $315.5 million versus $279.0 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 13%. The increase resulted primarily from a 10% increase in engine unit shipments between quarters. Sales for the first half of fiscal 2008 were $524.0 million versus $468.6 million in the prior year, a 12% increase. This increase in the first half of the year also reflects a 10% increase in engine unit shipments between years. Engine unit shipment increases in the quarter reflect improved placement for the upcoming season as well as some earlier demand for engines by some original equipment manufacturers. The first six months sales also benefited somewhat from stronger summer retail demand in certain regions for lawn and garden equipment.
The second quarter of fiscal 2008 had a loss from operations of $4.9 million, down $13.4 million from the income for operations for the same period a year ago. The major reason for the decrease in income from operations was the $17.7 million warranty expense associated with the snow engine recall. Income from operations did benefit from higher unit volumes, although the volume increase skewed to smaller displacement units which generate lower gross profits. In addition, margins increased due to favorable exchange rates for Euro denominated sales.
The loss from operations for the first half of fiscal 2008 was $15.1 million, a $2.1 million decline from the loss from operations of $13.0 million for the same period a year ago. For the six months, the negative impact on income from operations from the snow engine recall was $19.8 million. Operationally, income from operations showed improvement between years due to a favorable Euro exchange rate, increased sales volume and lower manufacturing expenses.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2008 second quarter net sales were $197.0 million, a $26.6 million increase from the same period a year ago. The improvement was primarily the result of increased shipments of portable generators and pressure washers.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2008 were $384.0 million, a $26.7 million increase over the same period a
year ago. The sales improvement was the result of unit shipment increases in pressure washers and certain lawn and garden products.
The loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $15.6 million, a decline of $11.6 million from the loss for the same period a year ago. The increase in the loss from operations was the result of startup costs for a new plant and new product models for the lawn and garden markets that did not exist in the second quarter a year ago. In addition, manufacturing costs related to materials and components have increased and fixed costs are up because of lower utilization at certain facilities.
The loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $26.2 million, a $25.0 million decline from the loss from operations for the same period a year ago. As in the second quarter, increased manufacturing costs and the costs of the startups make up the majority of the operating income decline.
General:
Interest expense was lower in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 because of lower average borrowings than last year due to reduced inventories. The second quarter and year to date fiscal 2008 effective tax rates are at 28% and 32%, respectively versus the 26% and 32% used in the same respective periods last year.
Other income in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 reflects the gain on the redemption of an investment in preferred stock and the associated dividends. There was no dividend income in the second quarter last year, but there was $2.0 million of dividends in other income for the first half of last year.
Outlook:
Our net income forecast for the year is $60 to $68 million or $1.21 to $1.37 per diluted share for the full year. The estimate is based on the assumption that consolidated net sales will grow approximately 7% to 8% between years, primarily due to higher volume in the Engines Segment. Operating income margins are projected to be approximately 4.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $36 million and $38 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in the range of 32% to 34%.
The top end of the projected range for net income was increased by $3.0 million to reflect the after tax benefit of the preferred stock transaction of $25 million. This benefit was offset by two factors. The first offset is a $9.0 million after tax benefit for dividends on the preferred stock that had already been in our forecast for fiscal 2008. The second offset is the $13 million after tax impact of the snow engine recall. The bottom end of the range remains unchanged because we feel we continue to face uncertain market conditions for the remainder of the fiscal year.
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (EST) on January 17, 2008 to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on its corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 802-4328. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
Briggs & Stratton today announced third quarter fiscal 2008 consolidated net sales of $724.8 million and consolidated net income of $37.1 million or $.75 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2007 had consolidated net sales of $717.0 million and consolidated net income of $9.3 million or $.18 per diluted share, that included a $35.2 million pretax ($21.4 million after tax or $.42 per diluted share) write-down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States. Consolidated net sales increased $7.8 million or 1%. The entire increase is due to improved sales in the Engines Segment partially offset by lower sales in the Power Products Segment, the result of lower sales volumes of pressure washer and generator products. Third quarter consolidated net income increased $27.8 million between years. The lack of a write-down of assets in fiscal 2008 improved net income by $21.4 million. The remainder of the improvement is primarily attributable to a lower effective tax rate between years.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, consolidated net sales were $1.570 billion and consolidated net income was $22.1 million or $.45 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1.479 billion, and the consolidated net loss was $10.8 million or $.22 per diluted share, including the $35.2 million pretax ($21.4 million after tax or $.43 per diluted share) write-down of assets discussed above for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The $91.0 million or 6% increase in consolidated net sales was primarily the result of improved engine sales and an increase in the volume of lawn and garden equipment shipments. The nine-month consolidated net income increased by $32.9 million between years. The improvement is the result of the aforementioned lack of a write-down of assets in fiscal 2008 that improved net income by $21.4 million and the $29.0 million after tax gain resulting from the sale of an investment in preferred stock that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Excluding the aforementioned items, income from operations was less than the prior year. Operationally, income from increased sales volume was more than offset by a sales mix that reflected lower margined product, start up and reconfiguration expenses associated with our Power Products operations and the impact of a $19.8 million ($12.7 million after tax) warranty expense for a previously announced snow engine recall.
Engines:
Fiscal third quarter net sales were $546.4 million versus $516.1 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $30.3 million or 6%. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of an engine unit shipment increase from the same period a year ago.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 were $1.070 billion versus $984.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $85.3 million or 9%. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of a 7% engine unit shipment increase from the same period a year ago and a more favorable exchange rate that benefited our sales made in Euros.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $65.7 million, up $50.3 million from $15.4 million during the same period in the prior year. Approximately $33.9 million of this improvement is attributable to the lack of a write-down of assets in fiscal 2008 that were incurred in the rationalization of a major operating plant in the United States in fiscal 2007. The balance of the improvement is the result of lower manufacturing spending, an improved exchange rate on sales denominated in Euros, improved utilization of the production facilities, and higher sales volume offset partially by a mix shift to lower margined engines.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $50.6 million, up $47.9 million from $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. As in the third quarter, $33.9 million of this improvement is attributable to the lack of a write-down of assets in fiscal 2008. The balance of the improvement resulted from increased sales and production volumes and an improved exchange rate on sales denominated in Euros partially offset by a mix shift to lower margined engines and the impact of a $19.8 million warranty expense associated with the snow engine recall.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2008 third quarter net sales were $240.8 million versus $248.7 million for the same period a year ago, a
decrease of $7.9 million. Sales of lawn and garden equipment grew between years due to increased placement. Offsetting the improvements in lawn and garden equipment shipments was the continued softness in demand for generator product and a small decline in pressure washer shipments ahead of the spring selling season. Major retailers have adequate inventories and appear to be controlling inventory replenishment levels very tightly as they try to navigate through the weak economy.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 were $624.8 million versus $607.0 million in the prior year, an $17.8 million increase. The sales improvement was the result of unit shipment increases in pressure washers and certain lawn and garden products during the first half of fiscal 2008.
There was a loss from operations of $9.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, a decline of $15.6 million between years. This decline was the result of sales shifting to a mix of lower margined products as well as from approximately $5.8 million in start up costs for a new plant and new product models for the lawn and garden market that did not exist in the third quarter a year ago.
The loss from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $36.0 million, a decline of $41.6 million from the operating income generated for the same period a year ago. Sales volume improvement, primarily for lawn and garden equipment, increased operating income but was more than offset by $12.6 million of increased expenses and lower utilization at certain of our lawn and garden equipment manufacturing plants in conjunction with the start up and reconfiguration of those operations. Another contributor to the decline was an unfavorable mix of sales to lower margined product, primarily in the generator and pressure washer equipment categories.
Change in Accounting for Pension Assets:
Effective July 2, 2007, Briggs & Stratton has changed the method it uses to compute the market related value of the assets within its qualified defined benefit pension plan. The market related value of pension assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets. The company believes that the new method is preferable as it more closely approximates the fair market value of the plan assets. For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2008, the company recorded pre-tax pension income of $1.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Generally accepted accounting principles require that the impact of this change in accounting be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. As a result, all prior period financial statements have been restated to give effect to the cumulative impact of this change. The restated three and nine months ended April 1, 2007 now reflects pre-tax pension income of $0.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
General:
Other income was less in the fiscal 2008 third quarter because last year's third quarter contained a dividend on a preferred stock investment. The preferred stock was redeemed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and other income for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 reflects the gain on the redemption of the preferred stock and the associated dividends. Interest expense is less in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 due to lower borrowings for working capital and lower average interest rates. The effective tax rate is 16.9% for the third quarter and 2.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 versus 40.2% and 23.3% for the same periods last year, respectively. The variation reflected between years is due to the required recognition of the tax effects of certain events as discrete items in the quarter they occur in rather than in the overall expected annual tax rate. In addition, the impact of expected tax credits as a percentage of annual earnings for fiscal 2008 results in lowering the projected effective tax rate in fiscal 2008. We expect the effective rate for the full fiscal 2008 to be in the 23.0% to 25.0% range.
Restatement of Prior Year Results:
During the quarter ended March 30, 2008, the company identified errors in its previously filed financial statements on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2007, July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005 related to three separate items. First, the company did not properly expense rebates to certain customers in each year. Second, the company identified that certain inter-company receivable and payable accounts were out of balance, primarily related to transactions in fiscal 2004. Third, the company has historically incorrectly capitalized warranty costs into inventory.
The impact to the company's previously reported net income and earnings per diluted share is an increase of $0.2 million ($.00 per diluted share) for fiscal 2007, a reduction of $2.3 million ($.04 per diluted share) for fiscal 2006 and a reduction of $1.8 million ($.04 per diluted share) for fiscal 2005. Certain of the misstatements occurred in years prior to fiscal 2005. The cumulative effect of correcting these errors will reduce retained earnings by $2.7 million at June 27, 2004.
The impact to the three and nine months ended April 1, 2007 reported in this earnings release is a reduction of net income of $0.1 million ($.00 per diluted share) and an increase in net income of $0.7 million ($.01 per diluted share), respectively.
We do not believe that these restatements are material to the company's results of operations for any of the individual previously filed annual or quarterly financial statements.
Outlook:
Our unit shipment activity for nine months is stronger than it was a year ago by 7% in the Engines Segment and 12% in the Power Products Segment. However, we are now in a prime part of the spring selling season and it appears retail sales of powered equipment have started slowly. We are also aware that equipment manufacturers and retailers are being very mindful of their working capital levels due to uncertainty in the U.S. economy. Consequently, we are providing a forecast that reflects the potential risk we see in the market at this time. The forecast reflects unit volume in the Engines Segment that now will be comparable to fiscal 2007 shipments and our outlook for pressure washer product is also being revised downward to slightly under fiscal 2007 levels. Our forecast reflects our intention to keep our production levels up through May so that if the potential risk does not materialize we can satisfy demand; if we come to the end of May and the demand decline has occurred, we presently plan to scale back production for the rest of the fiscal year to control our working capital investment. The current forecast reflects a lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes and production levels in both Segments. The forecast now contemplates full year consolidated net sales of approximately $2.2 billion, operating income margins in the 1.7% to 1.9% range, interest expense and other income at $37 million and $40 million, respectively, and an effective tax rate for the full year in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. This results in a net income forecast for the year in the range of $30 to $35 million or $.60 to $.71 per diluted share for the full year.

On June 3, 2008, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. of Sydney, Australia from GUD Holdings Limited for a total consideration of $22 million in cash. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
MILWAUKEE, WI June 3, 2008/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. of Sydney, Australia from GUD Holdings Limited for a total consideration of $22 million in cash, subject to adjustments. Briggs & Stratton's subsidiary Briggs & Stratton Australia Pty. Limited is a party to the transaction.
Victa Lawncare is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of outdoor power equipment used in consumer lawn and garden applications in Australia and New Zealand. Its products are sold at large retail stores and independent dealers. Victa Lawncare had net sales of $56 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 and anticipates net sales of approximately $64 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 2008.
Briggs & Stratton anticipates financing the transaction from cash on hand and/or its existing credit facilities. It expects that the acquisition will have no material effect on earnings in fiscal 2009. Cost synergies from the transaction are expected to be modest.
Completion of the transaction is subject to conditions customarily associated with a transaction of this type. The transaction is targeted for closing at the beginning of Briggs & Stratton's fiscal 2009 first quarter, at which time Victa Lawncare will become a subsidiary of Briggs & Stratton Australia Pty. Limited.
"The acquisition brings together two of the leading companies in outdoor power products in Australia and New Zealand, and allows each company to continue to employ its core competencies. Briggs & Stratton will continue to focus on supplying engines to consumer and commercial power customers in Australia and New Zealand, and Victa Lawncare will continue to manufacture and market lawnmowers for its customers," stated Todd Teske, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation.
"This is a very positive outcome for Victa customers and for Briggs & Stratton. The Victa business has benefited from low cost components, new product development, and broader distribution strategies in recent years. Victa's brand strength and current operational performance can only add to the strength of a company like Briggs & Stratton," said Ian Campbell, GUD Holdings' Managing Director.
Briggs & Stratton Corporation is the world's largest producer of gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment. Its wholly owned subsidiary Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC is North America's number one manufacturer of portable generators and pressure washers, and is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of lawn and garden and turf care. These products are sold through consumer home centers, department stores, mass merchants, warehouse clubs and independent dealers.

(414) 259-5333
Milwaukee, WI October 16, 2008/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced fiscal 2009 first quarter consolidated net sales of $458.2 million and a net loss of $2.0 million or $.04 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales increased $91.1 million or 25% from the prior year while the net loss improved by $18.9 million from the same period a year ago. The $91.1 million consolidated net sales increase was primarily the result of stronger shipments of both portable generators and engines. The improvement in the net loss of $18.9 million was also the result of improved sales volumes in both reportable segments.
Engines:
Fiscal 2009 first quarter net sales were $258.6 million, $50.2 million or 24% greater than the prior year. This increase reflects a 27% increase in engine unit shipments compared to the same period a year ago. The improvement in engine unit volume was in part attributable to low channel inventories of lawn and garden equipment that needed to be replenished because of ongoing demand during the summer. In addition, there was strong demand for engines for portable generators due to weather events, and snow thrower product in anticipation of the upcoming snow season.
The fiscal 2009 first quarter loss from operations was $5.5 million, an improvement of $5.7 million or 51% over the loss from operations of $11.2 million experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvement over the prior year was driven by the increase in sales volume and savings of approximately $4.0 million resulting from the closing of the Rolla, Missouri manufacturing facility that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvements to operating income were partially offset by a mix of engines sold with lower profit margins and manufacturing cost increases caused by higher commodity costs and certain increases in overhead expenses.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2009 first quarter net sales were $255.5 million, $68.1 million or 36% greater than the prior year. The increase in sales was primarily due to increased sales of portable generators due to a number of hurricanes making landfall in the United States in our first quarter. There was no storm activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Additionally, sales of $13.2 million were included in the results for the first time due to the June 30, 2008 acquisition of Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. discussed below.
The fiscal 2009 first quarter income from operations was $2.6 million, an improvement of $12.9 million from the loss from operations of $10.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvement in income from operations between years resulted in part from higher sales and production volumes of portable generators combined with an improvement year over year in portable generator margins and lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses.
General:
Interest expense was lower between years because of lower outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates. The effective tax rate was 71% versus the 31% used in the first quarter last year. The effective tax rate was higher for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 due to the benefit from resolution of federal tax matters.
Acquisition of Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd.
On June 30, 2008 Briggs & Stratton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Briggs & Stratton Australia, Pty Limited, acquired Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. ("Victa") of Sydney, Australia from GUD Holdings Limited for total consideration of $24.8 million in net cash. Victa is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of outdoor power equipment used in consumer lawn and garden applications in Australia and New Zealand. Victa's products are sold at large retail stores and independent dealers. Victa had net sales of approximately $57 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. The Company financed the transaction from cash on hand and its existing credit facilities. The Company expects that the acquisition will not have a material effect on earnings in fiscal 2009.
Outlook:
The Company has expanded its projected range of net income and is now estimating a range from $40 to $50 million or $0.81 to $1.01 per diluted share for the full year. This range reflects the impact of increased portable generator sales in the first quarter that were not in our initial projections for the year. It also continues to reflect our belief that channel inventories of lawn and garden products are at normal levels as the 2008 season comes to an end and our projections related to our product placement for fiscal 2009 are still valid. However, the forecast range now also reflects the risk that the sales of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers in the spring of 2009 may be weaker than projected. This could occur because the financial turmoil now taking place is significantly affecting consumer confidence and may also lead channel participants (retailers and equipment manufacturers) to review their working capital commitment. The negative influence of either, or both, of these factors could cause the market for our engines and end products to decline greater than others are forecasting at this time.
The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 818-1393. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week. Dial (888) 266-2081 to access the replay. The pass code will be 1289289.

Exhibit 99.1
Milwaukee, WI  November 20, 2008/PR Newswire/Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") today announced that William H. Reitman, Senior Vice President, Sales and Customer Support, has entered into an individual stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. Reitman informed the Company that under his trading plan he intends to sell 15,160 shares of Company common stock that would be issued as a result of the exercise of stock options that will expire in August 2009. The purpose of the plan is to provide Mr. Reitman with the ability to exercise his expiring options and sell the underlying Company common stock in an orderly manner and avoid concerns about the timing of the transactions.
The amount that Mr. Reitman may realize from the exercise of any options will be the number of options exercised multiplied by the amount by which the net selling prices of the Company's stock on the dates the stock options are exercised exceed the exercise prices of the stock options.
Other Company executives may from time to time adopt Rule 10b5-1 plans.

On December 8, 2008, Briggs & Stratton Corporation modified the form employment agreements and change of control agreements it has with each company officer. The modifications address changes in the law concerning deferred compensation, non-competition and the tax deductibility of incentive compensation payments. The agreements were last revised in November 2007, and a summary of the agreements including the amounts payable under them is contained in the company's annual proxy statement dated September 10, 2008 related to the company's 2008 annual meeting of shareholders.
(e) Modified Compensatory Plan.
The employment agreements have been revised to eliminate a six month moratorium on the payment of base compensation when the employee is terminated. The six month moratorium was inserted in both form agreements in November 2007 to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. It now appears that a six month moratorium is not necessary in all cases. Accordingly, the employment agreement is revised to provide a lump sum payment of base compensation 30 days after termination of employment. This revision replaces bi-weekly payments of base compensation after a six month moratorium.
The employment agreements have also been modified with respect to an officer's obligations after his or her employment with the company is terminated. The post-employment prohibition against working for a competitor is eliminated, while prohibitions against soliciting customers, using confidential information and trade secrets, and hiring B&S employees are clarified.
The change of control agreements have been revised to preserve the tax deductibility of any cash compensation exceeding $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers at the company, other than the chief financial officer. The amendments state that, during the three-year period after a change of control occurs, any cash bonus paid under the company's Incentive Compensation Plan that is based on the current year's performance will be in addition to the annual bonus and lump sum payments required by the change of control agreement. It is a matter of Board discretion whether to maintain an incentive compensation plan for officers based on current year performance.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the form agreements are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by references to them, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the day of , 20, by and between (the "Employee") and BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation with its corporate office in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin (the "Company").
    
            
    
                    
WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee in the business of manufacturing, selling and servicing gasoline powered engines or in such other businesses as the Company may from time to time engage (the "Business"), and Employee desires to be employed by the Company for such purpose; and
WHEREAS, Employee shall have access to confidential financial information, trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information of the Company;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
1. EMPLOYMENT
1.1 The Company shall employ Employee upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Employee shall have such duties at such work locations as may be assigned to Employee from time to time by the Company.
Duties.
1.2 Employee agrees to devote his best efforts and his full time and attention to the performance of his duties under this Agreement, and to perform such duties in an efficient, trustworthy and businesslike manner.
Best Efforts.
1.3 Employee shall not act in any manner, directly or indirectly, which may damage the business of the Company or which would adversely affect the goodwill, reputation or business relations of the Company with its customers, the public generally or with any of its other employees.
Duty to Act in the Best Interest of the Company.
2. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT
2.1 The term of Employee's employment with the Company under this Agreement shall commence as of , 20 (the "Effective Date"), and shall expire January 1, 20 ("Expiration Date"). In the event that neither the Company nor the Employee shall give written notice to the other party by December 1 of each year that this Agreement shall not be further extended, the Expiration Date shall be automatically extended by one additional year. If such notice is given, this Agreement shall expire on the last determined Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and Employee's employment may be terminated at any time as provided for in Sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 of this Agreement.
Term.
            
    
    
    
2.2 The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment for the following causes (each a "Termination for Cause"):
Termination for Cause.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that termination of Employee for an act or omission described in subparagraphs (c) through (g) above shall not constitute a valid Termination for Cause unless Employee shall have received written notice on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company by its Chairman or designee stating the nature of the conduct forming the basis for termination and affording Employee 10 days to correct the act or omission described. Unless Employee cures such act or omission to the satisfaction of the Company, such Termination for Cause shall be effective immediately upon the expiration of the 10 day period. Upon the effectiveness of any Termination for Cause by the Company, payment of all compensation to Employee under this Agreement shall cease immediately (except for any payment of compensation accrued but unpaid through the date of such Termination for Cause).
2.3
Termination by the Company Without Cause.
(a) The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment without cause upon 10 days' written notice to Employee. If the Company terminates this Agreement and Employee's employment without cause pursuant to this Section 2.3, Employee shall receive in a single lump sum within 30 days after the date of termination an amount equal to the Base Compensation, as that term is defined in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, the Employee would have received for the remainder of the
 
then current term of this Agreement had the Employee not been terminated, and for the remainder of such term shall be entitled to continue pre-existing coverage for himself and any dependents under any applicable medical plans described in Section 3.4 of this Agreement as long as the Employee continues to make the same monthly payments and copayments which would have been applicable if the Employee's employment had not been terminated. Following the date of termination of employment, Employee shall not receive any further compensation pursuant to Sections 3.2, 3.3 or the non-medical benefits described in Section 3.4 of this Agreement except as required by the terms of such benefit plans. In the event of termination without cause, Employee acknowledges that the Company shall have no liability to the Employee whatsoever other than its obligation to make the lump sum payment described above and to provide continuation of coverage under any applicable medical plans for the remainder of the then current term of this Agreement, and subsequently to provide the Employee with medical benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 as amended ("COBRA") and other benefits to which the Employee may be entitled under the terms of any benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with the terms thereof notwithstanding termination of his employment.
(b) It is intended that (i) each payment or installment of payments provided under this Agreement is a separate "payment" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and (ii) the payments satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A, including those provided under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(4) (regarding short-term deferrals), 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (regarding the two-times, two year exception), and 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) (regarding reimbursements and other separation pay). Any amounts which don't meet the short term deferral exception but do meet the two-times/two year exception shall be paid no later than the last day of the second year following the year in which occurs the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any payments to be provided to Employee do not qualify under the exemptions from Section 409A described in the first sentence of this paragraph (b) and are not otherwise exempt from Section 409A, then such nonqualifying payments shall be delayed until the date that is six (6) months after the date of termination. Any delayed payments shall be made in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, if the provision of medical benefits coverage pursuant to paragraph (a) above would be discriminatory within the meaning of Section 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, then to the extent necessary to prevent such discrimination, the Employee shall pay the full cost of such coverage (including both the normal Employee and Company share) and shall not be reimbursed by the Company for doing so.
(d) In order to facilitate compliance with Section 409(A) of the Internal Revenue Code and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary:
(i) except for the 6 month delay described in paragraph (b) above, the Company and the Employee shall neither accelerate nor defer or otherwise change the time at which any payment due under this Agreement is to be made, and
 
(ii) the date of termination of employment of the Employee shall be determined in a manner consistent with the definition of "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder.
2.4 If Employee is unable to perform his duties under this Agreement by reason of physical or mental disability, or if Employee should die during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate and all payments to Employee under this Agreement shall cease immediately (except for any payment of compensation accrued but unpaid through the date of termination, COBRA benefits and other benefits to which the Employee may be entitled notwithstanding termination of his employment). The term "disability" as used herein shall mean a condition which prohibits Employee from performing his duties substantially in the manner he is capable of performing them on the date of this Agreement, which cannot be removed by reasonable accommodations on the part of the Company, for 60 days or more during any one year period.
Termination Due to Disability or Death.
3. COMPENSATION
3.1 Subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement the Company shall pay to Employee an annual salary ("Base Compensation"), which salary shall be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Such Base Compensation shall in no event be lower than the salary of the previous year. Employee acknowledges that $2,000 of each year's Base Compensation is consideration for the covenant made by Employee in Section 5.2 of this Agreement against post-employment competition, and that the amount of such consideration is reasonable and adequate.
Base Compensation.
3.2 Subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this Agreement, in addition to the Base Compensation referred to in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, Employee shall be eligible to participate in any incentive pay plan adopted by the Board of Directors for a group of employees that includes executive officers.
Incentive Compensation.
3.3 During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse Employee for all ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred by him in connection with the Business, upon submission by Employee to the Company of vouchers itemizing such expenses in a form satisfactory to the Company, properly identifying the nature and business purpose of any such expenditure.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses.
3.4 During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall be entitled to participate in such insurance, medical and retirement plans and to be provided such other fringe benefits as have been accorded other similarly-situated employees of the Company, as determined from time to time by the Company.
Benefits.
 
4. PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY/ASSIGNMENT
Employee agrees that the Business and all businesses developed by him relating to the Business, including without limitation software, contracts, fees, commissions, customer lists and any other incident of any business developed or sought by the Company, or earned or carried on by Employee for the Company, are and shall be the exclusive property of the Company for its sole use.
Employee hereby grants and assigns to the Company (without additional compensation) his entire right, title and interest under applicable laws in and to all software products and modifications thereto, inventions, improvements, drawings, designs, prototypes, patents, patent applications, trade secrets, confidential information, cost information, marketing plans, new product plans, proposed product improvements, research information, customer lists and customer contacts, all other technical and research data, and copyrightable material (including derivative works) made, conceived, developed or acquired by him solely or jointly with others during the period of his employment by the Company, but only to the extent the foregoing pertains to the Business. During the term of his employment with the Company and for two years after the termination of his employment with the Company for any reason, Employee shall execute all documents as requested by Company to accomplish such assignment of rights, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Company and its attorneys in the protection and enforcement of the Company's intellectual property rights, at the expense of Company.
5. COVENANTS OF NON-DISCLOSURE, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION
5.1 The Employee agrees during his/her employment with the Company he/she shall not, directly or indirectly, either individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant or in any other capacity, participate in, engage in or have a financial or other interest in any business which is in competition with the Company or any successor or assignee of the Company. The ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of a publicly-traded company or 20% of a private company's securities or profits, even though that corporation may be a competitor of the Company, shall not be deemed financial participation in a competitor.
Non-Competition During Employment.
5.2 The Employee agrees that, upon voluntary or involuntary termination of employment with the Company and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he/she will not, directly or indirectly, individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant, or in any other capacity, canvass, contact, solicit or accept any of the Company's customers with whom the Employee had contact during the two (2) year period preceding his/her termination for the purpose of providing services, products or business that are in competition with the services, products or business which the Company provides to such customers. It is understood and agreed that the fluid customer list limitation contemplated by the parties closely approximates the area of the Company's vulnerability to unfair competition by Employee and does not deprive Employee of legitimate competitive opportunities to which he/she is entitled.
Non-Competition After Employment.
 
5.3 The Employee further agrees that during the term of his/her employment and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he/she will not interfere with or attempt to impair the relationship between the Company and any of its employees nor will the Employee attempt, directly or indirectly, to solicit, entice, or otherwise induce any other employee to terminate his/her association with the Company. The term "solicit, entice or induce" includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) initiating communications with an employee of the Company relating to possible employment; (b) offering bonuses or additional compensation to encourage employees of the Company to terminate their employment and accept employment with a competitor, supplier or customer of the Company; (c) referring employees of the Company to personnel or agents employed or engaged by competitors, suppliers or customers of the Company; or (d) referring personnel or agents employed or engaged by competitors, suppliers or customers of the Company to employees of the Company.
Impairment of Company's Relationships.
5.4.
Non-Disclosure of Information
(a) As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all information whether generated by the Company or by a third party at the Company's request, disclosed by the Company to Employee during the period of the Employee's employ with the Company, including, without limitation, trade secrets, design documents, copyright material, inventions, technology, processes, marketing data, business strategies, financial information and records, product information (including, without limitation, any product designs, specifications, capabilities, drawings, diagrams, blueprints, models and similar items), customer and prospective customer lists, supplier and vendor lists, product pricing formulas, software and similar information, in any form (whether oral, electronic, written, graphic or other printed form or obtained from access to or observation of the Company's facilities or operations). Confidential Information does not include information or data which is:
Confidential Information.
(1) at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, available to the general public by publication or otherwise through (i) no fault or negligence of the Employee or (ii) no breach of this Agreement by Employee;
(2) in the possession of the Employee prior to disclosure thereof by the Company as evidenced by written records of the Employee prepared prior to the date of disclosure of such information to the Employee;
(3) independently developed by the Employee without the benefit of any of the Confidential Information as evidenced by the written records of the Employee prepared to the date of disclosure of such information to the Employee; or
(4) disclosed to Employee by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality to the Company with respect to the information so disclosed.
 
(b) The parties also acknowledge that certain of the Company's Confidential Information is a trade secret ("Trade Secret") as that term is defined in Sec. 134.90(1)(c) of the Wisconsin Uniform Trade Secrets Act,
Trade Secrets.
i.e. information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process, that (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstance to maintain its secrecy.

Exhibit 10.2
AGREEMENT by and between Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company") and (the "Executive"), dated as of the day of , 20.
                            
        
                    
        
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
1. . (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company or this Agreement is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment or of this Agreement (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment or purported termination of this Agreement.
Certain Definitions
(b) The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate three years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.
2. . For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean:
Change of Control
(a) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this Section 2; or
(b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c) Approval by the shareholders of the Company and the subsequent consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or
(d) Approval by the shareholders of the Company and the subsequent consummation of (i) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than to a corporation, with respect to which following such sale or other disposition, (A) more than 60% of, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in substantially the same
 
proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (B) less than 20% of, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation), except to the extent that such Person owned 20% or more of the Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities prior to the sale or disposition and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such sale or other disposition of assets of the Company or were elected, appointed or nominated by the Board.
3. . The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of such date (the "Employment Period").
Employment Period
4. . (a) . (i) During the Employment Period, (A) the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date and (B) the Executive's services shall be performed at the location where the Executive was employed immediately preceding the Effective Date or any office or location less than 35 miles from such location.
Terms of Employment
Position and Duties
(ii) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal business hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. During the Employment Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Company.
(b) . (i) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary ("Annual Base Salary"), which shall be paid at a monthly rate, at least equal to twelve times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any base salary which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. During the Employment
Compensation
Base Salary
 
Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed no more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at least annually and shall be first increased no more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at least annually by the higher of (x) the average increase (excluding promotional increases) in base salary awarded to the Executive for each of the three full fiscal years (annualized in the case of any fiscal year consisting of less than twelve full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than twelve months) prior to the Effective Date, and (y) the percentage increase (excluding promotional increases) in base salary generally awarded to peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies for the year of determination. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase and the term Annual Base Salary as utilized in this Agreement shall refer to Annual Base Salary as so increased. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliated companies" shall include any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.
(ii) . In addition to Annual Base Salary, the Executive shall be awarded, for each fiscal year ending during the Employment Period, an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") in cash at least equal to the higher of (x) the average of the three highest bonuses paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the five fiscal years (or such shorter period during which the Executive has been employed by the Company) immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Effective Date occurs (annualized for any fiscal year during such period consisting of less than twelve full months or with respect to which the Executive has been employed by the Company for less than twelve full months) and (y) the bonus paid or payable (annualized as described above), including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the Effective Date (such higher amount being referred to as the "Recent Annual Bonus"). Each such Annual Bonus shall be paid no later than the end of the third month of the fiscal year next following the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded, (but in any event no later than March 15th following the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded) unless the Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus pursuant to the provisions of any otherwise applicable deferred compensation plan or arrangement. In the event that (a) despite the requirement of this subparagraph (ii), the Annual Bonus for any fiscal year during the Employment Period is less than the Recent Annual Bonus (as a result of either a reduction in the targeted bonus amounts, or a failure to meet performance goals), or (b) the Executive's services are terminated during any fiscal year, the amount and timing of the cash bonus for such fiscal year (payable under Section 9 of the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan) shall not be affected by any payments made under Section 6 below.
Annual Bonus
(iii) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all incentive, savings and retirement plans, practices, policies and programs applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to both regular and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that such distinction is applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit opportunities, in each case, less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of those provided by the Company and its affiliated companies for the Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
Incentive, Savings and Retirement Plans

During the Employment Period, the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company and its affiliated companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary continuance, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs) to the extent applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with benefits which are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
Welfare Benefit Plans
(v) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in accordance with the most favorable policies, practices and procedures of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
Expenses
(vi) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to fringe benefits, including, without limitation, tax and financial planning services, payment of club dues, and, if applicable, use of an automobile and payment of related expenses, in accordance with the most favorable plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.

In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative (such agreement as to acceptability not to be withheld unreasonably).
(b) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For the sole and exclusive purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
Cause
(i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(c) . The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For the sole and exclusive purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
Good Reason
(i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this
 
Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
(ii) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
(iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
(iv) any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
(v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 5(c), any good faith determination of "Good Reason" made by the Executive shall be conclusive. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a termination by the Executive for any reason during the 30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall be deemed to be a termination for Good Reason for all purposes of this Agreement.
(d) . Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
(e) . "Date of Termination" means (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

(in the case of Section 4(b)(i)(y) based on increases (excluding promotional increases) in base salary for the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the Date of Termination) had the Executive remained employed, and (2) the Executive's annual bonus (annualized for any fiscal year consisting of less than twelve full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than twelve full months) in each of the three years bears the same proportion to the Executive's base salary in such year or fraction thereof as it did for the last full year prior to the Date of Termination, and (b) the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination;
(ii) for three years after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(iv) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated in accordance with the most favorable plans, practices, programs or policies of the Company and its affiliated companies applicable generally to other peer executives and their families during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families, provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until two and one-half years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period except to the extent the providing of such service credit would cause a benefit to be discriminatory or violate a qualification rule under Internal Revenue Code Section 79 or 105(h) or other applicable Code rule;
(iii) the Company shall, on the first day of the eighth month following the Date of Termination reimburse the Executive for outplacement services received by the Executive during the first six (6) months after the date of termination, the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in his sole discretion; and
(iv) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits") and such payments shall be provided at such times and in such amounts as called for by the terms of such Other Benefits arrangements.
(b) . If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement, other than
Death
 
for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(b) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of peer executives of the Company and such affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to death benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other peer executives and their beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive's estate and/or the Executive's beneficiaries, as in effect on the date of the Executive's death with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their beneficiaries.
(c) . If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. The Accrued Obligations shall be paid to Executive at the same times as specified in Section 6(a)(i)(A)(B) and (C). With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(c) shall include, and the Executive shall be entitled after the Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at least equal to the most favorable of those generally provided by the Company and its affiliated companies to disabled executives and/or their families in accordance with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to disability, if any, as in effect generally with respect to other peer executives and their families at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families.
Disability
(d) . If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than the obligation to, within 30 days of the Date of Termination, pay to the Executive his Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination. Also, Executive shall also be paid the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive under any other plan or arrangement at such times and in such amounts provided therein, and Other Benefits, to the extent theretofore unpaid and such payments of Other Benefits shall be provided at such times and in such amounts as called for by the terms of such Other Benefits arrangements. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits to be provided at such times and in such amounts as called for by the terms of such Other Benefits arrangements. In such case, the Accrued Obligations shall be paid to Executive at the same times as specified in Section 6(a)(i)(A)(B) and (C).
Cause; Other than for Good Reason
(e) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6 to the contrary, to the extent any benefits provided pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) and (iv) or Other Benefits pursuant to Section 6(c) during the first six (6) months after Executive's Date of Termination are not paid pursuant to a qualified plan, a bona fide sick leave or vacation plan, a disability plan, a death benefit plan or a plan providing medical expense reimbursements which are non-taxable or a separation pay plan (within the meaning of regulations under Code Section 409(A)), Executive shall pay the cost of such coverage during the first six (6) months following Executive's Date
Limitations
 
of Termination and shall be reimbursed by the Company for the cost of such coverage on the first day of the seventh month after Executive's Date of Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6 to the contrary, including the preceding sentence, if the provision of medical benefits coverage called for herein would be discriminatory within the meaning of Section 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, then, to the extent necessary to prevent such discrimination, Executive (or his survivors, as the case may be) shall pay the cost of all such coverage and neither Executive nor his survivors, as the case may be, shall be reimbursed by the Company for doing so.
7. . Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
Non-exclusivity of Rights
8. . The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Full Settlement
9. .
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
 
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive to the Company that there has been a Payment (which notice must be provided by March 1 of the year following the year in which the Payment is made), or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. To comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, any payment of an Underpayment by the Company or payment of expenses by the Company under paragraph (c) below shall in any event be made by the end of the Executive's taxable year following the Executive's taxable year in which the taxes that are the subject of the audit or litigation are remitted to the taxing authority, or where as a result of such audit or litigation no taxes are remitted, the end of the Executive's taxable year following the Executive's taxable year in which the audit is completed or there is a final and nonappealable settlement or other resolution of the litigation.
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
10. . The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
Confidential Information
 
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
11. . (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
Successors
(b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
(c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
12. . (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Relations Contact:
James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
MILWAUKEE, WI January 15, 2009/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced second quarter fiscal 2009 consolidated net sales of $477.5 million and consolidated net income of $3.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2008 had consolidated net sales of $477.5 million and consolidated net income of $4.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales were essentially the same between years; however, the Engines Segment sales were greater than last year and the Power Products Segment sales were lower. The prior year's second quarter results included two significant items, a $37.0 million gain ($25.0 million after tax) resulting from the sale of an investment in preferred stock including the final dividend paid on the preferred stock, offset by a $17.7 million warranty expense ($12.7 million after tax) for a snow engine recall. Excluding these items, net income improved $11.4 million from last year resulting from a more favorable mix of product both shipped and manufactured, offset in part by commodity costs that were higher than in the same period a year ago.
For the first six months of fiscal 2009, the company had consolidated net sales of $935.6 million and consolidated net income of $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $844.6 million and there was a consolidated net loss of $16.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share. The increase in the first six months' consolidated net sales of $91.0 million, or 11%, was attributable to stronger shipments of both engines and portable generators. Excluding the preferred stock event and snow engine recall, net income improved $29.4 million reflecting improved sales results and higher production volumes in both operating segments, offset in part by commodity costs that were higher than in the same period a year ago.
Engines:
Fiscal 2009 second quarter net sales were $339.3 million versus $315.5 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 8%. The increase resulted primarily from an 11% increase in engine unit shipments between quarters driven by increased engine requirements for portable generator and snow removal equipment.
Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2009 were $597.9 million versus $524.0 million in the prior year, a 14% increase. This improvement reflects a 16% increase in engine unit shipments between years. The first six months sales improvement in engine unit volume resulted from strong demand for engines for portable generators due to weather events, and snow removal product for the current snow season. In addition, engine demand resulted from low channel inventories of lawn and garden equipment that needed to be replenished because of retail demand during the first fiscal quarter.
The second quarter of fiscal 2009 had income from operations of $22.0 million, up $27.9 million from the same period a year ago. The year over year increase in income from operations was positively impacted by the absence of the $17.7 million warranty expense associated with the snow engine recall in fiscal 2008. The remainder of the improved income from operations resulted from an 11% increase in shipments, production volumes that were 3% greater than the prior year and planned reductions of selected operating expenses. The improvements to income from operations were offset by commodity costs that continue to be higher than they were in the previous year.
Income from operations for the first half of fiscal 2009 was $16.5 million, a $33.6 million increase over the loss from operations of $17.1 million for the same period a year ago. For the six-month period, the absence of $19.8 million of warranty expense associated with the snow engine recall in the same period in fiscal 2008 contributed positively to the improvement in income from operations. Additionally, the improved income from operations resulted primarily from the 16% increase in sales volume, with 3% greater production volumes and planned reductions of selected operating expenses. Again, a major offset to the improvement in income from operations was commodity costs that were higher than they were in the previous year. In addition, pricing on engines sold to Europe was less favorable than last year due to currency fluctuations.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2009 second quarter net sales were $192.0 million, a $3.7 million decrease from the same period a year ago. The lower net sales were primarily the result of decreased shipments of pressure washer product. Demand for this product softened between years as consumer sentiment weakened. An offset to the net sales decrease was $12.0 million of sales related to our June 30, 2008 acquisition of Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. ("Victa").
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2009 were $447.5 million, a $64.4 million increase over the same period a year ago. The sales improvement was the result of the Victa acquisition ($25.2 million) and increased sales of portable generators due to a number of hurricanes making landfall in the United States in our first quarter of fiscal 2009. The strong portable generator demand was partially offset by the weaker pressure washer product demand in the second quarter.
The loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $8.6 million, an improvement of $8.3 million over the loss for the same period a year ago. The improvement was primarily the result of a favorable mix of portable generator unit shipments and better plant utilization caused by ongoing portable generator demand. Pricing improvement experienced in the quarter was offset by the increased cost of commodities and components.
The loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was $6.0 million, a $21.1 million improvement over the loss from operations for the same period a year ago. The improvement in income from operations between years resulted in part from higher sales and production volumes combined with an improvement year over year in margins resulting from a favorable product mix and lower engineering, selling and administrative expenses.
General:
Interest expense was lower in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 because of lower average borrowings and interest rates. The second quarter and year to date fiscal 2009 effective tax rates are at 30% and 155%, respectively versus the 23% and 33% used in the same respective periods last year. The effective tax rate fluctuation between the second quarters was due to the difference in dividends. The difference between the year to date rates was due to the resolution of federal tax matters.
Other income in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2008 reflects the gain on the redemption of an investment in preferred stock and the associated dividends.
Other Matters:
On December 1, 2008, a fire destroyed inventory and equipment in a leased warehouse facility in Dyersburg, TN. The destroyed facility supported our lawn and garden manufacturing operations in Newbern, TN where production was temporarily suspended as replacement parts and components were expedited. Production at the Newbern plant has since resumed to normal levels. We believe the property losses incurred are covered under our property insurance policies subject to customary incurred loss deductibles.
Outlook:
The company continues to estimate net income in a range from $40 to $50 million or $0.81 to $1.01 per diluted share for the full year. This range reflects our belief that channel inventories of lawn and garden products are at normal levels after the 2008 season and our projections related to our product placement for fiscal 2009 are still valid. The forecast continues to reflect the uncertainty of the upcoming spring selling season for outdoor power equipment given the current economic conditions. The company also projects that the third quarter's results will lag the comparable period from a year ago because major retailers will control their working capital commitment to the category and be more comfortable with chasing demand this year while they assess the strength of consumer demand during the spring.
The company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EST) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 814-1917. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

Exhibit 99.1
Milwaukee, WI  February 16, 2009/PR Newswire/Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") today announced that Thomas R. Savage, Senior Vice President, Administration, has entered into an individual stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. Savage informed the Company that under his trading plan he intends to sell 19,980 shares of Company common stock that would be issued if certain stock options are exercised before they expire in August 2009. The purpose of the plan is to provide Mr. Savage with the ability to exercise his expiring options and sell the underlying Company common stock in an orderly manner and avoid concerns about the timing of the transactions.
The amount that Mr. Savage may realize from the exercise of any options will be the number of options exercised multiplied by the amount by which the net selling prices of the Company's stock on the dates the stock options are exercised exceed the exercise prices of the stock options.
Other Company executives may from time to time adopt Rule 10b5-1 plans.

On April 16, 2009, Briggs & Stratton Corporation issued a press release announcing fiscal 2009 third quarter results and declaring a reduced quarterly dividend in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
On April 16, 2009, Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced that at its regular quarterly meeting held yesterday, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of eleven cents ($0.11) per share on the common stock of the Corporation. The dividend is payable June 26, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business June 1, 2009. The quarterly dividend has been reduced 50% from the prior quarter's level. This reduced dividend is more comparable with our historical payout ratio of 50% of net income and dividend yield of 3.5%. In addition, a reduced dividend preserves cash in light of the continuing uncertainty in the credit markets. This action, along with other cash preserving initiatives, should reduce our need for additional borrowings for working capital in the near to medium term future.

James E. Brenn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
Briggs & Stratton today announced third quarter fiscal 2009 consolidated net sales of $673.8 million and consolidated net income of $25.4 million or $0.51 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2008 had consolidated net sales of $725.7 million and consolidated net income of $38.9 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales decreased $51.9 million or 7%. The entire decrease was due to lower sales volumes in the Engines Segment. Third quarter consolidated net income decreased $13.5 million between years. Engines Segment operating results and a higher effective tax rate between years were the primary cause of the lower net income.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, consolidated net sales were $1.609 billion and consolidated net income was $26.6 million or $0.54 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1.570 billion, and consolidated net income was $22.1 million or $0.45 per diluted share. The $39.0 million or 2% increase in consolidated net sales was primarily the result of improved sales volume in the Power Products Segment. The nine-month consolidated net income increased by $4.5 million between years. Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 included a $29.0 million after tax gain resulting from the redemption of an investment in preferred stock and the impact of a $19.8 million ($12.7 million after tax) warranty expense for a snow engine recall. Excluding the aforementioned items consolidated net income in fiscal 2009 improved by $20.8 million over the prior year. The improvement is primarily the result of the improved sales and production volumes experienced in the Power Products Segment.
Engines:
Third quarter net sales for fiscal 2009 were $480.2 million versus $546.4 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $66.2 million or 12%. The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of an engine unit shipment decrease of 13% from the same period a year ago. Shipments of engines decreased in the third quarter for lawn and garden applications due to an uncertainty as to the amount of retail demand that will occur this season and the desire by the channel participants to control their working capital commitments.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $1.078 billion versus $1.070 billion in the prior year, an increase of $8.0 million or 1%. Unit volume increases of 16% through the first six months, the result of market share gains and higher engine demand for portable generators, were negated by the soft engine demand discussed for the third quarter.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $46.6 million, down $21.1 million from $67.7 million during the same period in the prior year. The lower income from operations was the result of the negative impact of currency exchange rates, primarily on sales denominated in Euros, lower sales volume and lower utilization of the production facilities.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $63.1 million, up $12.5 million from $50.6 million during the same period a year ago. Income from operations in fiscal 2008 was impacted by the $19.8 million warranty expense associated with the snow engine recall. After giving consideration to the warranty expense, income from operations was lower by $7.3 million between years. The decrease was the result of higher commodity costs, the negative impact of currency exchange rates experienced in the third quarter and lower production volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases were the increased sales volume, the benefit from a plant closure in fiscal 2008, lower expenditures for several operating costs and certain price increases between years.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2009 third quarter net sales were $250.2 million versus $241.7 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $8.5 million. The net sales increase was primarily the result of $8.4 million of sales related to our June 30, 2008 acquisition of Victa Lawncare Pty. Ltd. ("Victa"). Lower shipment volumes in almost every product category in the Segment, except portable generators, offset pricing enhancements implemented to offset commodity cost increases. Similar to the Engines Segment, the lower shipments reflect uncertainty as to the amount of retail demand that will occur this spring and the desire by the channel participants to control their working capital commitments.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $697.7 million versus $624.8 million in the prior year, a $72.9 million increase. Victa sales in this period accounted for $33.6 million of the sales increase. The remaining sales improvement was the result of pricing enhancements implemented to counter commodity cost increases and a net unit volume increase driven by stronger portable generator shipments.
There was a loss from operations of $2.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, an improvement of $6.0 million between years. The improvement resulted primarily from better plant utilization. Pricing enhancements experienced in the third quarter were effectively offset by higher costs to manufacture, primarily the cost of commodities.
The loss from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $8.9 million, an improvement of $27.1 million from the operating loss generated for the same period a year ago. The improvement resulted partially from better plant utilization because of higher production volumes, primarily for portable generator product. Pricing enhancements in several product categories was the other primary contributor to the improvement.
General:
Other income for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 is lower than last year by $37.1 million because last year had a gain from the redemption of preferred stock and their associated dividends. Interest expense was less in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009 due to lower borrowings for working capital and lower average interest rates.
The effective tax rate was 31.4% for the third quarter and 23.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 versus 18.3% and 2.2% for the same periods last year, respectively. The variation reflected between years was due to the required recognition of the tax effects of certain events as discrete items in the quarter that they occur rather than in the overall expected annual tax rate. In addition, the impact of expected tax credits and exclusions as a percentage of annual earnings for fiscal 2008 resulted in a lower effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2008. We expect the effective rate for the full fiscal 2009 to be in the 24.0% to 26.0% range.
Outlook:
The Engines Segment unit volume is projected to soften globally in the fourth quarter, with units potentially being down 5% compared to the previous year. Our annual shipment volume, rather than being greater than last year, is now projected to be similar to slightly down from last year. In addition, the mix of the engine shipments will shift to smaller displacement engines as the forecast for consumer and commercial riding equipment, which use larger displacement engines, has been revised downward. Besides reducing our revenues and gross margins, this sales volume and mix challenge will cause us to contract our production schedules to manage our working capital commitment for inventory at fiscal year end.
The lawn and garden equipment component of the Power Products Segment is also significantly affected by the revised projections, especially those for consumer and commercial riding equipment. We sell the majority of our lawn and garden equipment through dealers that carry premium consumer and commercial riding equipment. In addition to projected lower consumer demand, we can see that dealers and retailers are controlling their working capital levels due to the uncertainty in the U.S. economy. As in the Engines Segment, we are reducing our outlook for operating profit on lower sales and production volumes.
Finally, our forecast now reflects an estimate of a stronger dollar by fiscal year end that will cause a greater loss, especially as it relates to our European sales and operations. All of the aforementioned considerations result in a net income forecast for the year in the range of $23 to $32 million or $0.46 to $0.65 per diluted share for the full year. The range reflects that various industry forecasts now call for the lawn and garden market to be down anywhere from high single to low double digits. Consolidated net sales are projected to be similar to last year, with improved gross margins, lower operating expenses and interest expense of approximately $32 million.
Dividend Declaration:
At its regular quarterly meeting held yesterday, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of eleven cents ($0.11) per share on the common stock of the Corporation. The dividend is payable June 26, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business June 1, 2009. The quarterly dividend has been reduced 50% from the prior quarter's level. This reduced dividend is more comparable with our historical payout ratio of 50% of net income and dividend yield of 3.5%. In addition, a reduced dividend preserves cash in light of the continuing uncertainty in the credit markets. This action, along with other cash preserving initiatives, should reduce our need for additional borrowings for working capital in the near to medium term future.

The Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation accepted the resignation of Mary K. Bush, one of the Corporation's directors, effective upon the conclusion of the Board's quarterly meeting on April 15, 2009. Ms. Bush notified the Corporation on or about February 6, 2009 of her intent to resign as a director.
Ms. Bush became a director of the Corporation in August 2004. She served on the Board's Compensation Committee and Audit Committee at the time of her resignation. Ms. Bush resigned as a director of the Corporation in order to comply with a policy imposed by another public company on whose board she serves that limits the number of directorships its directors are permitted to hold.
 
On April 15, 2009, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation approved amendments to Sections 2.05 and 2.11 of the Corporation's bylaws. Among other things, the amendments clarify that the advance notice process set forth in the bylaws is the exclusive means for a shareholder of the Corporation to propose nominees for election to the Board or to submit other business before an annual or special meeting of shareholders, other than a matter properly brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, the amendments expand the scope of information shareholders must provide when (1) demanding a special meeting of shareholders, (2) nominating a person for election as a director or bringing other business before a meeting of shareholders pursuant to the advance notice provisions or (3) seeking to have shareholders consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting. Shareholders must disclose all ownership interests in the Corporation, any arrangements or relationships with a shareholder-proposed nominee and any interest in a proposal other than board nominations. The amendments to the bylaws were effective immediately upon approval by the Board of Directors.
The foregoing description of the amendments to the bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Corporation's amendments, which are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
Section 2.05 of the Bylaws was amended to read as follows:
(a) The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than ten days and not more than seventy days prior to the date of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the 30th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within thirty days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th day shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. When a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date and except as otherwise required by law. A new Meeting Record Date must be set if a meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for any other purpose. Such record date shall not be more than seventy days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a share dividend or distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation's shares), then the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the Board of Directors is adopted declaring the dividend or distribution shall be the record date.
(c) In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (the "Consent Record Date"). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and such date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the corporation by hand or by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a
 
request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days after the date on which such a request is received by the Secretary, then the Consent Record Date shall be the 10th day after the first date on which a valid written request to set a Consent Record Date is received by the Secretary. To be valid, such written request shall comply with each of the following:
(i) Such written request shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record and by the beneficial owners or owners, if any, on whose behalf the shareholder or shareholders are acting, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth: (A) the name and address, as they appear on this corporation's books, of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner who seeks to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (B) the Share Information (as defined in Section 2.11) relating to each such shareholder and beneficial owner; (C) a representation that each such shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders; (D) any other information relating to such shareholder and any such beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (E) the manner in which each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner intend to comply with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act in seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (F) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) the name and residence address of the person or persons each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director, (2) a description of all agreements, arrangements or understandings between each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect such person as a director, including without limitation any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person as to how each person such shareholder and beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question, (3) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and their respective Affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each person such shareholder and beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director, and his or her respective Affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed

In the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the corporation may require any person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person.
(ii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the corporation's costs relating to such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the corporation's own solicitation, provided that if the Consent Soliciting Shareholder obtains the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents (as defined in Section 7.02(a)) to express the corporate action referred to therein in accordance with these Bylaws, then the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required to pay such costs. For purposes of these Bylaws, "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean each of the following Persons:
(A) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is ten or fewer, each Person signing any such Consents; or
 
(B) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is more than ten, each Person who either (1) was a Participant in any Solicitation of such consent or consents or (2) at the time of the delivery to the corporation of the documents described in this Section 2.05(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies for expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (other than a Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies on behalf of the corporation).
A "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Consent Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in Section 2.05(c)(i) and/or the written agreements described in this Section 2.05(c)(ii) and Section 2.05(c)(iii) to prevent the purposes of this Section 2.05(c) and Section 7.02 from being evaded.
(iii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder agrees to deliver to any inspectors of election engaged by the corporation pursuant to Section 7.02(c) within two (2) Business Days after receipt all Consents and revocations thereof received by such Consent Soliciting Shareholder or such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's proxy solicitor or other designated agent in connection with such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express written consent.
Section 2.11 of the Bylaws was amended to read as follows:
(a) Annual Meetings.
(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an Annual Meeting (A) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any shareholder of the corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this bylaw and who is entitled to vote at the meeting and complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11.

On June 10, 2009, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved reducing the payment of annual base salaries to all company officers by 10%, postponing the payment of cash bonuses to all participants in the company's EVA Incentive Compensation Plan, and discontinuing the company's matching contributions to all participants in its Consolidated Retirement and Savings Plan and Key Employee Savings and Investment Plan.
(e) Modified Compensatory Plan.
The company's officers have consented to the salary reductions and deferral of cash bonuses. All these actions are part of a company-wide program designed to reduce expenses by approximately $5 million in each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2010. The company expects that these actions will assist it in continuing to meet various financial covenants stated in the company's loan agreements in the event that there are no major weather events in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2010 that generate sales demand for portable generators and their related engines. The actions are effective July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, when they will be reevaluated based on the company's financial condition at that time. Such reevaluation may result in continuing the cost reduction actions, terminating them, or returning the salary reductions to officers and other employees.

On July 1, 2009 Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") announced a plan to close its Jefferson and Watertown, Wisconsin manufacturing facilities in fiscal 2010. The Power Products Segment facilities currently manufacture all portable generator, home standby generator and pressure washer products marketed and sold by the company.
The Wisconsin facilities' production will be consolidated into existing United States engine and lawn and garden product facilities to optimize plant utilization and achieve better integration between engine and end product design, manufacturing and distribution.
The decision was communicated to affected employees on July 1, 2009, and it is expected that the closure of the facilities will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges for facility consolidation and closure costs of approximately $10.3 million consisting of $4.6 million of asset impairment costs and $5.7 million of other costs. Cash expenditures related to the closure are estimated to be approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company will recognize a pre-tax $5.8 million charge composed of $4.6 million of asset impairments and approximately $1.2 million of employee related charges for severance and pension costs. The impact of the facilities' consolidation on fiscal 2010 earnings is anticipated to be minimal because the remaining $4.5 million of closure costs are projected to be offset by savings from the consolidation. In fiscal 2011, the Company estimates approximately $11.0 million of pre-tax savings from the consolidation of operations.
A copy of the press release announcing the plan to close the Wisconsin facilities is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
Briggs & Stratton Will Recognize an Impairment Related to a Plant Rationalization in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2009
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced a plan to close its Jefferson, Wisconsin manufacturing facility in fiscal 2010. The Power Products Segment facility currently manufactures all portable generator, home standby generator and pressure washer products marketed and sold by the company.
The Jefferson facility's production will be consolidated into existing United States engine and lawn and garden product facilities to optimize plant utilization and achieve better integration between engine and end product design, manufacturing and distribution.
In conjunction with the closing of the facility, the company will recognize a pre-tax $5.8 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 composed of $4.6 million of net asset impairments and approximately $1.2 million of employee related charges for severance and pension costs. The impact of the facilities' consolidation on fiscal 2010 earnings is projected to be minimal because estimated savings will be offset by closure costs and the fact that the facility will be in operation for a portion of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2011, the company estimates approximately $11.0 million of pre-tax savings from the consolidation of operations.

(e) . On August 11, 2009 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Corporation") modified the Corporation's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation Plan (the "EVA Plan") and Premium Option and Stock Award Program (the "POSA Program"). The modifications are prospective  they do not affect incentive compensation awards made in August 2009 with respect to Plan Year 2009, but they will be effective for awards made for Plan Year 2010 and future years.
Modifications to Compensatory Arrangements
The Committee modified the EVA Plan to establish a new category of participants named "Key Managers". Key Managers are designated annually by the Committee and have target incentive awards set at 40% of their base salary. The Committee modified the EVA Plan to clarify its right to suspend or terminate awards before they are paid to participants. The Committee also added a clawback provision to the EVA Plan that permits recovery of cash bonuses that have been paid to Senior Executives and Key Managers with respect to (1) a Plan Year for which there occurs within the 3 years following the award a material restatement of the Corporation's annual report filed with the SEC due to the negligence or misconduct of one or more persons, and (2) any subsequent Plan Year in which a cash bonus was materially affected by the restatement.
The Committee modified the POSA Program to remove a provision limiting to 500,000 the maximum number of shares of restricted and deferred stock that may be granted to all participants for any Plan Year, and limiting to 730,000 the maximum number of stock options that may be granted to all participants for any Plan Year. This action was taken to provide the Committee with more flexibility in the administration of the POSA Program. Limitations on aggregate awards and limitations on annual equity awards to individuals of 160,000 shares of restricted and deferred stock and 230,000 stock options remain in the shareholder-approved Incentive Compensation Plan. The Committee modified the POSA Program to clarify its right to suspend or terminate awards before they are paid to participants. In addition, the Committee added clawback provisions to the agreements under which restricted stock, deferred stock and stock options will be awarded to Senior Executives and Key Managers.
Amended and restated copies of the EVA Plan and POSA Program are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Copies of the agreements under which restricted stock, deferred stock and stock options will be awarded to Senior Executives and Key Managers will be filed as exhibits to the Corporation's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
Effective 6-29-09
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") shall be responsible for the design, administration, and interpretation of the Plan.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where the Risk Free Rate is the average daily closing yield rate on 10 year U.S. Treasury Bonds for the month of March immediately preceding the relevant Plan Year, the Business Risk Index is determined by using an average of the Beta available in the four (4) most recent Value Line reports on the Company. The Average Equity Risk Premium is 6%, the Debt Yield is the weighted average yield of all borrowing included in the Company's permanent capital, and the tax rate is the combination of the relevant federal and state income tax rates.
 
 
 
 
EVA may be positive or negative.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In no case may the Accrued Bonus exceed three times the Target Incentive Award or be less than negative one times the Target Incentive Award.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A newly hired employee or an employee transferred, promoted, or demoted during the Plan Year to a position qualifying for participation (or leaving the participating class) may accrue (subject to discretion of the Committee) a pro rata Accrued Bonus based on the percentage of the Plan Year (actual weeks/full year times a full year award amount for that position) the employee is in each participating position.
 
An employee discharged during the Plan Year shall not be eligible for an Accrued Bonus, even though his or her service arrangement or contract extends past year-end, unless the Committee determines that the conditions of the termination indicate that a prorated Accrued Bonus is appropriate. The Committee shall have full and final authority in making such a determination.
 
An employee who resigns during the Plan Year to accept employment elsewhere (including self-employment) will not be eligible for an Accrued Bonus.
 
If a Participant's employment is terminated during a Plan Year by reason of death, disability, or normal or early retirement under the Company's retirement plan, a tentative Accrued Bonus will be calculated as if the Participant had remained employed as of the end of the Plan Year. The final Accrued Bonus will be calculated by multiplying the tentative Accrued Bonus by a proration factor. The proration factor will be equal to the number of full weeks of employment during the Plan Year divided by fifty-two. For purposes of this section, the date a participant is deemed to be terminated pursuant to disability shall be the date the employee begins receiving a monthly Long Term Disability Benefit under the Company's Group Insurance Plan.
Each employee may name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Plan is to be paid in case of the employee's death.
Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the employee, shall be in the form prescribed by the Committee, and shall be effective only when filed by the employee in writing with the Committee during his or her lifetime.
In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the employee's death shall be paid to the employee's estate.
 
An employee whose status as an active employee is changed during a Plan Year as a result of a leave of absence may, at the discretion of the Committee, be eligible for a pro rata Accrued Bonus determined in the same way as in paragraph D. of this Section.
 
All or a portion of the Accrued Bonus will be either paid to the Participant or credited to or charged against the Bonus Bank as provided in this Article.
 
 
 
 
The Total Bonus Payout for each Plan Year, less amounts required by law to be withheld for income tax and employment tax purposes, shall be paid during the 60 day period following the end of the Plan Year in which it was earned.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank Payout is subtracted from the Bank Balance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
As Amended and Restated
Effective 6-29-09
 
The Premium Option and Stock Award Program ("POSA Program") is designed to build upon the Company's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation Plan ("EVA Plan") by tying the interests of all Senior Executives to the long term consolidated results of the Company. In this way, the objectives of Senior Executives throughout the Company will be more closely aligned with the Company's Shareholders. Whereas the EVA Plan provides for near and intermediate term rewards, the POSA Program provides a longer term focus by allowing Senior Executives to participate in the long-term appreciation in the equity value of the Company. In general, the POSA Program is structured such that each year an amount equivalent to the Total Bonus Payout under the EVA Plan is invested on behalf of Senior Executives in restricted and/or deferred shares of the Company's Stock ("Restricted and/or Deferred Stock") and an amount equivalent to the Senior Executive's Target Incentive Award is invested in premium options on the Company's Stock ("PSOs"). The shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock vest five years after their date of grant. The PSOs vest and become exercisable after they have been held for three years, and they expire at the end of five years. The PSOs are structured so that a fair return must be provided to the Company's Shareholders before they become valuable.
 
For each Plan Year, the dollar amount to be invested in Restricted and/or Deferred Stock for each Senior Executive shall be equal to the amount of each Participant's Total Bonus Payout determined under the EVA Plan. The number of shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock awarded shall be determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount of such Restricted and/or Deferred Stock award by (b) the Fair Market Value of Company Stock on the date of grant as determined by the Committee, rounded (up or down) to the nearest 10 shares. Fair Market Value is defined in the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan ("ICP").
The Compensation Committee shall determine whether stock awards shall consist of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock or a mix of each type of stock, and may consider each Senior Executive's preference in making such determination. All shares of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant regardless of whether such vesting date occurs before or after retirement and shall have such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
 
For each Plan Year, the dollar amount to be invested in PSOs for each Senior Executive shall be equal to the amount of each Participant's Target Incentive Award determined under the EVA Plan. The number of PSOs awarded shall be determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount of such PSO award by (b) the Black-Scholes value of a share of Company stock based on its Fair Market Value on the date of the grant as determined by the Committee, rounded (up or down) to the nearest 10 shares. Fair Market Value is defined in the ICP.
 
All PSOs shall vest and be exercisable beginning on the third anniversary of the date of grant and shall terminate on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant unless sooner exercised, unless the Committee determines other dates.
The exercise price for PSOs shall be 110% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Company's Stock on the date of grant.
 
The Committee shall have the right to modify or amend the POSA Program from time to time, or suspend it or terminate it entirely. The Committee may suspend or terminate an award of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock or PSOs for a Plan Year at any time prior to its delivery to the Senior Executive.
 
Except as modified herein, PSOs are Incentive Stock Options under the Company's ICP as amended from time to time to the extent they are eligible for treatment as such under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. If not eligible for ISO treatment, the PSOs shall constitute nonqualified stock options. Except as specifically modified herein, PSOs shall be governed by the terms of the Company's ICP, and shall be granted as described in this Program annually unless the Committee modifies or terminates either the EVA Plan or the ICP. As provided in the ICP, all grants of PSOs to Participants who are subject to Sec. 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are subject to approval of the Company Shareholders. In the event such approval is not obtained, this Program shall terminate.
 
All capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning given to them in the Company's EVA Plan and ICP.

On August 12, 2009, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") approved amendments to the Company's existing Rights Agreement between the Company and National City Bank, as Rights Agent, dated as of August 7, 1996, as previously amended by an amendment dated as of November 25, 2002 and an amendment dated as of August 9, 2006 (the "Rights Agreement").
The material amendments to the Rights Agreement that the Board approved on August 12, 2009 (i) modified the definition of "Beneficial Owner" and "beneficial ownership" of Common Shares of the Company to include in a person's beneficial ownership, among other things, Common Shares of the Company beneficially owned by a counterparty under certain derivatives contracts to which such person is a party; (ii) reduced the redemption price for the Common Share Purchase Rights ("Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement to $.001 per Right; and (iii) extended the term of the Rights Agreement by changing the scheduled expiration date from October 18, 2009 to October 17, 2012. As a consequence of the modification described in clause (i), the Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person that become null and void include Rights associated with Common Shares of the Company beneficially owned by a counterparty under certain derivatives contracts, if any, to which the Acquiring Person is a party. The Rights Agreement defines an "Acquiring Person" as any person who, together with its affiliates and associates, shall be the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company, subject to certain exceptions.
The Rights Agreement, as amended through August 12, 2009, is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1. The foregoing description of the Rights Agreement and changes to the terms of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 4.1.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: August 17, 2009
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 4.1
 
 
 
Agreement, dated as of August 7, 1996, as amended through August 12, 2009, between Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), and National City Bank (the "Rights Agent").
The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized and declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each Common Share (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding on August 19, 1996 (the "Record Date") payable on such date, each Right representing the right to purchase one-half of one Common Share, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized and directed the issuance of one Right with respect to each Common Share that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined). The amendments to this Agreement adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on August 12, 2009 are effective as of the close of business on August 12, 2009 (the "2009 Amendment Effective Time").
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Section 1. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
(a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates (as such terms are hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Person who or which, at the close of business on August 7, 1996, shall have been the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding shall be deemed an "Acquiring Person"; provided, however, that, if a Person is, at the close of business on the date hereof, the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding and shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of additional Common Shares of the Company at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person"; (ii) no Person who (A) does not qualify as an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Agreement prior to the 2009 Amendment Effective Time) immediately prior to the 2009 Amendment Effective Time and (B) at the 2009 Amendment Effective Time shall be the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding as a result of the amendment of the definition of "Beneficial Owner" and "beneficial ownership" shall be deemed an "Acquiring
Person"; provided, however, that, if such Person shall after the 2009 Amendment Effective Time become the Beneficial Owner of additional Common Shares of the Company at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person"; and (iii) no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as a result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; provided, however, that if a Person would, but for the provisions of this clause (iii), become an Acquiring Person by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person", as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), has become such inadvertently, and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement; provided that any such Person shall cease to qualify for the exclusion from the definition of "Acquiring Person" contained in this paragraph from and after such time (if any) as the Person shall subsequently become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares at any time that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding (other than Common Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person), unless the Person independently meets the conditions set forth in this paragraph with respect to the circumstances relating to the Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
(b) "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
(c) A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any securities:
(i) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly;
 
(ii) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has (A) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, rights (other than these Rights), warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any security if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report);
(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person with which such Person referred to in the introductory clause of this Section 1(c) or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities) for the purpose of, or with respect to, acquiring, holding, voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to Section 1(c)(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of the Company;
(iv) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, has or shares the right to vote or dispose of, or has "beneficial ownership" (as defined under Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of, including pursuant to any agreement arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing; or
(v) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a Counterparty under any Derivatives Contract (without regard to any short or similar position under the same or any other Derivatives Contract) to which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates is a Receiving Party; provided that the number of Common Shares that a Person is deemed to beneficially own pursuant to this Section 1(c)(v) in connection with a particular Derivatives Contract shall not exceed the number of Notional Common Shares that are subject to such Derivatives Contract; provided, further, that the number of securities beneficially owned by each Counterparty ("Counterparty A") under a Derivatives Contract shall for purposes of this Section 1(c)(v) be deemed to include all securities that are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a Counterparty ("Counterparty B") under any Derivatives Contract to which such Counterparty A is a Receiving Party, this proviso being applied to successive Counterparties as appropriate.
 
A "Derivatives Contract" means a contract between two parties (the "Receiving Party" and the "Counterparty") that is designed to produce the economic benefits and risks to the Receiving Party that correspond substantially to the ownership by the Receiving Party of a number of Common Shares (the number corresponding to such economic benefits and risks, the "Notional Common Shares"), regardless of whether obligations under such contract are settled through the delivery of cash, Common Shares or other property, without regard to any short position under the same or any other Derivative Contract. Notwithstanding anything in this definition of Beneficial Ownership to the contrary, the phrase "then outstanding," when used with reference to a Person's Beneficial Ownership of securities of the Company, shall mean the number of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of such securities not then actually issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to own beneficially hereunder.
(d) "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or a day on which the New York Stock Exchange or banking institutions in Wisconsin are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
(e) "Close of business" on any given date shall mean 5:00 P.M., Milwaukee, Wisconsin time, on such date; provided, however, that if such date is not a Business Day it shall mean 5:00 P.M., Milwaukee, Wisconsin time, on the next succeeding Business Day.
(f) "Common Shares" shall mean the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, except that "Common Shares" when used with reference to any Person other than the Company shall mean the capital stock (or equity interest) with the greatest voting power of such other Person or, if such other Person is a Subsidiary of another Person, the Person or Persons which ultimately control such first-mentioned Person.
(g) "Distribution Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3 hereof.
(h) "Final Expiration Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 7 hereof.
(i) "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or other entity, and shall include any successor (by merger or otherwise) of such entity.
(j) "Qualified Offer" shall mean an offer that has, to the extent required for the type of offer specified, each of the following characteristics:
(i) a fully financed all-cash tender offer or an exchange offer offering at least 70 percent cash and Common Shares of the offeror (with the amount of such Common Shares to be adjusted to reflect any decrease in the value of such shares prior to the consummation of the offer), in each such case for any and all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company;
 
(ii) an offer that has commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act;
(iii) an offer whose per-share offer price (A) is greater than the highest reported market price for the Common Shares of the Company during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act and (B) represents a reasonable premium above the average of the closing prices (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the offer is commenced, with, in the case of an offer that includes shares of Common Shares of the offeror, such per-share offer price being determined using the lower of (1) the lowest reported market price for Common Shares of the offeror during the five trading days immediately preceding and the five trading days immediately following the commencement of such offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act and (2) the average of the last sale prices (regular way) of such shares reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to such shares for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of any determination;
(iv) an offer that (A) is accompanied by a written opinion, in customary form, of a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is addressed to the Company and the holders of Common Shares of the Company other than such Person and states that the price to be paid to such holders pursuant to the offer is fair from a financial point of view to such holders and includes any written presentation of such firm showing the analysis and range of values underlying such conclusions, which written opinion and any such presentation are updated and provided to the Company within two Business Days prior to the date such offer is consummated, and (B) within 20 Business Days after the commencement date of the offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or within 10 Business Days after any increase in the offer consideration), does not result in a nationally recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company rendering an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares is either unfair or inadequate;
(v) if the offer includes Common Shares of the offeror, an offer pursuant to which (A) the offeror shall permit a nationally recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company and legal counsel designated by the Company to have access to such offeror's books, records, management, accountants and other appropriate outside advisers for the purposes of permitting such investment banking firm and such legal counsel to conduct a due diligence review of the offeror in order to permit such investment banking firm (relying as appropriate on the advice of such legal counsel) to be able to render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to whether the
 
consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company is fair or adequate, and (B) within 10 Business Days after such investment banking firm shall have notified the Company and the offeror that it had completed the due diligence review to its satisfaction (or following completion of such due diligence review within 10 Business Days after any increase in the consideration being offered), such investment banking firm does not render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company is either unfair or inadequate and such investment banking firm does not after the expiration of such 10 Business Day period render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered to the holders of the Common Shares of the Company has become either unfair or inadequate based on a subsequent disclosure or discovery of a development or developments that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on the value of the Common Shares of the offeror;
(vi) an offer that is subject only to the minimum tender condition described below in item (ix) of this definition and other usual and customary terms and conditions, which conditions shall not include any financing, funding or similar condition or any requirements with respect to the offeror or its agents being permitted any due diligence with respect to the books, records, management, accountants and other outside advisers of the Company;

(viii) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror that, in addition to the minimum time periods specified in item (vii) of this definition, the offer, if it is otherwise to expire prior thereto, will be extended for at least 20 Business Days after any increase in the price offered, and after any bona fide alternative offer is commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Exchange Act;
 
(ix) an offer that is conditioned on a minimum of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) being tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer's expiration date, which condition shall not be waivable;

(xiii) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that the offeror will pay (or share with any other offeror) at least one-half of the Company's costs of a Special Meeting requested in accordance with Section 23(c) with respect to such offer; and
 
(xiv) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that, if the offer is not consummated, neither the offeror nor any of its Affiliates or Associates will make any offer for or purchase any equity securities of the Company for a period of one year after the commencement within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act of the original offer if such original offer does not result in the tender of at least 85% of the outstanding Common Shares not owned by such offeror (including its Affiliates and Associates), unless another tender offer by another party for all outstanding Common Shares of the Company is commenced that (A) constitutes a Qualified Offer (in which event, any new offer by such offeror or of any of its Affiliates or Associates must be at a price no less than that provided for in such original offer) or (B) is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (in which event, any new offer by such offeror or of any of its Affiliates or Associates must be at a price no less than that provided for in such approved offer).
For the purposes of the definition of Qualified Offer, "fully financed" shall mean that the offeror has sufficient funds for the offer which shall be evidenced by (A) definitive financing agreements executed between the offeror and responsible financial institutions having the necessary financial capacity to provide funds for such offer subject only to customary terms and conditions (which shall in no event include conditions requiring access by such financial institutions to non-public information to be provided by the Company, conditions based on the accuracy of any information concerning the Company, or conditions requiring the Company to make any representations, warranties or covenants in connection with such financing), (B) cash or cash equivalents then available to the offeror, set apart and maintained solely for the purpose of funding the offer with an irrevocable written commitment being provided by the offeror to the Company to maintain such availability until the offer is consummated or withdrawn, or (C) a combination of the foregoing; which evidence (including certified copies of any such definitive financing agreements (including exhibits and related documents) and copies of all written materials prepared by the offeror for such financial institutions in connection with entering into such financing agreements) has been provided to the Company prior to, or upon, commencement of the offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act; provided that "sufficient funds for the offer" shall be an amount sufficient to pay for all Common Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis the cash portion of the consideration pursuant to the offer and the second-step transaction required by clause (x) above and all related expenses. If an offer becomes a Qualified Offer in accordance with this definition but subsequently ceases to be a Qualified Offer as a result of the failure at a later date to continue to satisfy any of the requirements of this definition, such offer shall cease to be a Qualified Offer and the provisions of Section 23(c) shall no longer be applicable to such offer, provided the actual redemption of the Rights pursuant to Section 23(c) shall not have already occurred.

Section 2. Appointment of Rights Agent. The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company may from time to time appoint such co-rights agents as it may deem necessary or desirable, and will promptly notify the Rights Agent of any such appointment. Any actions that may be taken by the Rights Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement may also be taken by any such co-rights agent. To the extent that any co-rights agent takes any action pursuant to this Agreement, such co-rights agent will be entitled to all of the rights and protections of, and subject to all of the applicable duties and obligations imposed upon, the Rights Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Rights Agent will have no duty to supervise, and in no event shall be liable for, the acts or omissions of any co-rights agent.
Section 3. Issue of Right Certificates.
(a) Until the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of Common Shares of the Company aggregating 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (including any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights; the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"), (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the right to receive Right Certificates will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares; provided that if a tender or exchange offer is terminated prior to the occurrence of a Distribution Date, then no Distribution Date shall occur as a result of such tender or exchange offer. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign (either manually or by facsimile signature), and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of
 
Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (a "Right Certificate"), evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held. As of the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
(b) On the Record Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Common Shares, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof. Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.
(c) Certificates for Common Shares which become outstanding (including, without limitation, certificates for reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph (c) and certificates issued on the transfer of Common Shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Briggs & Stratton Corporation and National City Bank, dated as of August 7, 1996, and as such agreement may be amended (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. Briggs & Stratton Corporation will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. As described in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued to any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall become null and void.
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated
 
with such Common Shares shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.
Section 4. Form of Right Certificates. The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase Common Shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit A hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Section 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of Common Shares as shall be set forth therein at the price per Common Share set forth therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the amount and type of securities purchasable upon exercise of each Right and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.
Section 5. Countersignature and Registration.
(a) The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, any of its Vice Presidents, or its Treasurer, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be countersigned by the Rights Agent, either manually or by facsimile signature, and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the individual who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company. Any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such individual was not such an officer.
(b) Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.
 
Section 6. Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, at any time after the close of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of Common Shares as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the principal office of the Rights Agent. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
(b) Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
Section 7. Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights.
(a) The registered holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the principal office of the Rights Agent, together with payment of the Purchase Price for each Common Share as to which the Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the close of business on October 17, 2012 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption Date"), or (iii) the time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof.
(b) The Purchase Price for each Common Share purchasable pursuant to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $160, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof (including an adjustment of such price to $80 as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Common Shares effected as a 100% stock dividend effective October 29, 2004) and shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) below.
 
(c) Upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof, as set forth below, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) requisition from any transfer agent of the Common Shares certificates for the number of Common Shares to be purchased and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate. The payment of the Purchase Price (as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof) shall be made in cash or by certified check, cashier's check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company, except that, if so provided by the Board of Directors of the Company, the payment of the Purchase Price following the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (as hereinafter defined) and until the first occurrence of an event described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of Section 13 (a "Section 13 Event") may be made wholly or in part by delivery of a certificate or certificates (with appropriate stock powers executed in blank attached thereto) evidencing a number of Common Shares of the Company equal to the then Purchase Price divided by the closing price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per Common Share on the Trading Day (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately preceding the date of such exercise. If the Company is obligated to issue other securities of the Company, pay cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities, cash and/or other property are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.
(d) In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to take any action with respect to a registered holder of a Right Certificate upon the occurrence of any purported transfer, assignment or exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate following the form of assignment or election to purchase set forth on the reverse of the Right Certificate surrendered for such transfer, assignment or exercise, and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.
 
(f) Prior to the time and date that an Acquiring Person becomes such, nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Company from issuing previously authorized and unissued Common Shares for any purpose or purposes approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to any applicable law and any rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are then listed.
Section 8. Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates. All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.
Section 9. Reservation and Availability of Common Shares.
(a) The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares or any authorized and issued Common Shares held in its treasury, the number of Common Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights in accordance with Section 7.
(b) So long as the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be listed on any national securities exchange, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all Common Shares reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
(c) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Common Shares delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such Common Shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares (except as otherwise provided by any corporation law applicable to the Company).
(d) The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any Common Shares upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates for the Common Shares in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver any certificates for Common Shares upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall
 
have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
(e) If the Company determines that registration under the Securities Act is required, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to file, as soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights, (ii) to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the Expiration Date. The Company shall also take such action as may be appropriate to ensure compliance with the securities or blue sky laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed 90 days, the exercisability of the Rights to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective or to qualify the rights, the exercise thereof or the issuance of securities upon the exercise thereof under state securities or blue sky laws. The Company shall issue a public announcement upon any such suspension stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement when the suspension is no longer in effect. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable for securities in any jurisdiction if the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction has not been obtained, such exercise is not permitted under applicable law or a registration statement in respect of such securities has not been declared effective.
Section 10. Common Shares Record Date. Each Person in whose name any certificate for Common Shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Common Shares transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Common Shares transfer books of the Company are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.
Section 11. Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number of Shares or Number of Rights. The Purchase Price, the number of Common Shares covered by each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
 
(a) (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of Common Shares, or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Common Shares transfer books of the Company were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
(ii) Subject to the following paragraph and Section 24 of this Agreement, in the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person (a "Section 11(a)(ii) Event"), each holder of a Right shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to two times the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of Common Shares of the Company as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying two times the then current Purchase Price by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (y) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Company's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of the occurrence of such event (such number of shares, the "Adjustment Shares"). In the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person and the Rights shall then be outstanding, the Company shall not, except as permitted by Section 24 or Section 27, take any action which would eliminate or diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
From and after such time as a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person (or any Associate or Affiliate of such Acquiring Person) shall be void and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. No Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or 6 that represents Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof; no Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to
 
the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate; and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be cancelled. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this paragraph are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.
(iii) In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares of the Company issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and not reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon exercise of the Rights) to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Company shall: (A) determine the excess of (1) the value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Right (the "Current Value") over (2) the Purchase Price (such excess, the "Spread"), and (B) with respect to each Right, make adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares, upon payment of the applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in the Purchase Price, (3) equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares, or units of shares, of preferred stock which the Board of Directors of the Company has deemed to have the same value as Common Shares (such shares of preferred stock, hereinafter referred to as "common stock equivalents")), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having an aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company based upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, however, if the Company shall not have made adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (the "Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, Common Shares (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional Common Shares might be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek shareholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such period, as it may be extended, the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to the last paragraph of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period to seek any authorization of additional shares
 
and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the Common Shares shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Common Shares on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date and the value of any "common stock equivalent" shall be deemed to have the same value as the Common Shares on such date.
(b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or securities convertible into Common Shares at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Common Shares) less than the then current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Common Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Common Shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market price and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Common Shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Common Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Common Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such
 
record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Common Share and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Common Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(d) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Common Shares or any other security (a Common Share or other security, a "Security" for the purpose of this Section 11(d)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each Trading Day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System ("Nasdaq") or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day. If the Security is not publicly held or so listed or traded, then "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
 
(e) No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the date of the expiration of the right to exercise any Rights.
(f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than Common Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Shares contained in this Section 11 and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Common Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
(g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of Common Shares purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
(h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of Common Shares (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of shares covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
(i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of Common Shares for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after
 
adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of Common Shares which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable (except as otherwise provided by any corporation law applicable to the Company) Common Shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the Common Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Common Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
(m) Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Common Shares, issuance wholly
 
for cash of any Common Shares at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Common Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares, dividends on Common Shares payable in Common Shares or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Common Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(n) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Shares Acquisition Date, (i) consolidate with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof), (ii) merge with or into any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof), (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of which complies with the second sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or (iv) consummate a share exchange with any other Person, if at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale or share exchange (A) there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (B) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale or share exchange the stockholders of the Person who constitute, or would constitute, the issuer of Common Shares for purposes of Section 13 hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates or (C) the form or nature of organization of the Principal Party would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights.
Section 12. Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of Shares. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 or 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof.
Section 13. Consolidation, Merger, Share Exchange or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power. In the event, directly or indirectly, at any time after a person has become an Acquiring Person, (a) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person, (b) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger, or any Person or Persons shall consummate a share exchange with the Company, and, in connection with such merger or share exchange, all or part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person (or the Company) or cash or any other property, or (c) the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any
 
other Person other than the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that (i) each holder of a Right (except as otherwise provided herein) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to two times the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of Common Shares of such other Person (including the Company as successor thereto or as the surviving corporation) as shall equal the result obtained by (A) multiplying two times the then current Purchase Price by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Common Shares of such other Person (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale or transfer; (ii) the issuer of such Common Shares shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such issuer; and (iv) such issuer shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights. The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale or transfer unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement so providing. The Company shall not enter into any transaction of the kind referred to in this Section 13 if at the time of such transaction there are any rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which, as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or sales or other transfers.
Section 14. Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.
(a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by
 
Nasdaq or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.
(b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of fractional Common Shares, the Company may, at its sole option, pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Common Share. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
(c) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).
Section 15. Rights of Action. All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Sections 18 and 20 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to, this Agreement.
Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders. Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:
(a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares;
(b) after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal office of the Rights Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and
 
(c) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 17. Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Shareholder. No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Common Shares or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent.
(a) The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, damage, judgment, fine, penalty, claim, demand, cost or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), for anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement and the performance of its duties and responsibilities and the exercise of its rights hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly. The costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification will also be paid by the Company.
(b) The Rights Agent may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of, any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of this Agreement and the performance of its duties and responsibilities and the exercise of its rights hereunder, in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate for the Common Shares or for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons, or otherwise upon the advice or opinion of counsel as set forth in Section 20 hereof.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Rights Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(d) The provisions of this Section 18 shall survive the exercise, exchange, redemption or expiration of the Rights, the termination of this Agreement and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent.
Section 19. Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent.
(a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided, that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
(b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
Section 20. Duties of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes to perform only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent) only upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
(a) Before the Rights Agent acts or refrains from acting, the Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.
 
(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable court of competent jurisdiction).
(d) The Rights Agent shall not be responsible or liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Section 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after actual notice that such change or adjustment is required); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Common Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any Common Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions.
(h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in, or act as the transfer agent for, any of the Rights, Common Shares or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the selection and continued employment thereof (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(k) The provisions of this Section 20 shall survive the exercise, exchange, redemption or expiration of the Rights, the termination of this Agreement and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent.
Section 21. Change of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of the date of such notice as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be,
 
and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of the date of such notice as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a legal business entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any state of the United States so long as such entity is authorized to do business in the State of New York or the State of Wisconsin, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million, or (b) an Affiliate of a legal business entity described in clause (a) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Shares, and, if separate Right Certificates have been issued as of such effective date as contemplated by Section 3 hereof, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 22. Issuance of New Right Certificates. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (a) will, with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities (other than Rights) issued prior to the Distribution Date that are exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the Board, issue Right Certificates representing an equivalent number of Rights as would have been issued in respect of such Common Shares if they had been issued or sold prior to the Distribution Date, as appropriately adjusted as provided herein as if they had been so issued or sold; provided, however, that (i) no such Right Certificate will be issued if, and to the extent that, in its good faith judgment the Board determines that the issuance of such Right Certificate could have a material adverse tax consequence to the Company or to the Person to whom or which such Right Certificate otherwise would be issued and (ii) no such Right Certificate will be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment otherwise has been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.
 
Section 23. Redemption.
(a) The Rights may be redeemed by action of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 or by shareholder action pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this Section 23 and shall not be redeemed in any other manner.
(b) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
(c) If the Company, not earlier than 60 Business Days nor later than 80 Business Days following the commencement of a Qualified Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act, which has not been terminated prior thereto and which continues to be a Qualified Offer, receives a written notice complying with the terms of this Section 23(c) (the "Special Meeting Notice") that is properly executed by the holders of record (or their duly authorized proxy) of at least ten percent (10%) of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) directing the Board of Directors of the Company to submit to a vote of shareholders at a special meeting of the shareholders of the Company (a "Special Meeting") a resolution authorizing the redemption of all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price (the "Redemption Resolution"), then the Board of Directors of the Company shall take such actions as are necessary or desirable to cause the Redemption Resolution to be so submitted to a vote of shareholders by including a proposal relating to adoption of the Redemption Resolution in the proxy materials of the Company for the Special Meeting; provided, however, that in any 12-month period the Company shall not be required to submit more than one Redemption Resolution to a vote of shareholders with respect to Qualified Offers from any given potential Acquiring Person (including any Affiliates or Associates). For purposes of a Special Meeting Notice, the record date for determining eligible holders of record shall be the 60th Business Day following the commencement of a Qualified Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act. Any Special Meeting Notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company and must set forth as to the shareholders of record executing the request (i) the name and address of such shareholders, as they appear on the Company's books and records, (ii) the class and number of Common Shares of the Company that are owned of record by each of such shareholders, and (iii) in the case of Common Shares owned beneficially by another Person, an executed certification by the holder of record that such holder has executed such Special Meeting Notice only after obtaining instructions to do so from such beneficial owner. The Board of Directors shall set a date for
 
determining the shareholders of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting in accordance with the Company's Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and applicable law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company may take a position in favor of or opposed to the adoption of the Redemption Resolution, or no position with respect to the Redemption Resolution, as it determines to be appropriate in the exercise of its duties. At the offeror's request, the Company shall include in any proxy soliciting material prepared by it in connection with the Special Meeting proxy soliciting material submitted by the offeror; provided, however, that the offeror, by written agreement with the Company contained in or delivered with such request, shall have indemnified the Company against any and all liabilities resulting from any statements found to be defamatory, misstatements, misleading statements or omissions contained in or omitted from the offeror's proxy soliciting materials and have agreed to pay the Company's incremental costs incurred as a result of including such material in the Company's proxy soliciting material. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best interests of shareholders to seek an alternative transaction so as to obtain greater value for shareholders than that provided by any Qualified Offer, the Company shall be entitled to include information relating to such alternative transaction in the proxy soliciting material prepared by it in connection with the Special Meeting. If no Person has become an Acquiring Person prior to the redemption date referred to in this Section 23(c), and the Qualified Offer continues to be a Qualified Offer and either (A) the Special Meeting is not held on or prior to the 90th Business Day following receipt of the Special Meeting Notice, or (B) at the Special Meeting, the holders of at least a majority of the Common Shares outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date for the Special Meeting, not giving effect to any affirmative votes cast by the offeror or any of its Affiliates or Associates, shall vote in favor of the Redemption Resolution (and the results of the vote are certified as official by the appointed inspectors of election for the Special Meeting), then all of the Rights shall be deemed redeemed by such failure to hold the Special Meeting or as a result of such shareholder action, as the case may be, at the Redemption Price, or the Board of Directors shall take such other action as would prevent the existence of the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer, effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Qualified Offer, if, and only if, the Qualified Offer is consummated within 60 days after either (x) the close of business on the 90th Business Day following receipt of the Special Meeting Notice if a Special Meeting is not held on or prior to such date or (y) the date on which the results of the vote on the Redemption Resolution at the Special Meeting are certified as official by the appointed inspectors of election for the Special Meeting, as the case may be. Nothing in this subparagraph (c) shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting the Company or any offeror from proposing or engaging in any acquisition, disposition or other transfer of any securities of the Company, any merger or consolidation involving the Company, any sale or other transfer of assets of the Company, any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, or any other business combination or other transaction, or any other action by the Company or such offeror; provided, however, that the holders of Rights shall have the rights set forth in this Rights Agreement with respect to any such acquisition, disposition, transfer, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, business combination, transaction or action.
 
(d) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 or the effectiveness of such redemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 23 (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23 states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.
Section 24. Exchange.
(a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares of the Company at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding. The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective as such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Prior to effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Board of Directors may direct the Company to enter into a trust agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board of Directors shall approve (the "Trust Agreement"). If the Board of Directors so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement
 
and shall issue to the trust created by the Trust Agreement (the "Trust") all of the Common Shares or common stock equivalents, to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 24(c), issuable pursuant to the exchange (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares), and all Persons entitled to receive shares pursuant to the exchange shall be entitled to receive such Common Shares or common stock equivalents (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited in the Trust and any cash in lieu of fractional shares) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
(c) In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights.
(d) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company may, at its sole option, pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), the current market value of a whole Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24.
Section 25. Notice of Certain Events.
(a) In case the Company shall propose, after the Distribution Date, (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Common Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Common Shares (other than a regular
 
quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Common Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Common Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Common Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Common Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with, to effect any share exchange with or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person, (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Common Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.
(b) In case a Section 11(a)(ii) Event or Section 13 Event shall occur, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13 hereof, as applicable.

Exhibit B
On August 6, 1996, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend was paid on August 19, 1996 (the "Record Date") to the shareholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one-half of one Common Share of the Company at a price (the "Purchase Price") of $80 per full share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and National City Bank, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent") dated as of August 7, 1996, as amended through August 12, 2009 and as may thereafter be amended. Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 days following public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (other than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an employee benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary) (an "Acquiring Person") have acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group (other than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an employee benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary) of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Share certificate.
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), (i) the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares; (ii) new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference; and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on October 17, 2012 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company (including by shareholder action in connection with a "Qualified Offer" as defined in the Agreement), in each case, as described below.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Common Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision,
combination or reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Common Shares with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Common Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
In the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current Purchase Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the then current Purchase Price. In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise at the then current Purchase Price that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
At any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right (subject to adjustment).
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. The Company is not required to issue any fractional Common Shares and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash may be made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
At any time prior to the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.001 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. In addition, if the Company receives a Qualified Offer (as defined in the Agreement), then the Rights may be redeemed by way of shareholder action taken at a special meeting of shareholders called by the Board upon the written notice of the holders of at least 10% of Common Shares then outstanding (other than Common Shares held by the offeror or its Affiliates and Associates) for the purpose of voting on a resolution authorizing the redemption of the Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement. The written notice must be received by the Company not earlier than 60 nor later than 80 business days following the commencement of a Qualified Offer that has not been terminated prior thereto and that continues to be a Qualified Offer. The special meeting must be held on or prior to the 90th business day following Company's receipt of such notice. Such an action by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all
 
Common Shares entitled to vote on such issue (excluding Common Shares held by the offeror and its Affiliates or Associates). If either (A) the special meeting is not held on or prior to the 90th business day following receipt of the special meeting notice, or (B) at the special meeting, the requisite holders of Common Shares vote in favor of the redemption resolution, then all of the Rights will be deemed redeemed by such failure to hold the special meeting or as a result of such shareholder action, as the case may be, at the Redemption Price, or the Board of Directors shall take such other action as would prevent the existence of the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer, effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Qualified Offer if, and only if, the Qualified Offer is consummated within 60 days after either (x) the close of business on the 90th business day following receipt of the special meeting notice if a special meeting is not held on or prior to such date or (y) the date on which the results of the vote on the redemption resolution at the special meeting are certified as official, as the case may be. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
"Qualified Offer" means an offer that has each of the following characteristics:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights except that from and after such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

In connection with John S. Shiely's planned retirement as Chief Executive Officer, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Early Retirement Agreement (the "Agreement") with Mr. Shiely on August 21, 2009. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Shiely will retire as an employee and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a director and Chairman of the Board of Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC effective December 31, 2009, and Mr. Shiely will continue to be a participant in the Company's incentive compensation plans until such retirement. At that time, the standard employment agreement and standard change in control agreement between Mr. Shiely and the Company will terminate, except that the non-disclosure, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions will continue in accordance with their respective terms.
After Mr. Shiely's retirement, the provisions of the incentive plans governing employees who qualify for early retirement will govern the awards to Mr. Shiely under the plans and (a) any outstanding stock options awarded to Mr. Shiely but not yet exercisable will immediately become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in the award agreements, (b) any outstanding deferred stock awarded to Mr. Shiely will continue to be subject to the vesting requirements and other terms and conditions stated in the award agreements (but in no event later than the fifth anniversary of grant date), and (c) Mr. Shiely's eligibility for cash and stock awards with respect to the 2009 and 2010 plan years will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Company's incentive compensation plans and in a manner consistent with the treatment of other executive officers.
Because of limitations on the amount of stock options that may be awarded annually under the Company's stock option program, Mr. Shiely will have a carryover of $420,226 at the time of his retirement. Under the Agreement, Mr. Shiely will receive a stock option award in 2010 equivalent in value to the amount of the carryover. Consistent with the treatment of Mr. Shiely's other stock options, the options will vest immediately and remain exercisable until the third anniversary of the grant date.
The Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Shiely for re-election as a director of the Company at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. If Mr. Shiely is re-elected as a director at the 2009 annual meeting, the Agreement provides that he will continue to serve as director and Chairman of the Board until conclusion of the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, at which time his retirement from these positions shall become effective.
The Agreement also provides that as consideration for his commitment to serve as a director and Chairman of the Board following his retirement as an employee and Chief Executive Officer, the Company will provide Mr. Shiely with certain compensation and benefits, including the same compensation provided to other non-employee directors pro-rated for his period of service as a director, a monthly cash fee of $4,166.67 for his period of service as non-employee Chairman of the Board, continued eligibility for the same medical, dental and vision care benefits provided to employees of the Company and their spouses until
 
Mr. Shiely reaches the age of 65 and his spouse reaches the age of 65 (provided that Mr. Shiely pays the actuarial-determined cost for such coverage), and office space for the period from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012 (including part-time services of an administrative assistant and telecommunications service) in order to provide consultation to the Company as needed.
The Agreement does not reduce or affect the eligibility of Mr. Shiely or his family or the amount of compensation and benefits to which Mr. Shiely or his family may be entitled under any qualified and non-qualified retirement and welfare benefit plans or programs of the Company during his employment by the Company or because of his early retirement.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
THIS EARLY RETIREMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into on August 21, 2009 by and between John S. Shiely ("Executive") and Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Corporation").
Executive has notified the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") that he intends to retire from the Corporation's employ as of December 31, 2009 ("Early Retirement"). On that date, Executive will qualify for early retirement treatment under the Corporation's qualified pension plan and the Corporation's non-qualified retirement, equity and benefit plans given that he will be older than age 55 and have more than ten years of service with the Corporation.
Executive has offered to submit his resignation as a director upon his Early Retirement in accordance with the Corporation's corporate governance guidelines, and the Board desires to retain the services of Executive as a director and Chairman of the Board for a period of time after his Early Retirement.
Executive and the Board desire to fix the terms governing his Early Retirement and his continued service as a director and Chairman of the Board.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . Executive shall retire as an employee and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and as a director and Chairman of the Board of Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC effective December 31, 2009. The Employment Agreement dated as of January 1, 2009 between Executive and the Corporation (the "Standard Employment Agreement") and the Employment Agreement dated as of January 1, 2009 (dealing with compensation and benefit issues if there were to be a Change of Control of the Corporation) (the "Change of Control Agreement") shall both continue in effect until Executive's Early Retirement on December 31, 2009. Upon his Early Retirement, the Standard Employment Agreement and Change of Control Agreement shall terminate, except that the non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality provisions contained in Sections 5.2 through 5.6 and the indemnification provision contained in Section 6 of the Standard Employment Agreement shall continue in effect thereafter in accordance with their respective terms.
Early Retirement as Employee
2. . Executive shall continue to be a participant in the Corporation's incentive compensation plans until his Early Retirement in accordance with the terms of those plans and Section 3.2 of the Standard Employment Agreement. After his Early Retirement, the provisions of the incentive compensation plans governing employees who qualify for Early Retirement shall govern the awards to Executive under the plans. The specific application of the provisions of selected incentive compensation plans to Executive's continued employment through December 31, 2009 and his Early Retirement are set forth below. Capitalized terms used in each of the following subparagraphs of this Paragraph 2 shall have the same meaning as set forth in the referenced incentive compensation plan.
Incentive Compensation Plans
(a) . Executive has been awarded Stock Options and Deferred Stock under the ICP. The rules regarding Retirement under the ICP apply to Executive since Retirement is defined in Section 1(r) of the ICP to include Early Retirement. Under the authority granted to it under the ICP, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") has agreed to accelerate the vesting of all unvested Stock Options that are outstanding on December 31, 2009, such that they will become immediately exercisable for the period set out in Section 5(h) of the ICP. Pursuant to the Deferred Stock Award Agreements ("Award Agreements") setting forth the terms of the Deferred Stock awarded to Executive under the ICP, the Deferred Stock shall continue to vest after Executive's Early Retirement in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreements, but in no event later than the fifth anniversary of the Award Date in each respective Award Agreement.
The Corporation's Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP")
(b) . The Executive's entitlement to Accrued Bonuses under the EVA Plan for the 2009 and 2010 Plan Years will be determined in accordance with the terms of the EVA Plan, consistent with the Executive's factors under the EVA Plan and the treatment of other executive officers for the applicable Plan Year. Pursuant to the Executive's Consent dated June 2, 2009, the Accrued Bonus owing to Executive under the EVA Plan for the 2009 Plan Year will be paid in December of 2009. Pursuant to Section VII(D) of the EVA Plan, the Executive's Accrued Bonus for the 2010 Plan Year will be determined based on the number of weeks he is employed by the Corporation during the 2010 Plan Year, since Executive's employment during the 2010 Plan Year will be terminated by reason of Early Retirement.
The Corporation's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation Plan (the "EVA Plan")
(c) . The Executive's entitlement to an incentive payment (in the form of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock) under the PSI Plan for the 2009 and 2010 Plan Years will be determined in accordance with the terms of the PSI Plan, consistent with the Executive's goals under the PSI Plan and the treatment of other executive officers for the applicable Plan Year. Pursuant to Section 3.0 of the PSI Plan, if there is an award to Executive for the 2010 Plan Year, the provisions governing a termination of employment for Early Retirement under Section VII(D) of the EVA Plan will be applied to determine amounts owing to Executive under the PSI Plan. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate the Corporation to continue the PSI Plan for the 2010 Plan Year, consistent with the Committee's authority under Section 7.0 of the PSI Plan to terminate it at any time.
The Corporation's Powerful Solution Incentive Compensation Program (the "PSI Plan")
(d) . The Executive's entitlement to an award (in the form of Restricted and/or Deferred Stock and Premium Stock Options ("PSOs")) under the POSA Program for the 2009 and 2010 Plan Years will be determined in accordance with the terms of the POSA Program, consistent with the Executive's goals under the POSA Program and the treatment of other executive officers for the applicable Plan Year, taking
The Corporation's Premium Option and Stock Award Program (the "POSA Program")
 
into account Executive's Early Retirement on December 31, 2009 for the 2010 Plan Year. Because of limitations contained on the amount of Stock Options that can be awarded to Executive under the POSA Program and the ICP, Executive has a carryover (denominated in dollars) from the 2008 Plan Year and the 2009 Plan Year to future years in the amount of $420,226.00. PSOs equivalent in value (as historically determined under the POSA Program) to the amount of the carryover shall be awarded to Executive on the date on which options are awarded to the Corporation's executive officers during the 2010 calendar year, except that such award shall be made on the day prior to the last day that Executive is a member of the Board in the event the Committee determines that Executive would not be eligible to receive such award on the normal 2010 award date. Consistent with the treatment of Executive's other options, the PSOs awarded to Executive in 2010 shall vest immediately and shall remain exercisable until the third anniversary of their date of grant.
3. . The Board shall nominate Executive for re-election as a director of the Corporation at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. If Executive is re-elected as a director at the 2009 annual meeting, he shall continue to serve as director and Chairman of the Board until conclusion of the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, at which time his retirement from these positions shall become effective. If Executive is not re-elected as a director at the 2009 annual meeting, he shall submit to the Board his resignation as a director and Chairman of the Board to be effective upon acceptance by the Board in its sole discretion, but no later than conclusion of the 2010 annual meeting.
Continued Service as Director
4. . The Board shall designate Executive as Chairman Emeritus for the period from his retirement as Chairman of the Board of the Corporation through December 31, 2012.
Designation as Chairman Emeritus
5. . As consideration for his commitment to serve as a director and Chairman of the Board of the Corporation following his Early Retirement, the Corporation shall provide Executive with the following compensation and benefits:

(a) The same annual compensation provided to non-employee directors of the Corporation pro rated for attendance at 3 of 4 quarterly Board meetings during calendar year 2010, reimbursement for reasonable travel and lodging expenses incurred to attend Board meetings, and the same travel insurance provided to non-employee directors;
(b) A monthly cash payment of $4,166.67 for each month during which Executive serves as the non-employee Chairman of the Board of the Corporation;
(c) A suitable office to be selected by Executive off-site in the Milwaukee metropolitan area for the period from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012, including part-time services of an administrative assistant and telecommunications service in order to provide consultation to the Corporation as needed; and
 
(d) Continued eligibility for the same medical, dental and vision care benefits that are provided to employees of the Corporation and their spouses until Executive reaches the age of 65 and his spouse reaches the age of 65 (or such other age as may be established for eligibility for the Medicare program), provided that Executive shall pay the actuarial value of such benefits as determined annually by the Corporation for active employees.
6. . Nothing contained herein shall adversely reduce or affect the eligibility of Executive or his family or the amount of compensation and benefits to which Executive or his family may be entitled under any qualified and non-qualified retirement and welfare benefit plans or programs of the Corporation during his employment by the Corporation or because of his Early Retirement.
Compensation and Benefits During Period of Employment and After Early Retirement
7. . All notices, requests, demands, or other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given (a) upon confirmation of facsimile or e-mail, (b) one business day following the date delivered by a nationally-recognized overnight courier service, or (c) five business days following the date mailed when mailed by first-class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid, addressed:

On October 14, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") approved a modification to the Company's form of change of control agreement executed with new officers of the Company after October 14, 2009.

(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
AGREEMENT by and between Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company") and                      (the "Executive"), dated as of the              day of             , 20    .
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
1. . (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company or this Agreement is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment or of this Agreement (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment or purported termination of this Agreement.
Certain Definitions
(b) The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate three years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.
2. . For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean:
Change of Control
(a) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company
 
Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this Section 2; or
(b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
(c) Approval by the shareholders of the Company and the subsequent consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or
(d) Approval by the shareholders of the Company and the subsequent consummation of (i) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than to a corporation, with respect to which following such sale or other disposition, (A) more than 60% of, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock

In the event that (a) despite the requirement of this subparagraph (ii), the Annual Bonus for any fiscal year during the Employment Period is less than the Recent Annual Bonus (as a result of either a reduction in the targeted bonus amounts, or a failure to meet performance goals), or (b) the Executive's services are terminated during any fiscal year, the amount and timing of the cash bonus for such fiscal year (payable under Section 9 of the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan) shall not be affected by any payments made under Section 6 below.

(b) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For the sole and exclusive purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
Cause
(i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(c) . The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For the sole and exclusive purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean any of the following events as determined in good faith by the Executive:
Good Reason
(i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting
 
requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities;
(ii) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement;
(iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
(iv) any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
(v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Good Reason" shall not be deemed to have occurred under this Agreement unless the Executive has provided the Company with a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the event or condition that constitutes "Good Reason" and the Company has failed to cure the event or condition within 30 days.
(d) . Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
(e) . "Date of Termination" means (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

MILWAUKEE, WI October 22, 2009/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation today announced fiscal 2010 first quarter consolidated net sales of $324.6 million and a net loss of $8.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales decreased $133.5 million or 29% from the prior year while the net loss was $6.7 million greater than the same period a year ago. The $133.5 million consolidated net sales decrease was primarily the result of weaker shipments of both portable generators and engines. The increase in the net loss of $6.7 million was primarily the result of lower sales volumes in both reportable segments and a less favorable effective tax rate, partially offset by lower production costs and operating expenses.
Engines:
Fiscal 2010 first quarter net sales were $210.4 million, $48.2 million or 19% less than the prior year. This decrease reflects a 22% decrease in engine unit shipments compared to the same period a year ago. The reduction in engine unit volume was attributable to consumer demand for lawn and garden equipment that was softer than that experienced in the same period a year ago and the decrease in demand for engines for portable generators due to the lack of landed hurricanes this year versus the activity experienced in the first quarter last year.
The fiscal 2010 first quarter loss from operations was $5.9 million, which is $0.4 million more than the $5.5 million loss from operations experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. This increase in the loss from operations over the prior year was the result of a decrease in engine unit shipments and an increased provision for potential uncollectible receivables, offset by lower production costs and operating expenses. The lower production costs are primarily the result of lower costs for purchased materials and components, lower transportation costs and lower warranty expenses. Operating expenses were lower in the fiscal 2010 first quarter compared to the prior year period, due primarily to planned reductions in selling and engineering expenses.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2010 first quarter net sales were $163.6 million, $91.9 million or 36% less than the prior year. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from decreased sales of portable generators due to the lack of hurricanes making landfall in the United States in this year's first quarter. In addition, unit shipments of all lawn and garden products were soft, especially the premium equipment that we sell through the dealer channel.
The fiscal 2010 first quarter income from operations was $3.6 million, an improvement of $1.0 million from the income from operations of $2.6 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. This improvement in income from operations between years resulted from lower production costs for materials and components and improved absorption related to the mix of product manufactured, partially offset by lower sales.
General:
Interest expense was lower between years because of lower outstanding borrowings. The effective tax rate was 36% versus the 71% used in the first quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was significantly higher than the 2010 period because 2009 included the favorable tax impact of foreign dividends.
Outlook:
The company continues to project that fiscal 2010 net income will be in the range of $40 to $50 million or $0.80 to $1.01 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be lower between years primarily due to the absence of hurricane related sales of portable generators and selected price reductions to reflect projected lower commodity costs. Production levels for substantially all products are planned to be lower in fiscal 2010 to decrease our investment in working capital. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 4.0% to 5.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $27 million and $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 31% to 34%.
The company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 837-9779. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

On October 21, 2009 the shareholders approved an amended and restated Briggs & Stratton Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan.
(e) Modified Compensatory Plan.
 
 
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
Section 1. Purpose; Definitions.
The purpose of the Plan is to enable key employees and directors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as appropriate third parties who can provide valuable services to the Company, to participate in the Company's future by offering them proprietary interests in the Company. The Plan also provides a means through which the Company can attract and retain such persons.
For purposes of the Plan, the following terms are defined as set forth below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the term "Change in Control" has the meaning set forth in Section 11(b).
Section 2. Administration.
For awards that may be granted to eligible employees, the Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board or such other committee of the Board, which shall be constituted to permit the Plan to comply with Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m) of the Code, who shall be appointed by the Board and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Board. If at any time no Committee shall be in office, the functions of the Committee specified in the Plan shall be exercised by the Board. For awards that may be granted to directors and appropriate third parties, the Plan shall be administered by the entire Board. The term "Committee" shall refer to the Compensation Committee of the Board or such other committee appointed by the Board with respect to the awards granted to eligible employees and the entire Board with respect to awards that may be granted to directors and appropriate third parties.
The Committee shall have plenary authority to grant to eligible employees, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock and Cash Bonus Awards. The Committee shall have plenary authority to grant to directors, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Directors' Fees in Stock, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock. The Committee shall have plenary authority to grant to appropriate third parties, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock.
In particular, the Committee shall have the authority, subject to the terms of the Plan:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may act only by a majority of its members then in office, except that the members thereof may authorize (a) any one or more of their number or any officer of the Company to execute and deliver documents on behalf of the Committee, and (b) the chief executive officer of the Company to grant Restricted and Deferred Stock to key employees who are not officers of the Company.
Any determination made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan with respect to any award shall be made in its sole discretion at the time of the grant of the award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan, at any time thereafter. All decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company and Plan participants.
Section 3. Stock Subject to Plan.
The total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for future distribution under the Plan upon its approval by shareholders at the 2009 annual meeting shall be 6,800,000 shares. Such shares may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. Solely for the purpose of applying the limitation set forth herein, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by 1.00 share of Stock for every one share of Stock granted in respect of an award of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right and 2.91 shares of Stock for every one share of Stock granted in respect of an award other than an award of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right. All shares in aggregate shall be available for issuance as Incentive Stock Options.
Any shares of Stock related to awards under this Plan that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of shares of Stock, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares of Stock, or are exchanged with the Committee's permission prior to the issuance of shares of Stock for awards not involving shares of Stock, shall be available again for grant under this Plan. The preceding sentence shall not be applicable with respect to (i) cancellation of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option upon the exercise of the Stock Option or (ii) cancellation of a Stock Option granted in tandem with a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right. Furthermore, the following shares of Stock may not again be made available for issuance under this Plan: (a) shares of Stock not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (b) shares of Stock used to pay the option price or grant price or withholding taxes related to an outstanding award, or (c) shares of Stock repurchased on the open market with the proceeds from the exercise of a Stock Option.
 
In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or other change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, such substitution or adjustments shall be made in the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, in the number and option price of shares subject to outstanding Stock Options, and in the number of shares subject to other outstanding awards granted under the Plan as may be determined to be appropriate by the Board, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of shares subject to any award shall always be a whole number. Such adjusted option price shall also be used to determine the amount payable by the Company upon the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right associated with any Stock Option.
Except as stated above, no additional shares shall be added to the Plan without prior shareholder approval.
Section 4. Eligibility.
Officers and other key employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth and profitability of the business of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates are eligible to be granted Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock and Cash Bonus Awards. However, no employee shall be eligible to receive awards covering more than 230,000 Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights and 160,000 shares of Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock in any fiscal year. Directors of the Company are eligible to be granted Non-Qualified Stock Options and Directors' Fees in Stock, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock. Appropriate third parties are eligible to be granted Non-Qualified Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock.
Section 5. Stock Options.
Stock Options may be granted alone or in addition to other awards granted under the Plan and may be of two types: Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock Options. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.
The Committee shall have the authority to grant any optionee Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options or both types of Stock Options (in each case with or without Stock Appreciation Rights). Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 425(f) of the Code). To the extent that any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option.
Stock Options shall be evidenced by option agreements, the terms and provisions of which may differ. An option agreement shall indicate on its face whether it is an agreement for Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options. The grant of a Stock Option shall occur on the date the Committee specifies by resolution, which shall be on or after the date it selects an individual as a participant in any grant of Stock Options, determines the number of Stock Options to be granted to such individual and specifies the terms and provisions of the option agreement. The Company shall notify a participant of any grant of Stock Options, and a written option agreement or agreements shall be duly executed and delivered by the Company.
Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of the Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended or altered nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be exercised so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the optionee affected, to disqualify any Incentive Stock Option under such Section 422.
Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem desirable:
 
 
 
 
Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price. As determined by the Committee, the purchase price may be paid (i) by certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Company may accept, (ii) by means of tendering shares of Stock, either directly or by attestation ("Delivered Stock"), (iii) by surrendering to the Company shares of Stock otherwise receivable upon exercise of the Stock option (a "Net Exercise"), or (iv) a combination of the foregoing. Delivered Stock and shares of Stock used in a Net Exercise shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the Stock Option is exercised; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the right to make a payment in the form of already owned shares may be authorized only at the time the Stock Option is granted.
No shares of Stock shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares and the right to receive dividends, with respect to shares subject to the Stock Option when the optionee has given written notice of exercise, has paid in full for such shares and, if requested, has given the representation described in Section 14(a).
 
 
 
 
 
Section 6. Stock Appreciation Rights.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 7. Restricted Stock.
 
The Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals or such other factors or criteria as the Committee shall determine. The provisions of Restricted Stock awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
"The transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of The Briggs & Stratton Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan and a Restricted Stock Agreement. Copies of such Plan and Agreement are on file at the offices of Briggs & Stratton Corporation, 12301 West Wirth Street, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin 53222."
The Committee may require that the certificates evidencing such shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock award, the participant shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Stock covered by such award.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 8. Deferred Stock.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 9. Cash Bonus Awards.
 
 
 
 
 
Section 10. Directors' Fees in Stock
The Board (acting as the Committee under the Plan) may pay all, or such portion as it shall from time to time determine, of the retainer and fees payable to the members of the Board in shares of Stock, Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock. The number of shares to be issued to directors, in lieu of the cash compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled, shall be determined by the Board. The Board may permit or require directors to defer the issuance of Stock hereunder in accordance with such rules as the Board may determine.
Section 11. Change In Control Provisions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 12. Amendments and Termination.
The Board may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of an optionee under a Stock Option or a recipient of a Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock award, Deferred Stock award and Cash Bonus Award theretofore granted without the optionee's or recipient's consent, or without the approval of the Company's stockholders, if shareholder approval of the change would be required to comply with Rule 16b-3 or the Code.
The Committee may amend the terms of any Stock Option or other award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but no such amendment shall impair the rights of any holder without the holder's consent. Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options or SARs, and further outstanding Stock Options or SARs may not be cancelled in exchange for cash, other awards or Stock Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Stock Options or SARs without shareholder approval.
Subject to the above provisions, the Board shall have authority to amend the Plan to take into account changes in law and tax and accounting rules, as well as other developments.
Section 13. Unfunded Status of Plan.
It is presently intended that the Plan constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Stock or make payments; provided, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.
Section 14. General Provisions.
 
All certificates for shares of Stock or other securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed and any applicable Federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

MILWAUKEE, WI January 14, 2010/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced second quarter fiscal 2010 consolidated net sales of $393.0 million and consolidated net income of $3.0 million or $0.06 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2009 had consolidated net sales of $477.5 million and consolidated net income of $3.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales decreased $84.5 million between years, with both reporting segments experiencing lower sales, primarily the result of lower unit volumes. Consolidated net income was fairly consistent between years despite the sales decline. This result reflects better margins caused by lower manufacturing costs and lower engineering, selling, general and administrative costs.
For the first six months of fiscal 2010, the company had consolidated net sales of $717.7 million and a consolidated net loss of $5.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $935.6 million and consolidated net income was $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The decrease in the first six months' consolidated net sales of $217.9 million was attributable to both reporting segments experiencing lower sales, primarily the result of lower unit volumes. Consolidated net income declined by $6.9 million between years resulting from lower volumes of product both shipped and manufactured, offset in part by manufacturing and operating costs that were lower than in the same period a year ago.
Engines:
Fiscal 2010 second quarter net sales were $274.3 million versus $339.3 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of 19%. The decrease resulted primarily from a 15% decrease in engine unit shipments between quarters driven by lower shipments for lawn and garden applications as some OEMs are delaying deliveries of engines to control their inventory investment ahead of an uncertain market environment for the spring of 2010. In addition, engine requirements for portable generators were down due to the lack of any significant weather events and engine shipments for snow thrower applications were down because of shifts in placement.
Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2010 were $484.7 million versus $597.9 million in the prior year, a 19% decrease. This decrease reflects an 18% decrease in engine unit shipments between years. The first six months sales decline in engine unit volume resulted from primarily the same reasons discussed for the second quarter in addition to light first quarter sales of engines because 2009 summer retail demand for lawn and garden equipment was soft and did not generate the same level of engine reorders that occurred in the prior year.
The second quarter of fiscal 2010 had income from operations of $18.0 million versus $22.0 million from the same period a year ago. The decrease of $4.0 million in income from operations reflects the impact of a 19% revenue decrease and a 6% decrease in production volume offset by lower manufacturing and operating costs, resulting primarily from lower commodity costs and planned cost savings initiatives.
Income from operations for the first half of fiscal 2010 was $12.1 million, a $4.4 million decrease from income from operations of $16.5 million for the same period a year ago. The decrease of $4.4 million in income from operations was the result of a 19% revenue decrease and a 10% decrease in production volume offset by the same factors described in the quarter.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2010 second quarter net sales were $156.6 million, a $35.4 million decrease from the $192.0 million in the same period a year ago. The lower net sales were primarily the result of a decrease in shipments of portable generator product. Replenishment demand that occurred because of major weather events last year was not required in the current year due to a lack of weather events. In general, all lawn and garden product volumes were
less than those in the same period a year ago, except for stronger snow thrower shipments. All levels of the lawn and garden distribution channel appear to be managing to lower inventory levels ahead of the spring of 2010 retail season.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2010 were $320.2 million, a $127.4 million decrease over the same period a year ago. The sales decline was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of portable generators due to no hurricanes making landfall in the United States in the first half of fiscal 2010. Other than a small increase in pressure washer shipments, the other product offerings in this reporting segment had volume declines between years.
The loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $4.5 million, an improvement of $4.1 million over the loss for the same period a year ago. The improvement in the loss from operations for the quarter was the result of lower manufacturing costs, primarily related to lower commodity costs and planned cost saving initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by lower sales, lower production volumes and $1.7 million of expenses associated with the previously announced closing of the Jefferson, Wisconsin manufacturing facility.
The loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2010 was $0.9 million, a $5.1 million improvement over the loss from operations for the same period a year ago. The improvement in the loss from operations between years resulted from the same factors as described for the quarter and was also offset year to date by an unfavorable mix of lawn and garden product shipments. Through the first six months of fiscal 2010, costs related to the closure of the Jefferson, Wisconsin facility were $3.1 million.
General:
Interest expense was lower in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2010 because of lower average borrowings. The second quarter and year to date fiscal 2010 effective tax rates are at 29% and 39%, respectively, versus the 30% and 155% used in the same respective periods last year. The difference between the effective tax rates for the six month periods was due to the impact of higher levels of discrete items related to foreign dividends in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2010.
Outlook:
The company continues to project that fiscal 2010 net income will be in the range of $40 to $50 million or $0.80 to $1.01 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be approximately 6% lower between years primarily due to the absence of hurricane related sales of portable generators, selected price reductions to reflect projected lower commodity costs and lower engine shipments to Europe for lawn and garden applications. Production levels for substantially all products are planned to be lower in fiscal 2010 to decrease our investment in working capital. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 4.0% to 5.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted at $27 million and $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 31% to 34%.
The company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EST) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 281-4322. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

On February 24, 2010, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Stipulation of Settlement that, if given court approval, will resolve over 65 class-action lawsuits that have been filed against Briggs & Stratton and other engine and lawnmower manufacturers alleging, among other things, misleading power labeling on its lawnmower engines.
In addition to the Company, the Stipulation of Settlement was entered into by (i) Sears, Roebuck and Co., Sears Holdings Corporation, and Kmart Holdings Corporation ; (ii) Deere & Company; (iii) Tecumseh Products Company; (iv) The Toro Company; and (v) Electrolux Home Products, Inc., and Husqvarna Outdoor Products, Inc. (now known as Husqvarna Consumer Outdoor Products, N.A., Inc.) (collectively "Settling Defendants").
As part of the Stipulation of Settlement, the Settling Defendants have agreed to establish a class wide cash settlement fund totaling $51 million, as well as certain injunctive relief concerning the power labeling of engines for the next ten years. In addition, Briggs & Stratton will offer a one year extension of its current warranty for all class members filing a claim.
Briggs & Stratton is required to fund its portion of the cash settlement in conjunction with specified approval dates that are projected to occur between the execution of the Stipulation of Settlement and June 2011. The Company expects to recognize a pretax expense of approximately $31 million ($19 million after tax) in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 to reflect the impact of the settlement.
The description of the Stipulation of Settlement set forth above is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stipulation of Settlement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the press release announcing the entry into the Stipulation of Settlement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
This Stipulation of Settlement dated as of February 24, 2010 ("Stipulation") is made and entered into by and among the following Settling Parties to the Actions, as those terms are defined herein: (i) Proposed Class Representatives, on behalf of themselves and each of the Settlement Class Members, by and through Settlement Class Counsel; and (ii) the Settling Defendants, by and through Settling Defendants' Counsel. This Stipulation is intended by the Settling Parties to fully, finally and forever resolve, discharge and settle all released rights and claims, as set forth below, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
The following cases were filed by plaintiffs in, or were removed to, various U.S. District Courts and were subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin for all pretrial purposes pursuant to transfer orders from the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation:
 
 
 
The above listed cases have been coordinated for alt pretrial purposes by and through the Practice and Procedure Order Upon Transfer Under 28 U.S.C.  1407(a), entered by the Court on December 23, 2008. Settlement Class Counsel has also filed the following three related actions
 
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin: Azzara v. Sears Roebuck & Co. et al., Case No. 2:09-cv-0728-LA (E.D. Wis. July 24, 2009), Thomas v. Sears Roebuck & Co. et al., Case No. 2:09-cv-0729-LA (E.D. Wis. July 24, 2009), and Martinez v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. et al., Case No. 2:09-cv-0469-LA (E.D. Wis. May 7, 2009) (the "Related Actions"). Finally, Settlement Class Counsel has filed in Illinois state court Lemay v. Sears Roebuck & Co. et al., Case No. 08-L85 (St. Clair Cty., Ill.) (the "Lemay Action").
 
Settling Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, each and every claim and allegation of wrongdoing that has been alleged by the plaintiffs in the Actions. Settling Defendants also have denied, and continue to deny, inter alia, any and all allegations that plaintiffs or Settlement Class Members have suffered any damage whatsoever, have been harmed in any way, or are entitled to any relief as a result of any conduct on the part of Settling Defendants as alleged by plaintiffs in the Actions.
Nevertheless, Settling Defendants have concluded that further litigation will likely be protracted and expensive with uncertain results, that settlement of the Actions is therefore advisable to permit the operation of the Settling Defendants' businesses without further litigation expenses and the distraction of executive personnel, and that it is therefore desirable and prudent that the Actions between Proposed Class Representatives, Settlement Class Members, and Settling Defendants be fully and finally resolved and settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.
 
Plaintiffs believe that the claims asserted by them in the Actions have merit and that there is evidence to support their claims. Plaintiffs, however, recognize and acknowledge the expense
 
and length of continued litigation and legal proceedings necessary to prosecute the Actions against Settling Defendants through trial and through any appeals. Plaintiffs also recognize and have taken into account the uncertain outcome and risks associated with litigation and class actions in general, and the Actions in particular, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in any such litigation.
Plaintiffs are also mindful of the potential problems of proof and the possible defenses to class certification and to the unlawful conduct alleged by them in the Actions, as well as to the remedies they seek. As a result, plaintiffs believe that the Settlement set forth in this Stipulation provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members. Plaintiffs and Settlement Class Counsel have therefore determined that the Settlement, as set forth in this Stipulation, is fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interests of the Settlement Class.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED to, by and among the Proposed Class Representatives (for themselves and all Settlement Class Members) and the Settling Defendants, for themselves, by and through their respective counsel of record, that the Actions shall be finally and fully compromised, settled and released, the Actions shall be dismissed with prejudice as to all Released Parties, and that all the claims of the Proposed Class Representatives and the Settlement Class Members shall be released, subject to the terms and conditions of this Stipulation, and subject to the Final Approval Order approving the Stipulation becoming Final as defined herein.

above) shall be consistent with this subsection and in all events shall reflect that all taxes (including any estimated taxes, interest or penalties) on the income earned by the Settlement Fund shall be paid out of the Settlement Fund as provided in Section V.6 hereof.
6. . All (a) taxes (including any estimated taxes, interest or penalties) arising with respect to the income earned by the Settlement Fund, including any taxes or tax detriments that may be imposed upon Settling Defendants with respect to any income earned by the Settlement Fund for any period during which the Settlement Fund does not qualify as a "qualified settlement fund" for federal or state income tax purposes, and (b) expenses and costs incurred in connection with the operation and implementation of this paragraph (including, without limitation, expenses of tax attorneys and/or accountants and mailing and distribution costs and expenses relating to filing (or failing to file) the returns described in Section V.5) shall be paid out of the Settlement Fund. In no event shall Settling Defendants have any responsibility for or liability with respect to the taxes or tax related expenses.

Further, taxes and tax related expenses shall be treated as, and considered to be, a cost of administration of the Settlement Fund and shall be timely paid by the Escrow Agent out of the Settlement Fund without prior order from the Court, and the Escrow Agent shall be obligated (notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary) to withhold from distribution any funds necessary to pay such amounts, including the establishment of adequate reserves for any taxes and tax related expenses (as well as any amounts that may be required to be withheld under Treas. Reg.  1.468B2(l)(2)) (or any successor regulation); Settling Defendants are not responsible therefore nor shall they have any liability with respect thereto.

7. . The Settling Parties agree to follow the notice procedures specified in the Notice Plan, as approved by the Court.
Notice Procedures
8. . Settling Defendants shall have no responsibility for the expense of notice to the Settlement Class pursuant to the Notice Plan or the expense of administration of the Settlement Fund. Expenses of notice and administration for this Settlement shall be invoiced by the Notice Administrator and the Claims Administrator, respectively, and can be paid from this Settlement Fund. In no event shall the total expenses associated with notice and administration increase the amount owed by Settling Defendants as part of the Settlement. In no event shall the Settlement Class Counsel be responsible for the expense of notice to the Settlement Class.
Expenses of Notice and Administration
9. . Subject to approval by the Court, the Settling Parties agree to the following distribution of the Net Settlement Fund.
Plan of Distribution of the Net Settlement Fund
a. Each Settlement Class Member who is not an Opt-Out and submits a valid and timely claim to the Claims Administrator shall receive up to $35.00, if the claim is for a walk-behind lawn mower purchased by the Settlement Class Member; or up to $75.00, if the claim is for a riding lawn mower purchased by the Settlement Class Member.
b. For a claim to be valid, a Settlement Class Member must submit a claim form with the information set forth in this Section V.9.b. to the Claims Administrator within the Monetary Relief Claims Period (as defined in the Notice) via the Internet or by mail. The Claims Administrator shall maintain a website and a toll free telephone
 
number through which Settlement Class Members may obtain and submit claim forms. The claim form will request that a Settlement Class Member submit his or her full name, current address, and the brand of the lawnmower, brand of the engine, the engine model number, and the lawnmower identification number for the lawnmower for which a claim is being submitted. To the extent that a Settlement Class Member submits a claim form without some of the information listed in the preceding sentence, if the Claims Administrator is able to ascertain the missing information from the information provided by the Settlement Class Member sufficient to establish that it is a valid claim, the Claims Administrator may deem the claim as valid for purposes of receiving a distribution from the Net Settlement Fund. The claim form shall further require that the Settlement Class Member affirm under oath that all of the information on the claim form is true and correct and that between January 1, 1994 and the date of the Notice he or she purchased, for his or her use and not for resale, the lawnmower for which a claim is being submitted.
c. If the aggregate amount of valid claims received by the Claims Administrator exceeds the Net Settlement Fund, the amount each claimant receives under Section V.9.a. shall be reduced pro rata by the percentage necessary to permit payment of all valid claims. Any portion of the Net Settlement Fund not distributed to Settlement Class Members shall be disposed of pursuant to an order of the Court. In any event, upon the Final Approval Order becoming Final, no part of the Settlement Fund or Net Settlement Fund shall revert to the Settling Defendants.
d. Any order of the Court requiring modification of the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund as set forth in Section V.9 shall not affect the approval or finality of this Settlement. Except as provided by order of the Court pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, including an order approving a plan of distribution, no Settlement Class Member shall have any interest in the Settlement Fund or any portion thereof.
 
10. . Each Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant agrees to make available to each Settlement Class Member who is not an Opt-Out and who purchased a lawnmower with an engine manufactured and warranted by such Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant, a warranty extension of one-year on such engine warranty ("Warranty Relief"). Briggs & Stratton shall provide the Warranty Relief only for engines both manufactured and warranted by Briggs & Stratton. Toro shall provide the Warranty Relief only for engines both manufactured and warranted by Toro. Tecumseh shall provide the Warranty Relief only for engines both manufactured and warranted by Tecumseh. For purposes of Warranty Relief only, engines manufactured and warranted by Tecumseh Power Company shall be treated as if they were manufactured and warranted by Tecumseh.
Warranty Relief
a. With respect to engine warranties issued by the Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendants that are still in effect when the Final Approval Order becomes Final, such Warranty Relief will add one year to the engine warranties. For all warranty extensions, the terms of the extended warranty (other than its duration), including all exclusions, shall be the same as the Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant's warranty that is in effect when the Final Approval Order becomes Final.
b. With respect to engine warranties issued by the Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendants that expired prior to the Final Approval Order becoming Final, such Warranty Relief will provide a one-year warranty commencing on the date the Final Approval Order becomes Final. For all such extended warranties, the terms of the extended warranty (other than its duration), including all exclusions, shall be the same as the Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant's most recent engine warranty as of the date of this Settlement Agreement.
 
c. Settlement Class Members have up to one year from the date that the Final Approval Order becomes Final to make a claim for and to obtain the benefits of the Warranty Relief described in this Section V.10 (the "Warranty Relief Claims Period"). Upon a Settlement Class Member's submission of a claim form within the Warranty Relief Claims Period and containing the information set forth in Section V.9.b. for a lawnmower containing an engine manufactured and warranted by a Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant and requesting an extended warranty, the Settlement Class Member shall receive a certificate evidencing the Warranty Relief as to the Settlement Class Member's lawn mower engine(s) identified on the claim form. Settlement Class Members who submit a claim form within the Warranty Relief Claims Period but after the Monetary Relief Claims Period has expired shall not be entitled to share in any distribution of the Net Settlement Fund.
d. To obtain the benefits of the Warranty Relief, a Class Member must present the certificate to a facility authorized to service the engine in issue, along with the lawnmower and engine identified in the certificate within one year after the Final Approval Order becomes Final and the engine failure must meet the terms and conditions of the warranty issued by the applicable Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant.
e. To the extent any additional settlements are made with non-settling Defendants in the Actions, Settlement Class Counsel will use its best efforts to obtain the agreement of each Defendant that is not a Settling Defendant to provide an extended warranty to Class Members who purchased that Defendant's lawnmowers or lawnmower engines on terms substantially the same as the Warranty Relief.
 
11. . The Settling Defendants agree to the following governing future horsepower testing and labeling of lawnmower engines ("Injunctive Relief").
Injunctive Relief
a. If any engine is given a horsepower rating or a torque rating displayed either on the engine or the lawnmower, or in any written materials intended to accompany the engine or the lawnmower at the time of retail sale to a consumer, the engine rating must be in compliance with this Injunctive Relief and all SAE testing and labeling standards, and identify: 1) the displacement (in cubic centimeters) of the engine; and 2) the "Certified Power Rating" as defined below. The party that is testing the engine and obtaining the Certified Power Rating (whether engine manufacturer or OEM) shall be responsible for compliance with these injunctive relief requirements.
Engine and Lawnmower Power Rating
:
b. The "Certified Power Rating" is the power rating performed in accordance with the testing and labeling standards of the SAE and pursuant to this injunctive relief as certified by a "Certified Engine Tester." A "Certified Engine Tester" is an independent testing entity or person who is not employed by any engine manufacturer, lawn mower manufacturer or other defendant in this litigation. All Certified Engine Testers shall be either a United States resident, subject to service of process within the United States, or consent to service of process at a designated location.
Requirements to Obtain a "Certified Power Rating" for Lawnmower Engines
:
(1) : Engine testing equipment, (e.g., dynamometers and any other measuring devices) must be calibrated within 90
Equipment Calibration
 
days prior to the tests. The Certified Engine Tester shall certify the calibration test performed and that the testing equipment meets the specifications of the testing standard.
(2) : All gross horsepower or torque tests will be conducted in accordance with SAE J1995. All net horsepower or torque tests will be conducted in accordance with SAE J1349.
Testing Standards
(3) : All engine testing will be performed at the engine manufacturer's production locations, the OEM's production locations if the OEM is testing and certifying the engine, or such other appropriately equipped testing location.
Test Locations
(4) : All engine testing will be performed by, or on behalf of, the engine manufacturer or OEM (if the OEM is testing and certifying the engine).
Manufacturer Testing
(5) : Engines will be selected, at random, by the engine manufacturer from existing stock for existing engine models or from pre-production stock for new engine models. At least one engine used in the testing that support test results will be retained by engine manufacturer for as long as the test results are relied on by the engine manufacturer.
Engine Selection & Retention
(6) : A Certified Engine Tester shall personally conduct and certify, or personally witness and certify, with respect to the results of the engine testing that:
Test Certification
 
 
 
 
(7) : A Certified Power Rating is required one time only for each engine model. If the manufacturer alters the manufacturing process or if any changes are made to an engine that changes the engine horsepower or torque from the previously certified rating, that engine must be subjected to testing to obtain a new Certified Power Rating.
Frequency in Obtaining a Certified Power Rating
(8) : Certified Power Rating test results (e.g., power curves used to establish a 95% confidence interval for a given engine) will be publicly available on either the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute website or the engine manufacturer's website within 30 days after Certified Power Rating results. The written materials intended to accompany the engine or the lawnmower at the time of retail sale must contain information sufficient to identify where a consumer can view the Certified Power Rating Test Results.
Publishing Test Results
(9) : The Settling Defendants shall have a period of twelve (12) months from the date the Final Approval Order becomes Final to comply with this injunctive relief. This injunctive relief will be effective for a period of ten (10) years from the date the Final Approval Order becomes Final.
Timing
 
(10) : Settling Defendants who are in the business of manufacturing lawnmowers or lawnmower engines or become involved in the business of manufacturing lawnmowers or lawnmower engines during the period in which the Injunctive Relief is in effect agree to use their best good faith efforts to amend SAE J1995 to reflect the red-lined changes set forth in Exhibit 2 attached hereto. There is no requirement that the proposed changes actually be adopted by the SAE for Settling Defendants to fulfill their duty pursuant to this Injunctive Relief to present the amendments. All horsepower rating or torque rating displayed by Settling Defendants either on the engine of the lawnmower or in any written materials intended to accompany the engine or lawnmower shall be in compliance with SAE standards.
Proposed Revisions to SAE J1995
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Stipulation shall be construed as requiring Sears to test or label engines. Sears only is agreeing that the lawnmowers it sells will comply with the requirements set forth in this Section V.11. To the extent any additional settlements are made with non-settling Defendants in the Actions, Settlement Class Counsel will use its best efforts to obtain the agreement of each Defendant that is not a Settling Defendant to be subject to the Injunctive Relief set forth in Sections V.11.a. and b. Settlement Class Counsel agree that the Injunctive Relief set forth in this Section V.11 constitutes a New Power Rating Standard as defined in Section 30 of the Settlement Agreement Between Plaintiffs and MTD Products, Inc. dated the 4th day of August, 2006 (the "MTD Settlement Agreement") and Settlement Class Counsel shall use its best efforts have MTD subject to the Injunctive Relief set forth in this Section V.11.
 
12. . Notwithstanding the entry of a Final Approval Order, the Settling Defendants, other than Tecumseh, agree that for purposes of discovery only they may be treated as if they were still a party defendant in the Actions, which discovery shall be governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Any such discovery will be subject to the rules, orders and procedures of the Court or any Subsequent Court. Settlement Class Counsel agree to pursue discovery against Defendants other than the Released Parties prior to seeking discovery from the Released Parties, and to seek discovery from Released Parties only with respect to such information not available from Defendants other than the Released Parties or from other sources. Because Tecumseh is not in the business of manufacturing or selling lawnmower engines, documents relating to Tecumseh lawnmower engines are owned by TecumsehPower Company, and TecumsehPower Company is no longer an operating company, Tecumseh shall not be considered a Settling Defendant with respect to this provision only and shall be treated as a third party for purposes of discovery.
Settling Defendants' Continuing Discovery Obligations
 
1. . At a time deemed appropriate by Interim Co-Lead Class Counsel, after consultation with the Settling Defendants, Interim Co-Lead Class Counsel shall submit to the Court a motion for preliminary approval ("Preliminary Approval") of the Settlement and a motion for a stay of all proceedings in the Actions as to the Released Parties until the Court renders its final decision on approval of the Settlement. Interim Co-Lead Counsel shall seek an Order requesting, , (i) the Preliminary Approval of the Settlement set forth in the Stipulation, (ii) Certification of the Settlement Class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(3)
Motion for Preliminary Approval
inter alia
 
for settlement purposes only; (iii) appointment of one or more plaintiffs as class representatives thereof and appointing Settlement Class Counsel, (iv) approval of the form and content of the Notice and Notice Plan, and (v) deadlines for persons to file claims, request exclusion from the Settlement Class, or make submissions in support of or opposition to the Settlement. A copy of the proposed order granting Preliminary Approval is attached hereto as Exhibit 3. In the event that the Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement is submitted to the Court on the same day as a motion for preliminary approval of any other settlement agreement (including, but not limited to the MTD Settlement Agreement), Settlement Class Counsel agree to present and have argument on the motions for preliminary approval of the settlement agreements in the order in which the agreements were entered.
2. . In the event that the Court, or any Subsequent Court, grants Preliminarily Approval of the Settlement in the Action or any Subsequent Actions, Settlement Class Counsel shall, in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Court's order, arrange for the Notice to be provided to the Settlement Class in accordance with the Notice Plan approved by the Court.
Notice to Settlement Class
3. . Within 10 calendar days after the final day on which Settlement Class Members may exercise their right to be excluded from the Settlement Class, as established by the Court and as set forth in the Notice, Settlement Class Counsel shall provide to the Settling Defendants in writing a list of names and addresses of all Opt-Outs. In the event that the aggregate number of Opt-Outs exceed the number agreed upon by the Settling Parties, the Settling Defendants shall have the right to withdraw from this Settlement Agreement, upon written notice to Settlement Class Counsel within 10 calendar days after receipt of the list of Opt-Outs. If the Settling Defendants withdraw from this Settlement Agreement under this
Opt-Outs
 
Section, this Settlement Agreement shall be null and void and the Net Settlement Fund shall be returned to the Settling Defendants pro rata in accordance with the amount each Settling Defendant paid into the Fund. The Proposed Class Representatives agree to participate as Settlement Class Members and to not opt-out of this Settlement.
4.. If the Court grants Preliminary Approval and the Settling Defendants have not withdrawn from this Agreement, Settlement Class Counsel and the Settling Defendants shall, at a mutually agreed upon time prior to the Fairness Hearing, jointly request entry of an order and final judgment, in the form attached as Exhibit 4:
Proposed Order and Final Judgment
a. finally approving certification of the Settlement Class for settlement purposes only and finally approving the Settlement without material alteration of its terms;
b. finding that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and directing consummation of the Settlement pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement;
c. finding that dissemination of the class notice in the form and manner directed by the Court was accomplished, was the best notice practicable and satisfies due process;
d. providing that each Settlement Class Member who is not an Opt-Out is bound by this Settlement Agreement regardless of whether the Settlement Class Member submits any claim;
e. approving such requests to opt-out of the Settlement Class as have been timely and properly submitted in accordance the Court's orders;
 
f. directing that any and all claims be dismissed with prejudice as to the Released Parties who are Defendants and, except as provided for herein, without costs to any party;
g. discharging and releasing the Released Parties from any and all Released Claims;
h. reserving continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement and its administration, and any dispute, claim, or action arising out of or related to this Settlement Agreement or its administration;
i. determining pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) that there is no just reason for delay and directing that the judgment of dismissal of the Actions shall be final and appealable; and
j. determining that the Settlement is in good faith and bars, extinguishes, and discharges any claims against the Released Parties by any other Defendant who is not a Released Party for contribution or indemnity under federal or state law; and preserving any claim for contribution or indemnity that a Settling Defendant may have against any other Defendant who is not a Released Party.
 
1. . In addition to the effect of any final judgment entered in accordance with this Settlement Agreement, upon Final Approval Order becoming Final, the Settlement Class Members in the Actions and/or Subsequent Actions as Releasing Parties, release and forever discharge each and all of the Released Parties from all manner of claims, demands, actions, suits, causes of action, whether class, individual, or otherwise in nature, damages of any kind (including but not limited to actual, consequential, special, exemplary and punitive) and
Releases
 
whenever incurred, liabilities of any nature whatsoever, including costs, expenses, penalties and attorneys' fees, known or unknown, derivative or direct, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, in law or equity, including, without limitation, claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted in the Actions against the Released Parties, arising out of or related to the Releasing Party's purchase or purchases of a lawn mower or a lawn mower engine, specifically including any claim of conspiracy against the Released Parties, between January 1, 1994, and the date upon which Notice is first mailed or otherwise published, that any Releasing Party now has, ever had, or may have had as of the date of the Final Approval becomes Final (whether or not the Settlement Class Member objects to the Settlement and whether or not the Settlement Class Member submits a claim seeking to share in the Settlement Fund or has such claim approved or not approved) whether directly, representatively, derivatively or in any other capacity. "Unknown" claims as released herein means any and all claims that any member of the Settlement Class does not know to exist against any of the Released Parties which, if known, might have affected his or her decision to enter into or to be bound by the terms of this Settlement. The plaintiffs and the members of the Settlement Class acknowledge that they may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those that they now know or believe to be true concerning the subject matter of this release, but nevertheless fully, finally, and forever settle and release any and all Released Claims, known or unknown, derivative or direct, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, in law or equity, including, without limitation, claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted in the Actions against the Released Parties, that any Releasing Party now has, ever had, or may have had as of the date of the Final Approval becomes Final. The foregoing waiver includes, without limitation, an express waiver to the fullest extent permitted by law, by the Proposed Class Representatives and the Settlement Class Members of any and all rights under California Civil Code  1542 or any similar law of any other state or of the United States, which provides:
A , .
GENERAL
RELEASE
DOES
NOT

TO

CREDITOR
DOES
NOT

OR

TO
EXIST
IN

OR

RELEASE

OR

SETTLEMENT
WITH
THE
DEBTOR
 
The Settling Parties acknowledge, and the Settlement Class Members shall be deemed by operation of the Final Approval Order to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and a key element of the Settlement of which this release is a part.
Upon the Final Approval Order becoming Final, the Releasing Parties shall not seek to recover against the Released Parties for any of the Released Claims.
2. The Releasing Parties further release and shall not bring any claim or any cause of action that seeks in any way to recover against lawnmower manufacturers, retailers, dealers, and distributors that sell lawn mowers or lawn mower engines manufactured or sold by any Released Party where such claim in any way relates to the horsepower or power ratings, labels or advertising with respect to any lawn mower or lawn mower engine manufactured or sold by any Released Party (but not any other lawn mowers or lawn mower engines manufactured or sold by Defendants other than a Released Party) or in any way related to the contractual relationships between any Released Party and any lawnmower manufacturer, retailer, dealer or distributor or for which any Released Party may be held liable either directly or through a contribution or indemnification claim, except that nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall release any lawnmower manufacturer, retailer, dealer or distributor other than the Released Parties from any liability for (a) such entity's knowing and intentional violation of state or federal law; (b) such
 
entity's knowing and intentional misrepresentations or other intentional tortious conduct; (c) payment disputes; (d) repair or replacement parts or units under warranty, or (e) physical harm or bodily injury.
3. . Pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, each Settlement Class Member settles and releases only the Released Parties and lawnmower manufacturers, retailers, dealers and distributors that the Settlement Class has released pursuant to Sections VII.1. and 2 herein, and the parties do not intend this Settlement Agreement, or any part hereof or any other aspect of the proposed Settlement, to release or otherwise affect in any way any claims or rights any Settlement Class Member has or may have against any other Defendant or party or entity whatsoever. More particularly, the fact or terms of this Settlement with the Settling Defendants and the releases contained herein shall not be construed to release or limit in any way the joint or several liability or damage responsibility of any Defendant or alleged coconspirator other than the Released Parties and lawnmower manufacturers, retailers, dealers, and distributors, released pursuant to Sections VII.1 and 2 herein, for the alleged combination and conspiracy, or for sales or other acts alleged in the Actions, Subsequent Actions or any related action, including, but not limited to, any alleged damage or responsibility for any of the acts of the Released Parties. The rights of any Settlement Class Member to recover the full amount of his judgment from any one or more Defendants who are not Released Parties are unaffected by this Settlement. In addition, neither this Settlement Agreement nor the releases set forth in Sections VII.1. and 2. above shall have any legal effect or other effect on any claims any Released Party may have against any Settlement Class Member for or arising out of accounts receivable, contract obligations, or claims and defenses in unrelated existing or future litigation or bankruptcy proceedings; nor shall this Settlement Agreement or the releases set forth in
Reservation of Claims
 
Sections VII.1. and 2. above release or have any legal or other effect on ordinary commercial or product liability claims arising from the purchase or sale of any Released Party's products that do not involve any claims asserted in the Actions or that could have been asserted in the Actions, including but not limited to claims relating to payment disputes, physical harm or bodily injury, repair or replacement of parts or units under warranty.
4. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Stipulation, in consideration of the terms hereof and in order to induce the Settling Defendants to enter into this Stipulation, the Settlement Class shall exclude from the dollar amount of any judgment in the Actions, any Subsequent Actions, or any action involving similar claims that is collectable against any Defendant who is not a Released Party an amount equal to the percentage or amount of such judgment for which the Released Parties would be responsible pursuant to a valid and enforceable claim for contribution and/or indemnification under federal or state law so as to bar, extinguish, discharge and release under federal and state law any claims for contribution or indemnity against the Released Parties, or any of them, by a Defendant who is not a Released Party.
Indemnity for Claims for Contribution or Indemnification Asserted by Other Defendants
 
1. The Released Parties shall not be responsible for the payment of any attorneys' fees of Plaintiffs' Counsel or costs or expenses of litigation. Rather, Plaintiffs' Counsel may seek payment for litigation expenses (including, without limitation, class representative incentive awards, experts, and settlement escrow expenses) only from the Settlement Fund. The Settling Defendants shall be responsible only for the cost of any notice to state or federal agencies under 28 U.S.C.  1715(b). The Settling Defendants take no position on any application for attorneys
 
fees and expenses. No attorneys' fees shall be paid from the Settlement Fund until the Final Approval Order becomes Final. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after entry of an order of the MDL Court approving fees and expenses, a plaintiffs' counsel or firm in the Actions may give notice to the Settling Defendants that it wishes to be paid attorneys fees and expenses before the Final Approval Order is Final. In that circumstance, attorney fees can be paid from the Settlement Fund only if (1) the request is in compliance with all court orders; (2) the request is in an amount authorized by Settlement Class Counsel, and (3) the requesting plaintiffs' counsel or firm secures the repayment for any such counsel's or firm's fees, plus interest thereon at the prime rate, by a letter of credit or letters of credit on terms and by banks acceptable to Settling Defendants. Each plaintiffs' counsel or firm that is paid attorneys' fees prior to the Final Approval Order becoming Final shall be required to reimburse all or the pertinent portion of that counsel's or firm's payment, plus interest thereon at the prime rate, if the award of attorneys' fees and expenses is reduced or overturned on appeal, or if this Settlement does not become Final. Settling Defendants may present the letter(s) of credit in the event the counsel or firm fails to honor the obligation to repay the amount withdrawn if the attorneys' fee and expenses award is reduced or overturned on appeal, or if this Settlement does not become Final.
2. Any payment approved by the Court pursuant to Section VIII.1. shall constitute full satisfaction of Settling Defendants' and/or any Released Parties' obligations to pay amounts to any person, attorney, or law firm for attorneys' fees, expenses, or costs incurred on behalf of the Proposed Class Representatives and/or the Settlement Class, and shall relieve the Settling Defendants and Released Parties from any other claim or liability to any other attorney or law firm for any attorneys' fees, expenses and/or costs on behalf of the Proposed Class Representatives and/or the Settlement Class. Settlement Class Counsel shall be solely and legally
 
responsible to pay any and all applicable taxes on the payment made pursuant to Section VIII.1 and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Settling Defendants from any claim or liability for taxes, penalties or interest for which Settlement Class Counsel is responsible as a result of the payment made pursuant to Section VIII.1. Settlement Class Counsel further agrees that any allocation of fees between or among Settlement Class Counsel and any other attorney representing the plaintiffs and/or the Settlement Class shall be the sole responsibility of Settlement Class Counsel and Settlement Class Counsel agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties from any claim or liability by any other person or entity claiming or seeking to claim any attorneys' fees or costs.
3. Any award of attorneys' fees and costs and any application for such fees and costs, and any and all matters related thereto, shall not be considered part of the Stipulation, and shall be considered by the Court separately from the Court's consideration of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement, and shall not operate to terminate or cancel the Stipulation or Settlement, and shall not affect or delay the finality of any Final Approval Order approving the Stipulation and the Settlement of the Actions.
 
1. If the Final Approval Order does not become Final, then the Settlement, this Stipulation, and any other stipulation shall become null and void. In addition, the Settling Parties agree that if this Settlement becomes null and void, the Released Parties shall not be prejudiced in any way from opposing the certification of a class or classes in the Actions or in any other litigation that is not one of the Actions, nor shall the Released Parties be prejudiced in any way from asserting any and all other defenses to the claims asserted in the Actions or in any other litigation, or with respect to their assertion of any other rights or remedies. If this Settlement becomes null and void, the Net Settlement Fund shall be returned to Settling Defendants.
 
2. In the event that the Final Approval Order does not become Final, or the Stipulation is terminated, or fails to become effective in accordance with its terms, the Settling Parties and the Settlement Class Members shall be restored to their respective positions in the Actions as of the date of this Settlement Agreement. In such event, the terms and provisions of the Stipulation, with the exception of the last sentence of Section V.1, the second to last sentence of Section VI.3, and Sections IX.1, IX.2, X.4, and X.9 hereof; shall have no further force and effect with respect to the Settling Parties and the Settlement Class Members, and shall not be used in these Actions or in any other proceeding for any purpose, and any judgment or order entered by the Court in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation shall be treated as vacated, nunc pro tunc. Nothing contained in this Settlement Agreement can be used by any person for any purpose with respect to the issues of class certification or the merits of the claims or defenses asserted in the Actions or any related litigation.
 
1. The Settling Parties acknowledge that it is their intent to consummate this Settlement, and agree to cooperate and take whatever steps are necessary and appropriate to complete the Settlement, to obtain Preliminary and Final Approval of the Settlement, to effectuate the terms of the Settlement, and to protect the Settlement by applying for appropriate orders enjoining others from initiating or prosecuting any action arising out of or related to the facts or claims alleged in the Actions, if so required.
2. To the extent any disputes or issues arise with respect to documenting the Settlement, the Settling Parties agree to use their best efforts to informally resolve any such disputes or issues; but in the event any such dispute or issue cannot be resolved informally, to bring any such dispute or issue to the Court for resolution.
 
3. The Settling Parties intend the Settlement to be a final and complete resolution of all disputes between them with respect to the Actions and Subsequent Actions, except as specifically provided for herein. The Settlement compromises claims which are contested and shall not be deemed an admission by any Settling Party as to the merits of any claim or defense. While retaining their right to deny liability, the Settling Defendants agree that the amount paid to the Settlement Fund and the other terms of the Settlement were negotiated at all times at arm's length and in good faith by the Settling Parties, and reflect a settlement that was reached voluntarily after consultation with competent legal counsel. Except as provided in Section VIII.1., each Party shall bear its own costs.
4. Neither the Stipulation nor the Settlement contained therein, nor any act performed or document executed pursuant to or in furtherance of the Stipulation or the Settlement: (a) is or may be deemed to be, or may be used as an admission or evidence of, the validity of any claims asserted in the Actions, or of any wrongdoing or liability on the part of the Released Parties, or (b) is or may be deemed to be, or may be used as an admission or evidence of, any fault or omission of any of the Released Parties in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding in any court, administrative agency or other tribunal. The Released Parties may file the Stipulation and/or the Final Approval Order in any action that has been or may be brought against them in order to support a defense or counterclaim based on principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, release, good faith settlement, judgment bar, reduction, or any other theory of claim preclusion or issue preclusion, or any similar defense or counterclaim.
5. Each obligation of each Settling Defendant under this Settlement Agreement is several and not joint, including each Settling Defendant's obligation to make payments into the
 
Settlement Fund as prescribed in Section V.1. of this Stipulation. In addition, no Settling Defendant other than the Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendants is responsible for providing Warranty Relief under this Settlement Agreement. No Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant is responsible for providing Warranty Relief under this Settlement Agreement as to any engines other than the engines that were initially warranted by that Settling Engine Manufacturer Defendant.
6. No person shall have any claim against any Settling Defendant, Settling Defendant's Counsel, or Settlement Class Counsel based on distribution of benefits made substantially in accordance with this Stipulation of Settlement or any Settlement-related order(s) of the Court.
7. If a case is commenced in respect to a Settling Defendant under Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy), or a trustee, receiver or conservator is appointed under any similar law, and in the event of the entry of a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction determining the transfer of the Settlement Funds, or any portion thereof, by or on behalf such Settling Defendant to be a preference, voidable transfer, fraudulent transfer, or similar transaction, and that Settling Defendant's portion of the Settlement Fund is returned to the Settling Defendant, then, as to that Settling Defendant, the releases given and Final Approval Order entered in its favor pursuant to this Stipulation shall be null and void. After the Settlement is Final, nothing in this Stipulation should be construed to require Settlement Class Counsel or Settlement Class Member to return any amount of money paid to them under the Settlement and the releases provided for herein shall remain in full force and effect.
8. Each Settling Defendant warrants and represents that it is not "insolvent" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.  101(32) as of the time this Stipulation is executed and as of the time any payments are transferred or made as required by this Stipulation.
 
9. All agreements made and Orders entered during the course of the Actions relating to the confidentiality of information shall survive this Stipulation.
10. The Stipulation may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by all Settling Defendants and Settlement Class Counsel, or their respective successors-in-interest.
11. This Stipulation and the agreements referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the Settling Parties, and no representations, warranties or inducements have been made to any Party concerning the Stipulation and the agreements referred to herein, other than those contained therein. The Stipulation and the agreements referred to herein replace and void any and all previous agreements concerning the settlement of the Actions.
12. Settlement Class Counsel, on behalf of the Settlement Class, are expressly authorized by the Court's January 27, 2009, Order to take all appropriate action required or permitted to be taken by the Settlement Class pursuant to the Stipulation to effectuate its terms, and also are expressly authorized to enter into any modifications or amendments to the Stipulation on behalf of the Settlement Class which they deem necessary or appropriate.
13. Each attorney executing the Stipulation on behalf of any party hereto hereby warrants that such attorney has the full authority to do so.
14. This Stipulation may be executed in one or more counterparts. All executed counterparts and each of them shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. A complete set of original executed counterparts shall be filed with the Court.
15. This Stipulation shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the Settling Parties hereto.
 
16. The Court shall retain jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the terms of the Stipulation and for the entry of appropriate orders enjoining others from initiating or prosecuting any action arising out of or related to the facts or claims alleged in the Actions, if so required. The Settling Parties hereto submit to the jurisdiction of the Court for purposes of implementing and enforcing the Settlement embodied in the Stipulation. The Parties shall present the Court with proposed Orders that allow for such a retention of jurisdiction, in accordance with applicable law.
17. The Stipulation shall be considered to have been negotiated, executed and delivered, and to be wholly performed, in the State of Illinois, and the rights and obligations of the parties to the Stipulation shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the internal, substantive laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to that State's choice-of-law principles.
18. This Settlement Agreement shall not provide any rights to, or be enforceable by, any person or entity who is not a Settlement Class Member, a Released Party or Settlement Class Counsel. Absent Court order, no Settlement Class Member or Settlement Class Counsel may assign or otherwise convey any right to enforce any provision of this Settlement Agreement.
19. All notices between the Settling Defendants and Settlement Class Counsel under this Settlement Agreement shall be in writing. Each such notice shall be given either by (a) hand delivery; (b) registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid; (c) first class U.S. mail together with simultaneous facsimile transmission; or (d) an overnight express delivery service and, in the case of either (a), (b) (c) or (d) shall be addressed, if directed to Settlement Class Counsel or counsel for the Settling Defendants, to the addresses set forth on the signature pages hereof, or such other address as any of them may subsequently provide, pursuant to notice in the manner described in this Section.
 
20. Any inconsistency between this Settlement Agreement and any other agreement between the Settlement Class and the Settling Defendants shall be resolved in favor of the Settlement Agreement. The headings used in this Settlement Agreement are intended for the convenience of the reader only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Settlement Agreement.
21. No party or signatory shall be considered the drafter of this Settlement Agreement for the purpose of any statute, case law or rule of interpretation or construction that would or might cause any provision to be construed against the drafter.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Settling Parties, through their authorized representatives, have agreed and entered into this Settlement Agreement as of the date first written above.

Exhibit 99.1
MILWAUKEE, WI February 26, 2010/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton announced today that it has entered into a Stipulation of Settlement that, if given court approval, will resolve over 65 class-action lawsuits that have been filed against Briggs & Stratton and other engine and lawnmower manufacturers alleging, among other things, misleading power labeling on its lawnmower engines. As part of the settlement, Briggs & Stratton and the other settling defendants have agreed to establish a class wide cash settlement fund totaling $51 million, as well as certain injunctive relief concerning the power labeling of engines for the next ten years. In addition, Briggs & Stratton will offer a one year extension of its current warranty for all class members filing a claim. As part of the Stipulation, Briggs & Stratton has denied that it has done anything wrong and seeks a resolution to avoid further protracted and expensive litigation.
Briggs & Stratton is required to fund its portion of the cash settlement in conjunction with specified approval dates that are projected to occur at various times between the execution of the settlement agreement and June 2011. The Company expects to recognize a pretax expense of approximately $31 million ($19 million after tax) in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 to reflect the impact of the settlement. This settlement was not in the earnings guidance in the Company's January, 2010 earnings release.
The Stipulation, once approved, will resolve nationwide class-action litigation that first commenced in June 2004. Since that time, plaintiffs filed actions across the country, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, seeking to certify classes of all persons in each of the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. In these various actions, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs also filed state and federal antitrust and RICO claims and sought a nationwide class based on these claims.
The Stipulation of Settlement has been submitted to Judge Adelman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin for preliminary approval (In Re: Lawnmower Engine Horsepower Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation, Case No. 2:08-md-01999). If preliminary approval is granted, broader notice of the Stipulation of Settlement will be given and the parties of the Stipulation will seek to have the Stipulation finally approved.

MILWAUKEE, WI April 22, 2010/PR Newswire/-Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton today announced third quarter fiscal 2010 consolidated net income of $24.1 million or $0.48 per diluted share, that when adjusted for a litigation settlement of $30.6 million ($18.7 million after-tax) would result in an adjusted consolidated net income of $42.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share on consolidated net sales of $694.6 million. The litigation settlement relates to a class action lawsuit regarding horsepower labeling that was previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 2, 2010. The third quarter of fiscal 2009 had consolidated net income of $25.4 million or $0.51 per diluted share on consolidated net sales of $673.8 million. Consolidated net sales increased $20.8 million or 3% from the third quarter of the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in the Engines Segment. Third quarter adjusted consolidated net income increased $17.3 million from net income in the same period a year ago. Engines Segment operating results were the primary driver of the improved adjusted net income.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2010, consolidated net income was $18.4 million or $0.36 per diluted share, that when adjusted for the litigation settlement of $30.6 million ($18.7 million after-tax), would result in an adjusted consolidated net income of $37.1 million or $0.73 per diluted share on consolidated net sales of $1.412 billion. For the same period a year ago, consolidated net sales were $1.609 billion, and consolidated net income was $26.6 million or $0.53 per diluted share. The majority of the $197.0 million or 12% decrease in consolidated net sales was the result of lower sales volume in the Power Products Segment. The remainder of the net sales decrease reflects lower engine volume and lower prices. The nine-month adjusted consolidated net income increased by $10.5 million from net income in the same period a year ago. Engines Segment operating results were the primary driver of the improved adjusted net income.
Engines:
Third quarter net sales for fiscal 2010 were $498.9 million versus $480.2 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $18.7 million or 4%. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of an engine unit shipment increase of 6% from the same period a year ago. Offsetting the volume improvement were lower average prices in effect for fiscal 2010. Shipments of engines increased in the third quarter for lawn and garden applications due to the shift of OEM production to the last half of the fiscal year from the fiscal second quarter reflecting the desire of the channel participants to control their working capital commitments at the end of the calendar year.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 were $983.6 million versus $1.078 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $94.5 million or 9%. Unit volume decreases of 7% through nine months were the result of lower engine demand for portable generators, soft engine shipments to European lawn and garden equipment manufacturers and minor market share losses in various engine categories. The majority of the remainder of the net sales decrease was due to lower pricing implemented for fiscal 2010.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $43.8 million. Income from operations, after adjusting for the $30.6 million litigation settlement, was $74.4 million, a $27.8 million improvement from the $46.6 million reported for the same period in the prior year. The $27.8 million improvement was primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs for materials, labor and fixed overhead. Improvement in the adjusted income from operations from sales and manufacturing volume increases was offset by the previously discussed lower prices.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $56.0 million. Income from operations after adjusting for the litigation settlement was $86.6 million, a $23.5 million improvement from the $63.1 million reported for the same period a year ago. The $23.5 million improvement for the first nine months was the result of similar lower manufacturing costs as mentioned for the third fiscal quarter, offset by lower sales volume, production volume and pricing.
Power Products:
Fiscal 2010 third quarter net sales were $245.3 million versus $250.2 million for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $4.9 million. The net sales decrease was primarily the result of lower portable generator sales in the quarter, as the current year's quarter did not have hurricane replenishment shipments that were experienced in last year's third quarter. The portable generator sales decrease was partially offset by stronger pressure washer volume and a small improvement in shipments of lawn and garden equipment.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 were $565.5 million versus $697.7 million in the prior year, a $132.2 million decrease. Lower portable generator sales for this nine-month period accounted for almost all of the net sales decrease primarily due to the absence of any hurricane activity in fiscal 2010.
There was a loss from operations of $7.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, a $4.2 million greater loss than experienced in the prior year. The increase in the loss from operations resulted from lower plant utilization, primarily production of portable generators that decreased over 90% in the current third quarter compared to the same period a year ago.
The loss from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $8.0 million, a small improvement from the $8.9 million operating loss generated for the same period a year ago. The improvement in the loss from operations for the quarter was the result of lower manufacturing costs, primarily related to lower commodity costs and planned cost saving initiatives. The improvements were offset by lower sales and production volumes primarily related to the significantly lower portable generator shipments and production in fiscal 2010.
General:
Other income for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2010 was greater than the same periods last year primarily because of improved earnings in our joint ventures. Interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was less than the prior year because of lower borrowings offset by a premium expense of $1.4 million to repurchase a portion of outstanding senior notes during the quarter. Interest expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was also lower due to lower borrowings offset by a premium expense of $2.4 million to repurchase a portion of outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2010.
The effective tax rate was 27.1% for the third quarter and 22.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 versus 31.4% and 23.4% for the same periods last year, respectively. The variation reflected between years was due to the required recognition of the tax effect of certain events as discrete items in the quarter in which they occurred rather than in the overall expected annual tax rate.
The 8.875% Senior Notes that are due in March 2011 have been classified as a Current Maturity on Long-term Debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal March 2010. The company believes it will be able to replace these borrowings with new financing.
Outlook:
The company, after recognizing the litigation settlement in the third quarter, now projects that fiscal 2010 net income will be in the range of $24 to $31 million or $0.48 to $0.62 per diluted share. This current forecast range is the same as the forecast provided in January 2010, except it now incorporates the litigation settlement and the bottom end of the forecast has been increased. Consolidated net sales are projected to be approximately 6% lower between years primarily due to the absence of hurricane related sales of portable generators and their related engines, the continued impact of year over year pricing changes and lower engine shipments to Europe for lawn and garden applications. While the lawn and garden season has started, there remains uncertainty that the market growth built in to our projections should be changed at this time. Production levels for substantially all products are planned to be lower in fiscal 2010 to decrease our investment in working capital. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 2.8% to 3.1% after recognition of the litigation expense but still in the previously disclosed 4% to 5% range if the litigation expense is removed. Interest expense and other income are forecasted for the full year at $26 million and $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 27% to 30%.
The company will host a conference call today at 10:00 AM (EDT) to review this information. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on our corporate website: . Also available is a dial-in number to access the call real-time at (866) 281-6502. A replay will be offered beginning approximately two hours after the call ends and will be available for one week.

Investor Relations Contact:
David J. Rodgers, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
MILWAUKEE, WI, August 12, 2010/PR Newswire  Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 27, 2010.
Highlights:
 
 
 
 
"We continued to execute our operational initiatives to strengthen the company and improve profitability in fiscal 2010," commented Todd J. Teske, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. "Despite challenging economic conditions over the past year, operating profits and cash flows from operations increased and significantly improved our balance sheet. Our fiscal 2010 results position us to be successful for either a prolonged economic recovery in the US and Europe or a stronger rebound as consumer confidence returns. We are also pleased that our financial results allowed us to pay our employees the remainder of the salaries and 401(K) company match benefits that were reduced earlier in the fiscal year. The response of our employees to our business challenges during fiscal 2010 was extraordinary."
Consolidated Results:
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter results included consolidated net sales of $615.6 million and consolidated net income of $18.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 had consolidated net sales of $482.8 million and consolidated net income of $5.3 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Included in net income for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter was a $5.8 million pretax ($3.5 million after tax) expense associated with the closing of a manufacturing facility in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The consolidated net sales increase of $132.9 million or 27.5% was due primarily to increased shipment volumes in both the Engines and Power Products Segments. After considering the impact of the fiscal 2009 item related to the Jefferson, Wisconsin facility closure, fourth quarter consolidated net income was $18.2 million, which was higher by $9.4 million as compared to the prior year adjusted net income of $8.8 million. This increase was the result of increased shipment and production volumes as well as improved productivity, partially offset by the $4.4 million repayment to employees for the remainder of the salaries and 401(K) company match benefits that were reduced earlier in the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2010, the company had consolidated net sales of $2.03 billion and consolidated net income of $36.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 consolidated net sales were $2.09 billion and consolidated net income was $32.0 million or $0.64 per diluted share. The $64.3 million decrease in consolidated net sales was primarily due to reduced generator shipment volumes due to the absence of landed hurricanes. In addition, sales were also impacted by lower average prices for engines offset by a favorable mix of engines and favorable currency exchange primarily related to the Euro and Australian dollar.
Included in fiscal 2010 consolidated net income was a $30.6 million pretax expense ($18.7 million after tax or $0.37 per diluted share) associated with a class action lawsuit regarding horsepower labeling that was previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 2, 2010. Fiscal 2009 consolidated net income included the $5.8 million pretax ($3.5 million after tax) expense associated with the closing of the Jefferson, Wisconsin manufacturing facility. After considering the impact of these items, fiscal 2010 adjusted consolidated net income was $55.3 million, which was higher by $19.8 million compared to the prior year adjusted net income of $35.5 million. The increased net income was primarily the result of reduced manufacturing costs, lower commodity costs and transportation expenses and planned manufacturing cost savings.
Engines Segment:
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter net sales were $423.1 million versus $336.0 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of $87.1 million or 25.9%. The increase in net sales was the result of increased sales volume to U.S. OEM customers and a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected higher priced units used on riding lawn and garden equipment. Engine shipments were favorably impacted by the improvement in lawn and garden products sold at retail primarily due to favorable weather conditions domestically. Lower average sales prices and unfavorable exchange rates compared to last year partially offset the higher volumes and favorable product mix.
Net sales for fiscal 2010 were $1.40 billion versus the $1.41 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $7.4 million or 0.5%. Total engine volumes for the year were essentially flat as an increase in engines used in lawn and garden applications was offset by reduced demand for engines for portable generators due to no landed hurricane activity. Lower average prices during the year were effectively offset by a favorable mix of higher priced engines shipped for use on riding equipment and a slightly favorable foreign currency impact.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $27.2 million, up $6.8 million from the $20.4 million earned during the same period in the prior year. The increased income from operations was the result of increased sales and production volumes, lower commodity costs, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected higher priced units, and improved productivity, offset by lower average prices and increased engineering, selling and administrative expenses. Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were higher due in part to recognizing the expense for repayment of the remaining salaries and 401(K) company match benefits that were reduced from salaried employees earlier in the fiscal year.
Income from operations for fiscal 2010 was $83.1 million. Income from operations after adjusting for the $30.6 million litigation settlement was $113.7 million, up $30.3 million from the $83.4 million in fiscal 2009. The increased income from operations was the result of lower manufacturing costs and efficiencies, lower average commodity costs, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected higher priced units, and improved productivity, partially offset by lower average sales prices and higher selling and administrative expenses.
Power Products Segment:
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter net sales were $248.8 million versus $195.2 million from the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.6 million. The net sales increase was due to increased shipments of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers, both driven by favorable weather conditions domestically.
Net sales for fiscal 2010 were $814.3 million versus $892.9 million in the prior year, a $78.6 million decrease. The net sales decrease for the year was the result of decreased portable generator sales volume due to the absence of any landed hurricanes in fiscal 2010 partially offset by higher volumes of other power products.
The income from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $2.1 million. The loss from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $6.1 million, which included a $4.6 million impairment expense related to the write-down of assets associated with the closure of the Jefferson, Wisconsin facility. After considering the impact of the Jefferson closure, income from operations between years improved by $3.6 million. The improvement resulted from increased sales and production volumes of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers. Offsetting the improvement was a decrease in absorption rates due to lower production levels of portable generators and snow throwers compared to the prior year, as well as increased engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses related to the repayment to employees for the remainder of the salaries and 401(K) company match benefits that were reduced earlier in the fiscal year.
The loss from operations for fiscal 2010 was $5.9 million. The loss from operations for fiscal 2009 was $15.0 million, which included the $4.6 million expense related to the write-down of assets associated with the closure of the Jefferson, Wisconsin facility. After considering the impact of the Jefferson closure, the loss from operations between years was improved by approximately $4.5 million. The majority of the improvement was the result of lower manufacturing costs, primarily related to lower commodity costs and planned cost savings initiatives. The improvements were partially offset by lower sales and production volumes primarily related to the significantly lower portable generator production and shipments in fiscal 2010. Transition costs of approximately $8.0 million related to the closure of the Jefferson, Wisconsin facility more than offset the related cost savings of approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2010 associated with consolidating the manufacturing and administrative footprint accomplished in fiscal 2010.
Corporate Items:
Other income for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 was greater than the same periods last year primarily because of improved earnings of our joint ventures. Interest expense for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2010 was less than the comparable periods of last year due to lower average borrowings offset by a premium expense of $0.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, related to the repurchase of a portion of outstanding senior notes.
The effective tax rate was 28.2% and 5.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate was 25.4% and 20.9% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The variation between quarters is due to the required recognition of the tax effects of certain events as discrete items in the quarter they occur rather than in the overall expected annual tax rate. In addition, the annual fluctuation reflects the impact of changes in foreign earnings at different tax rates and the taxation of dividends from foreign operations as well as a larger benefit from the production activities deduction and resolution of certain tax matters.
Financial Position:
The 8.875% Senior Notes that are due in March 2011 have been classified as Short-Term Debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal 2010. The company believes it will be able to replace these borrowings with new financing at or prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes.
Net debt at June 27, 2010 was $89.9 million (total debt of $206.5 million less $116.6 million of cash), an improvement of $178.2 million from fiscal 2009. The reduction of debt was attributable to cash flows from operations. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $243.7 million during fiscal 2010, an increase of $71.3 million over fiscal 2009.
Outlook:
For fiscal 2011, the company projects that consolidated net income will be in the range of $60 million to $70 million or $1.20 to $1.40 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be higher by approximately 2% to 4% depending on the level of recovery of consumer spending within the outdoor power equipment category. Engines Segment sales are forecasted higher on modest volume and pricing improvements while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher volumes of lawn and garden equipment. Demand for portable generators and the related engines due to landed hurricane activity have not been included in our fiscal 2011 sales forecast. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $23 million to $25 million and $4 million to $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 32% to 35%.

Exhibit 99.1

David J. Rodgers, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer
(414) 259-5333
MILWAUKEE, WI, October 21, 2010/PR Newswire  Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended September 26, 2010.
Highlights:
 
 
 
"We are pleased with our fiscal 2011 first quarter results as we move forward executing our strategy despite continued economic uncertainty," commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. "We improved sales and operating results through a period of continued slow growth in consumer spending. Along with these improved operating results, our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to focus on efficiently managing our capital."
Consolidated Results:
Fiscal 2011 first quarter consolidated net sales were $334.1 million and the consolidated net loss was $8.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share. The first quarter of fiscal 2010 had consolidated net sales of $324.6 million and a consolidated net loss of $8.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share. The $9.5 million consolidated net sales increase was due primarily to increased international engine shipments as well as improved lawn and garden and snow thrower product sales volumes within our Power Products segment, offset by lower sales of pressure washers and portable generator products. The reduced net loss of $0.6 million compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter was primarily the result of increased engine sales to third party customers and improved engine plant productivity on higher production volumes, offset by Jefferson plant transition costs and lower production volumes in the Power Products segment and increased costs stemming from higher salaries and benefits expenses. The higher salaries and benefits expenses include a $3.0 million net increase in pension and other postretirement benefits as well as an increase in salaries and 401(k) company match benefits of $5.0 million, which have been fully restored since being temporarily reduced early in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Engines Segment:
Fiscal 2011 first quarter net sales were $205.0 million, which was $0.9 million or 0.4% less than the prior year. This decrease from the same quarter last year is primarily due to a reduction in intercompany sales of engines to our Power Products segment due to lower sales and production of pressure washers and portable generators, offset by an increase in international engine unit volumes to European and Asian OEMs.
The fiscal 2011 first quarter loss from operations was $5.5 million, which is $0.7 million more than the $4.9 million loss from operations experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This increase in the loss from operations over the prior year was the result of higher salaries and benefits expenses of $6.8 million, offset by improved absorption as engines produced increased 9% over the prior year first quarter. The increase in salaries and benefits is primarily attributed to temporary reductions in salaries and 401(k) match implemented in the first quarter last year; such salaries and benefits have since been restored resulting in the increase between years.
 
Power Products Segment:
Fiscal 2011 first quarter net sales were $168.2 million, which was $2.3 million or 1.4% greater than the prior year. The improvement in sales compared to the same quarter last year primarily resulted from increased unit shipment volumes of lawn and garden products, offset by reduced shipment volumes of pressure washers and portable generators as retailers reduce their inventories in these categories.
The fiscal 2011 first quarter loss from operations was $5.0 million, or $7.5 million lower than the income from operations of $2.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This decline in income from operations between years resulted from higher manufacturing spending including transition costs from the closure of our Jefferson manufacturing facility, lower absorption primarily related to the decreased production of portable generators and pressure washers, as well as increased expenses of $1.5 million related to salaries and benefits. The increase in salaries and benefits is primarily attributed to temporary reductions in salaries and 401(k) match implemented in the first quarter last year; such salaries and benefits have since been restored resulting in the increase between years. Higher manufacturing spending is attributed to higher material costs and increased freight expense.
Corporate Items:
Interest expense was lower between years because of lower outstanding borrowings. The effective tax rate for the fiscal 2011 first quarter was a benefit of 33.4%, or $4.1 million, versus a benefit of 36.1%, or $4.9 million, in the first quarter last year. The effective tax rate benefit for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was lower than the 2010 period because 2010 included the favorable tax impact of the settlement of audits.
Financial Position:
The 8.875% Senior Notes that are due in March 2011 are classified as Short-Term Debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal 2011 first quarter. The company believes it will be able to replace these borrowings with new financing at or prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes. In the unlikely event the company is unable to replace these borrowings with new financing upon the maturity of the Senior Notes, we believe that the availability within our existing revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay off the outstanding Senior Notes.
Net debt at September 26, 2010 was $156.4 million (total debt of $204.1 million less $47.7 million of cash), an improvement of $106.5 million from September 27, 2009. Cash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal 2011 first quarter were $55.5 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $11.9 million in the fiscal 2010 first quarter. The increase in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to working capital requirements to replenish inventory from lower levels at the end of fiscal 2010.
Outlook:
The company continues to project that fiscal 2011 net income will be in the range of $60 to $70 million or $1.20 to $1.40 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be approximately 2% to 4% higher than in fiscal 2010. Engines Segment sales are forecasted higher on modest volume and pricing improvements while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher expected volumes of lawn and garden equipment. Demand for portable generators and the related engines due to landed hurricane activity have not been included in our fiscal 2011 sales forecast. Operating income margins for fiscal 2011 are projected to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $23 million to $25 million and $4 million to $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 32% to 35%.

ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
Briggs & Stratton Corporation announced that it has recently made organizational changes that have resulted in a reduction of several employees from its salaried workforce. The headcount reductions were primarily at the corporate headquarters. The Company expects to take a pre-tax charge of $4.0 to $5.0 million, or $0.05 to $0.07 per diluted share after taxes, during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 for severance costs related to the staffing reductions. As a result, on November 9, 2010, the Company revised its diluted earnings per share estimate for fiscal 2011 to be in a range of $1.13 to $1.35.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or the other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.

(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or disbursements reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor.

If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9, Section 13 and Section 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.

Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or the Guarantor to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representative and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or (b) any Underwriter to the Company.

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantees") by the Guarantors.
As counsel to the Company in connection with the proposed issue and sale of the Notes, we have examined: (a) the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus and the exhibits (including those incorporated by reference) constituting a part of the Registration Statement; (b) the form of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture; (c) the form of the Notes and the Guarantees; and (d) such other proceedings, documents and records as we have deemed necessary to enable us to render this opinion.
In our examination of the above-referenced documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
Based upon the foregoing, assuming that the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, in the form examined by us, (a) will have been executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor and (b) will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represent the valid and binding obligations of, the Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:

The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
If a Person whose signature is on a Security occupied a particular office at the time of such execution but no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.02, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.01, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(3) that this Indenture constituted, and such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute, valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not unsatisfactory to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.01 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of any series are not to be originally issued at one time, unless otherwise requested by the Trustee, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.12, and shall provide with Trustee with an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.01.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser in whose hands such Security is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.
If the Paying Agent holds, in its capacity as such, on any Maturity Date, money sufficient to pay all accrued interest and principal with respect to the Securities payable on that date and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders thereof pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.

and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor.

MILWAUKEE, January 27, 2011/PRNewswire/ 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter and first six months ended December 26, 2010.
Highlights:
 
 
 
"Our second quarter results yielded sales growth for both our Engine and Power Products Segments," commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. "While we continue to work towards our strategic plans, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing throughout the company despite continuingly challenging economic times. Our organization changes announced earlier this fiscal year demonstrate our commitment to improving the profitability of our Power Products business while making investments for long-term success. Further, the recent refinancing of our Senior Notes extends our maturity profile and enhances our liquidity during a favorable interest rate environment."
Consolidated Results:
Fiscal 2011 second quarter consolidated net sales were $450.3 million and the consolidated net loss was $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2010 had consolidated net sales of $393.0 million and consolidated net income of $3.0 million or $0.06 per diluted share. The $57.3 million consolidated net sales increase was due primarily to higher international engine shipments as well as improved lawn and garden and snow thrower product sales volumes within our Power Products segment, offset by lower sales of portable generator products.
Included in the net loss for the fiscal 2011 second quarter was a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to previously announced organization changes and $3.9 million of additional pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the redemption premium of the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write off of the related deferred financing costs. After considering the impact of items related to the organization changes and the debt redemption, adjusted net income for the fiscal 2011 second quarter was $3.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share, which was higher by $0.3 million or less than $0.01 per diluted share compared to the prior year second quarter net income of $3.0 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes and slightly increased engine pricing, partially offset by higher manufacturing spending, lower absorption on decreased production of portable generators and higher salaries and benefits expenses.
For the first six months of fiscal 2011, consolidated net sales were $784.4 million and the consolidated net loss was $9.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share. The first six months of fiscal 2010 had consolidated net sales of $717.7
million and a consolidated net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. The $66.8 million consolidated net sales increase was due primarily to higher international engine shipments as well as improved lawn and garden and snow thrower product sales volumes within our Power Products segment, offset by lower sales of pressure washers and portable generator products.
After considering the impact of the second quarter fiscal 2011 charges related to the organization changes and the debt redemption, the adjusted net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $4.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which was an improvement of $0.9 million or $0.02 per diluted share as compared to the prior year net loss of $5.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share. This improvement was primarily due to increased shipment volumes, improved engine plant productivity on higher production volumes and slightly increased engine pricing, partially offset by higher manufacturing spending, lower absorption primarily related to the decreased production of portable generators and pressure washers, and increased costs stemming from higher salaries and benefits expenses. The higher salaries and benefits expenses include an $8.4 million increase in pension benefits expense as well as a net increase in salaries and 401(k) company match benefits of $5.1 million, which were temporarily reduced in the first six months of fiscal 2010 and have since been fully restored.
Engines Segment:
Fiscal 2011 second quarter net sales were $297.8 million, which was $37.8 million or 14.5% higher than the prior year period. This increase from the same quarter last year is primarily due to higher international engine unit shipments to European and Asian OEMs, partially offset by slightly lower sales domestically as U.S. OEMs and retailers continue to focus on lean inventory levels prior to the spring selling season.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2011 were $503.4 million, which was $37.4 million or 8.0% higher than the prior year period. This increase from the same period last year is primarily due to higher international engine unit shipments to European and Asian OEMs, partially offset by lower engine sales domestically and a reduction of intercompany sales of engines to our Power Products segment due to lower sales and production of pressure washers and portable generators.
The fiscal 2011 second quarter income from operations was $20.2 million, which included a $0.6 million pre-tax charge related to the previously discussed organization changes. After considering the impact of the organization changes, adjusted income from operations was $20.7 million, or $3.8 million higher than the income from operations of $16.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Adjusted income from operations was higher due to increased shipment volumes, offset by higher materials costs, increased salaries and benefits including a $4.0 million increase in pension benefits expense and higher selling expenses driven by increased sales internationally.
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $14.8 million. After considering the impact of the previously discussed organization changes, adjusted income from operations was $15.4 million, or $3.3 million higher than the income from operations of $12.1 million for the same period one year ago. This improvement in adjusted income from operations was due to increased shipment volumes and improvements to production efficiency, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits and higher selling expenses driven by increased sales internationally. The increase in salaries and benefits includes a $8.4 million increase in pension benefits expense and $3.6 million attributed to temporary reductions in salaries and 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
Power Products Segment:
Fiscal 2011 second quarter net sales were $186.4 million, which was $21.5 million or 13.0% greater than the prior year period. This improvement was due primarily to increased unit shipment volumes of snow throwers, ZTRs and pressure washers, offset by reduced shipment volumes of portable generators as a result of lower consumer demand and adequate channel inventories.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2011 were $353.9 million, which was $23.2 million or 7.0% greater than the prior year period. This improvement was due primarily to increased unit production volumes of snow throwers and ZTRs, offset by reduced shipment volumes of pressure washers and portable generators as a result of lower consumer demand and retailers closely managing inventories in these categories.
The fiscal 2011 second quarter loss from operations was $14.1 million, which included a $3.0 million pre-tax charge related to the previously discussed organization changes. After considering the impact of the organization
changes, the adjusted loss from operations was $11.1 million, or $7.3 million higher than the loss from operations of $3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The increased adjusted loss from operations between years was due to higher manufacturing spending and lower absorption primarily related to the decreased production of portable generators and pressure washers partially offset by increased shipment volumes of snow throwers and ZTRs. The higher manufacturing spending is attributed to higher material costs, manufacturing inefficiencies in launching new products, increased warranty expense, and increased freight expense.
The loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $19.3 million, which included the $3.0 million pre-tax charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to the previously discussed organization changes. After considering the impact of the organization changes, the adjusted loss from operations was $16.3 million, or $14.9 million higher than the loss from operations of $1.4 million for the same period one year ago. This decline in income from operations between years resulted from higher manufacturing spending, lower absorption primarily related to the decreased production of portable generators and pressure washers, as well as increased expenses related to salaries and benefits. The increase in manufacturing spending relates to transition costs from the closure of our Jefferson manufacturing facility, higher material costs, manufacturing inefficiencies in launching new products, increased warranty expense, and increased freight expense. The increase in salaries and benefits includes $1.4 million attributable to temporary reductions in salaries and the 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
Corporate Items:
In December 2010, the company issued $225 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due December 2020. Net proceeds were primarily used to redeem the remaining outstanding principal of the 8.875% Senior Notes due March 2011.
Interest expense was higher for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2011 due to a $3.9 million redemption premium on the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write off of related deferred financing costs, offset by lower average outstanding borrowings.
The second quarter and first six months effective tax rate benefit for fiscal 2011 was 65.3% and 40.7%, respectively, versus the 29.1% effective tax rate and 39.2% effective tax rate benefit in the same respective periods last year. The increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 effective tax rate benefit over the prior year was the result of recognizing the benefit of the research & development credit, which was extended by federal tax legislature enacted on December 17, 2010.
Financial Position:
Net debt at December 26, 2010 was $251.5 million (total debt of $283.0 million less $31.5 million of cash), an improvement of $62.9 million from December 27, 2009. Cash flows used by operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2011 were $128.7 million, or $103.4 million higher compared to $25.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to working capital requirements to replenish inventory from lower levels at the end of fiscal 2010 and due to timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
:
Outlook
The company maintains its revised guidance that fiscal 2011 net income on a GAAP basis will be in the range of $57 to $68 million or $1.13 to $1.35 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be approximately 2% to 4% higher than in fiscal 2010. Engines Segment sales are forecasted higher on modest volume and pricing improvements while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher expected volumes of lawn and garden equipment. Demand for portable generators and the related engines due to landed hurricane activity have not been included in our fiscal 2011 sales forecast. Operating income margins for fiscal 2011 are projected to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $23 million to $24 million and $4 million to $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 32% to 35%.

MILWAUKEE, April 28, 2011/PRNewswire/ 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter and first nine months ended March 27, 2011.
Highlights:
 
 
 
"Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were driven by sales and operating improvements within both of our Engines and Power Products Segments," commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. "We are very pleased with the strong sales growth we have achieved in our international markets this year. It is one of many outcomes demonstrating our team's focus on delivering results against the core pillars of our strategy. We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the upcoming lawn and garden season here in the U.S. despite the on-going economic challenges and the impact of higher gasoline prices on consumer spending."
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $720.3 million, an increase of $25.8 million or 3.7% when compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal 2011 third quarter consolidated net income was $51.5 million or $1.02 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2010 consolidated net income was $24.1 million or $0.48 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the fiscal 2010 third quarter was a litigation settlement of $30.6 million ($18.7 million after-tax or $0.37 per diluted share). After considering the impact of the litigation settlement, third quarter fiscal 2011 consolidated net income improved by $8.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share over the adjusted consolidated net income of $42.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were $1.5 billion, an increase of $92.5 million or 6.6% when compared to the same period a year ago. For the first nine months of fiscal 2011, consolidated net income was $42.2 million or $0.84 per diluted share. The first nine months of fiscal 2010 consolidated net income was $18.4 million or $0.36 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to previously announced organization changes and $3.9 million of additional pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the redemption premium of the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs. Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was a litigation settlement of $30.6 million ($18.7
million after-tax or $0.37 per diluted share). After considering the impact of items related to the organization changes, debt redemption and litigation settlement, adjusted consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $46.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share, which was higher by $9.6 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2010 adjusted consolidated net income of $37.1 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2011 third quarter net sales were $503.8 million, which was $20.8 million or 4.3% higher than the prior year period. This increase from the same quarter last year is primarily due to higher shipment volumes and slightly increased engine pricing, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of product shipped that reflected lower volumes of units used on riding lawn and garden equipment.
The Engines Segment gross profit percentage was 24.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, or slightly lower from 24.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The change was attributable to higher commodity costs and increased salaries and benefits including a $2.3 million increase in pension benefits expense, offset by slightly increased engine pricing.
The Engines Segment fiscal 2011 third quarter income from operations was $77.5 million, an increase of $3.5 million from fiscal 2010 third quarter adjusted income from operations. The increase is due to the improvement in net sales partially offset by an increase in non-manufacturing salaries and benefits including a $1.9 million increase in pension benefits expense.
Engines Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were approximately $1.0 billion, which was $58.2 million or 6.1% higher than the prior year period. This increase from the same period last year is primarily due to higher international engine unit shipments to European and Asian OEMs as well as slightly increased engine pricing.
The Engines Segment gross profit percentage increased to 23.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 from 22.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. This improvement was primarily due to increased production volumes and slightly increased engine pricing partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased salaries and benefits. The increase in salaries and benefits includes a $7.2 million increase in pension benefits expense and $2.2 million of higher salaries and benefits due to temporary reductions in salaries and the 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
The Engines Segment adjusted income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $92.9 million, an increase of $6.8 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2010 adjusted income from operations. The increase is due to the improvement in net sales and the gross profit percentage offset by an increase in non-manufacturing salaries and benefits including a $5.4 million increase in pension benefits expense and $1.5 million higher expenses due to temporary reductions in salaries and the 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
Power Products Segment:
Power Products Segment fiscal 2011 third quarter net sales were $267.5 million, which was $12.1 million or 4.8% greater than the prior year period. This improvement was due primarily to increased unit shipment volumes of snow throwers and ZTRs, partially offset by reduced shipment volumes of portable generators as a result of fewer wide spread power outages caused by ice storms.
The Power Products Segment gross profit percentage increased to 9.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from 7.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The improvement over the prior year was attributable to increased sales of higher margin products to dealers, decreased manufacturing spending and increased absorption on higher production volumes, partially offset by higher commodity costs and warranty expense. The decrease in manufacturing spending includes the absence of $3.0 million of transition costs from the closure of our Jefferson manufacturing facility, which were incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
The Power Products Segment fiscal 2011 third quarter income from operations was $1.7 million, an increase of $8.9 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Power Products Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were $621.5 million, which was $35.4 million or 6.0% greater than the prior year period. This improvement was due primarily to increased unit shipment volumes of snow throwers and ZTRs, partially offset by reduced shipment volumes of pressure washers and portable generators as a result of lower consumer demand and retailers and dealers closely managing inventories in these categories.
The Power Products Segment gross profit percentage decreased to 8.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 from 9.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. This decline between years resulted from higher manufacturing spending, lower absorption primarily related to the decreased production of portable generators, as well as increased expenses related to salaries and benefits. The increase in manufacturing spending relates to higher commodity costs, manufacturing inefficiencies in launching new products, increased warranty expense, and increased freight expense. The increase in salaries and benefits includes $0.8 million higher expenses attributable to temporary reductions in salaries and the 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
The Power Products Segment adjusted loss from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $14.6 million, or $5.9 million higher than the loss from operations of $8.6 million for the same period one year ago. The increased loss from operations was primarily caused by the previously discussed manufacturing cost increases as well as an increase in non-manufacturing salaries and benefits including $0.6 million higher expenses attributable to temporary reductions in salaries and the 401(k) match implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
Corporate Items:
As previously announced, in December 2010 the company issued $225 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due December 2020. Net proceeds were primarily used to redeem the remaining outstanding principal of the 8.875% Senior Notes due March 2011.
Interest expense was lower for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 due to lower average outstanding borrowings as well as the reduced interest rate associated with the refinanced Senior Notes. Interest expense was lower for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 due to lower average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by $3.9 million of pre-tax charges related to the redemption premium on the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of related deferred financing costs.
The third quarter and first nine months effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 32.4% and 30.3%, respectively, versus 27.1% and 22.3% effective tax rate in the same respective periods last year. The variation reflected between years was due to the required recognition of the tax effect of certain events as discrete items in the quarter in which they occurred rather than in the overall expected annual tax rate.
Financial Position:
Net debt at March 27, 2011 was $240.2 million (total debt of $283.0 million less $42.8 million of cash), an improvement of $80.4 million from the $320.6 million (total debt of $348.5 million less $27.9 million of cash) at March 28, 2010. Cash used by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $100.3 million, or $83.8 million higher compared to $16.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to working capital requirements to replenish inventory from lower levels at the end of fiscal 2010 and due to timing of payments associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by higher net income.
:
Outlook
The company maintains its guidance that fiscal 2011 net income on a GAAP basis will be in the range of $57 to $68 million or $1.13 to $1.35 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales are projected to be approximately 2% to 5% higher than in fiscal 2010. Engines Segment sales are forecasted higher on modest volume and pricing improvements while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher expected volumes of lawn and garden equipment. Demand for portable generators and the related engines due to landed hurricane activity have not been included in our fiscal 2011 sales forecast. Operating income margins for fiscal 2011 are projected to be in the range of 4.7% to 5.2%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $23 million to $24 million and $6 million to $7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 30% to 33%.

MILWAUKEE, August 11, 2011/PRNewswire/ 
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended July 3, 2011.
Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased with our fiscal 2011 results when considering the significant challenges that have confronted the U.S. lawn and garden market," commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. "Sales growth in our international markets continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This diversification of our customer base helped us deliver 14.4% growth in adjusted consolidated net income in a year that the North American consumer lawn and garden market has declined double-digits." Teske continued, "The Board's authorization of a $50 million share repurchase program reflects continued confidence in our strategy, the long-term prospects of the business and our commitment to increase shareholder value. Our business continues to generate healthy cash flow, which allows us to opportunistically repurchase common shares while maintaining the flexibility to make strategic investments as we grow our business."
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $605.2 million, a decrease of $10.4 million or 1.7% when compared to the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2011 fourth quarter consolidated net loss was $17.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 consolidated net income was $18.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was a $49.5 million non-cash pre-tax charge associated with the impairment of Power Products segment goodwill ($34.3 million after tax or $0.68 per diluted share). After considering the impact of the non-cash goodwill impairment, adjusted consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $16.5 million or $0.32 per diluted share, which was lower by $1.7 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to fiscal 2010 consolidated net income of $18.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share. The impairment charge is a non-cash expense that did not adversely affect the company's debt position, cash flow, liquidity or compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities. No impairment charges were recorded within the Engines segment.
Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 were $2.1 billion, an increase of $82.1 million or 4.0% when compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal 2011 consolidated net income was $24.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Fiscal 2010 consolidated net income was $36.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for fiscal 2011 was the aforementioned $49.5 million non-cash pre-tax charge associated with the impairment of Power Products segment goodwill ($34.3 million after tax or $0.68 per diluted share), a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to previously announced organization changes and $3.9 million of additional pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the redemption premium of the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs. Included in consolidated net income for fiscal 2010 was a litigation settlement of $30.6 million ($18.7 million after-tax or $0.37 per diluted share). After considering the impact of items related to the goodwill impairment, organization changes, debt redemption and litigation settlement, adjusted consolidated net income for fiscal 2011 was $63.2 million or $1.25 per diluted share, which was higher by $8.0 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to fiscal 2010 adjusted consolidated net income of $55.3 million or $1.10 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
 
Engines Segment fiscal 2011 fourth quarter net sales were $392.3 million, which was $19.2 million or 4.7% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was driven by approximately 13% lower shipment volumes compared to last year, due to lower sales to domestic OEMs as a result of unfavorable weather conditions in North America that have hampered the lawn and garden selling season, offset by improved engine pricing, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on commercial and riding lawn and garden equipment, and the favorable impact of foreign currency.
The Engines Segment gross profit was $84.0 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a decrease of $3.9 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower net sales, higher commodity costs and increased manufacturing wages and benefits including a $2.3 million increase in pension benefits expense, partially offset by lower manufacturing spending, improved absorption on 7.0% higher volume of units produced, improved engine pricing and a $2.7 million foreign currency benefit.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $55.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a decrease of $3.9 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This reduction was primarily due to lower salaries expense partially offset by an increase in pension benefits expense of $1.9 million. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter salaries expense included $1.5 million related to the restoration of temporary reductions in salaries and 401(k) match that were implemented in the first half of fiscal 2010.
Engines Segment net sales for fiscal 2011 were approximately $1.4 billion, which was $39.1 million or 2.9% higher than the same period a year ago despite a 2.1% decline in total unit shipment volumes. This increase from the same period last year was primarily due to higher international engine unit shipments, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionately larger volumes of units used on commercial applications, improved engine pricing and a $4.7 million foreign currency benefit, partially offset by reduced engine shipments primarily to customers in North America.
The Engines Segment gross profit was $319.6 million for fiscal 2011, an improvement of $19.3 million compared to fiscal 2010. This improvement was due to higher net sales, a favorable mix of products shipped, improved engine pricing, increased manufacturing efficiencies, a $5.4 million foreign currency benefit and increased absorption on 4.0% higher production volumes, partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased manufacturing wages and benefits, including a $9.6 million increase in pension benefits expense.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $199.2 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of $13.1 million from fiscal 2010. The increase was due to higher international selling expenses and increased salaries and benefits, which include a $7.2 million increase in pension benefits expense.
Power Products Segment:
 
Power Products Segment fiscal 2011 fourth quarter net sales were $257.5 million, consistent with net sales of the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter results were primarily impacted by increased sales in our Australian and European markets as well as a $2.6 million foreign currency benefit. In the North American market, reduced shipment volumes of pressure washers and lawn and garden equipment were partially offset by increased shipments of portable generators. Sales of portable generators were favorably impacted by storm activity in the southern U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2011.
The Power Products Segment gross profit was $22.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a decrease of $6.6 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The decrease over the prior year was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing spending and increased sales allowances offered to our customers, partially offset by a favorable mix of unit shipments of premium dealer lawn and garden products and a $2.2 million foreign currency benefit. The increased manufacturing spending was associated with rising commodity costs, increased warranty expense and increased freight expense.
The Power Products Segment fiscal 2011 fourth quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses of $28.7 million increased by $0.8 million from the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter primarily due to higher international selling expenses.
Power Products Segment net sales for fiscal 2011 were $879.0 million, which was $35.3 million or 4.2% higher than the same period a year ago. This improvement was primarily due to increased sales in our Australian and European markets, partially offset by reduced unit shipment volumes of lawn and garden equipment, pressure washers and portable generators in the domestic market.
The Power Products Segment gross profit was $77.4 million for fiscal 2011, a decline of $9.0 million compared to fiscal 2010. The decline between years resulted from higher manufacturing spending and budget conscious customers purchasing lower margin units, partially offset by increased sales of premium dealer lawn and garden products, slightly increased pricing, and a $7.2 million foreign currency benefit. The increase in manufacturing spending relates to higher commodity costs, manufacturing inefficiencies in the first half of the fiscal year in launching new products and increased warranty, and increased freight expenses, partially offset by $8.0 million in incremental cost savings associated with the closure of our Jefferson, Wisconsin manufacturing facility in fiscal 2010.
The Power Products Segment fiscal 2011 engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses of $101.5 million increased by $7.3 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to increased international selling expenses, $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency and previously announced organization change costs of $3.0 million.
Corporate Items:
As previously announced, in December 2010 the company issued $225 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due December 2020. Net proceeds were primarily used to redeem the remaining outstanding principal of the 8.875% Senior Notes due March 2011.
Interest expense was lower for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and the reduced interest rate associated with the refinanced Senior Notes. Interest expense was lower for fiscal 2011 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and the reduced interest rate associated with the refinanced notes, partially offset by $3.9 million of pre-tax charges related to the redemption premium on the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of related deferred financing costs.
The effective tax rate was 37.3% and 28.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate was 24.0% and 25.4% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The current year income tax benefit includes $15.1 million of income tax benefit related to the $49.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Approximately $10.6 million of the goodwill impairment was related to non-deductible goodwill associated with past stock acquisitions for which a tax benefit was not recorded. The remaining goodwill impairment generated the $15.1 million of tax benefit. Due to the significant impact the impairment charge had on the effective tax rate, the Company believes the tax benefit and the effective tax rate excluding the $49.5 million impairment charge are more meaningful comparisons to last year's comparable period. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 21.5% and 28.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate was 28.0% and 25.4% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The quarterly and annual fluctuations reflect the impact of changes in foreign earnings at different tax rates, the taxation of dividends from foreign operations as well as the resolution of certain tax matters.
Financial Position:
Net debt at July 3, 2011 was $18.4 million (total debt of $228.0 million less $209.6 million of cash), an improvement of $71.5 million from the $89.9 million (total debt of $206.5 million less $116.6 million of cash) at June 27, 2010. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 was $163.7 million, or $80.0 million lower compared to $243.7 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to working capital requirements to replenish inventory from lower levels at the end of fiscal 2010 and due to timing of payments associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Share Repurchase Program:
The Board of Directors of the company has authorized up to $50 million in funds for a common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. Share repurchases, among other things, allow the company to offset any potentially dilutive impacts of stock-based compensation. The company will repurchase shares of common stock, using available cash, on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants.
Outlook:
For fiscal 2012, the company projects that consolidated net income will be in the range of $53 million to $63 million or $1.05 to $1.25 per diluted share prior to the impact of any potential share repurchases. Consolidated net sales are projected to be higher by approximately 2% to 4% depending on the level of recovery of consumer spending within the outdoor power equipment category. Engines Segment sales are forecasted to be comparable to fiscal 2011 on lower volume and improved pricing while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher volumes of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers. Demand for portable generators and the related engines due to landed hurricane activity have not been included in our fiscal 2012 sales forecast. Operating income margins are projected to be in the range of 4.3% to 4.8%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $18 million to $19 million and $5 million to $6 million, respectively. The operating earnings forecast includes additional investments of approximately $12 million for continued international growth. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 32% to 34%. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be approximately $60 million to $65 million.

ITEM 1.01.
    
ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL AGREEMENT
On October 13, 2011, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the Company) and Briggs & Stratton AG (B&S AG), as borrowers, entered into a $500 million multicurrency credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with various financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement replaces that certain amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement among the Company, various financial institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, dated as of July 12, 2007. The Company intends to use the new revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that matures on October 13, 2016. The initial maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is $500 million, of which, other than the outstanding letters of credit discussed in the following sentence, nothing was drawn as of October 13, 2011. Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit, of which approximately $6.8 million were outstanding as of October 13, 2011. The Company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility by up to $250 million if certain conditions are satisfied, including (i) the absence of any event of default or default under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) the Company obtaining the consent of the lenders participating in each such increase.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin based upon the Company's average net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the Average Net Leverage Ratio), or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin based upon the Company's Average Net Leverage Ratio. The Company must also pay (1) a commitment fee ranging from 20.0 to 40.0 basis points per annum (based upon the Company's Average Net Leverage Ratio) on the aggregate unused commitments, and (2) a letter of credit fee ranging from 62.5 to 225.0 basis points per annum (based upon the Company's Average Net Leverage Ratio) on the undrawn amount of letters of credit.
The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and, with certain exceptions, its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, the Company may not permit (i) the ratio of average funded debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Company to consolidated net income (excluding certain non-cash extraordinary and other gains) before, among other things, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other losses, expenses and charges (EBITDA) for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and (ii) the ratio of its EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to its consolidated interest expense, including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations (if any), for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
Except for customary provisions relating to the cash collateralization of letters of credit in limited circumstances, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. However, certain subsidiaries of the Company will unconditionally guarantee the Company's obligations from time to time arising under the Credit Agreement, and the Company will and, subject to certain conditions, certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company may in the future, unconditionally guarantee the obligations of B&S AG under the Credit Agreement to the extent that B&S AG borrows directly under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Company or B&S AG, while it remains a borrower under the Credit Agreement, becomes the subject of voluntary or
BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.
The description of the Credit Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Multicurrency Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

The Swing Line Subfacility
.
(a)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans in Dollars, Euros, Swiss francs or British pounds (each a 
Swing Line Loan
) to each Borrower from time to time on any Business Day prior to the Credit Termination Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of Revolving Loans and the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Commitment;
provided
that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment, and provided that the applicable Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this
Section 2.06
, prepay under
Section 2.08
, and reborrow under this
Section 2.06
. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
(b)
    
Each Swing Line Loan shall be made upon the applicable Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date for Swing Line Loans to be made to the Company in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m. London time one Business Day before the requested borrowing date for Swing Line Loans to be made in Swiss francs and not later than 11:00 a.m. London time on the requested borrowing date for any other Swing Line Loans, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be the Dollar Equivalent amount of $100,000 or a higher integral multiple of 100,000 units of the Applicable Currency, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such notice must be made by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent via facsimile or email of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Loan (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of
subsection 2.06(a)
, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Article V
is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the applicable Borrower at its office by crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.
(c)
    
The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing
30
Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of
Section 2.03
, without regard to the Minimum Tranche requirements, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitment Amount and the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish such Borrower with a copy of the applicable Notice of Borrowing promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Notice of Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Payment Office not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Notice of Borrowing, whereupon, subject to
subsection 2.06(c)(ii)
, each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made (A) in the case of Dollars, a Base Rate Loan to such Borrower in such amount and (B) in the case of Euros, British pounds or Swiss francs, a loan bearing interest at the Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.
(i)
    
If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by a Borrowing in accordance with
subsection 2.06(c)(i)
, the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to
subsection 2.06(c)(i)
shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
(ii)
    
If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
subsection 2.06(c)
by the time specified in
subsection 2.04(c)(i)
, the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (iii)
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(iii)
    
Each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this
subsection 2.06(c)
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this
subsection 2.06(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
31
(d)
    
At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
(i)
    
If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 12.06
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.
(e)
    
The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this
Section 2.06
to refinance such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.
(f)
    
The applicable Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.

Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.
35
(b)
    
Each determination of an interest rate or a Dollar Equivalent amount by the Administrative Agent shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence thereof in the absence of manifest error.

2.14
    
Payments by a Borrower
.
(a)
    
All payments to be made by a Borrower hereunder shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by a Borrower shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the Payment Office, and, with respect to principal of, interest on, and any other amounts relating to, any Offshore Currency Loan, shall be made in the Offshore Currency in which such Loan is denominated or payable, and, with respect to all other amounts payable hereunder, shall be made in Dollars. Such payments shall be made in Same Day Funds, and (i) in the case of Offshore Currency payments, no later than such time on the dates specified herein as may be determined by the Administrative Agent to be necessary for such payment to be credited on such date in accordance with normal banking procedures in the place of payment, (ii) in the case of any payment with respect to Swing Line Loans, no later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified herein, and (iii) in the case of any other Dollar payment, no later than 12:00 noon on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such principal, interest, fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment which is received by the Administrative Agent later than 12:00 noon, or later than the time specified by the Administrative Agent as provided in
clause (i)
above (in the case of Offshore Currency payments), shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
(b)
    
Whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be.
(c)
    
Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that such Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date in Same Day Funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower has not made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate or, in the case of a payment in an Offshore Currency, the Overnight Rate, for each day from the date such amount was distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.
2.15
    
Payments by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent
.
 
36
(a)
    
Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Borrower the amount of that Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds on the Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to such Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to such Borrower such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate or, in the case of any Borrowing consisting of Offshore Currency Loans, the Overnight Rate, for each day during such period. A notice from the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this
subsection 2.15(a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lenders Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent will notify the applicable Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agents account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising such Borrowing.
(b)
    
The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan on any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a Revolving Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such other Lender on any Borrowing Date.
2.16
    
Sharing of Payments, Etc.
If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of its Revolving Loans or its participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share (or other share contemplated hereunder) of payments to all Lenders on account of all Revolving Loans, L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations (or subparticipations) in the Revolving Loans and the L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment pro rata with each of them;
provided
that if any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or subparticipation) from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by
37
law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to
Section 12.10
) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations (and subparticipations) purchased under this
Section 2.16
and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.
2.17
    
Optional Increase in Aggregate Commitment Amount
. The Company may, from time to time, by means of a letter delivered to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form of
Exhibit H
, request that the Aggregate Commitment Amount be increased by (a) increasing the amount of the Commitment of one or more Lenders that have agreed (in their sole discretion) to such increase and/or (b) adding one or more commercial banks or other Persons as parties hereto (each an 
Additional Lender

provided
that (i) any such increase shall be in an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000; (ii) the aggregate amount of all such increases during the term of this Agreement shall not exceed $250,000,000; (iii) no Additional Lender shall be added as a party hereto without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld); and (iv) the Company may not request such an increase unless the Company has delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate stating that (x) the representations and warranties contained in
Article VI
are correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such certificate as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date) and (y) no Default or Event of Default exists on such date. Any increase in the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.17
shall be effective three Business Days after the date on which the Administrative Agent has received and accepted the applicable increase letter in the form of
Annex 1
to
Exhibit H
(in the case of an increase in the amount of the Commitment of an existing Lender) or assumption letter in the form of
Annex 2
to
Exhibit H
(in the case of the addition of a commercial bank or other Person as a new Lender) or, in each case, such other period of time as may be agreed among the Company, the increasing and/or new Lenders and the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.17
and of the amount of the Commitment and the Pro Rata Share of each Lender after giving effect thereto. If any increase in the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.17
is not ratable among the Lenders, then the Borrowers shall prepay all Revolving Loans outstanding on the date of such increase (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 4.04
) to the extent necessary to cause the outstanding Revolving Loans to be ratable among the Lenders in accordance with their revised Pro Rata Shares.
2.18

Section 12.10
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:

, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lenders or Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
seventh
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to a Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
eighth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to
Section 2.18(a)(iv)
. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this
Section 2.18(a)(ii)

(iii)    
Certain Fees
. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and neither Borrower shall be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
39
(B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to
Section 3.09
.
(C)    With respect to any L/C Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv)    
Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure
. Such Defaulting Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment), but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time) and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Loans of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
(v)    
Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans
. If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3.09
.
(b)    
Defaulting Lender Cure
. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Lenders and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the
40
Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to
Section 2.18(a)(iv)
), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided
,
further
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
(c)    
New Swing Line Loans/Letters of Credit
. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loans unless it is reasonably satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
(d)    
Notice of Defaulting Lenders

. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary:
(a)
    
The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly forward such notice to all Lenders) make an offer (a 
Loan Modification Offer
) to the Lenders to make one or more amendments or modifications to allow the Credit Termination Date and the Maturity Date (for purposes of this
Section 2.19
, the 
Scheduled Termination Dates
) for the Accepting Lenders (as defined below) to be extended, and, in connection with such extension, to (i) increase or decrease the Applicable Margin and/or fees payable with respect to the Revolving Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders and provide for the payment of additional fees or other consideration to the Accepting Lenders and/or (ii) change such additional terms and conditions of this Agreement solely as applicable to the Accepting Lenders (such additional changed terms and conditions (to the extent not otherwise approved by the requisite Lenders under
Section 12.01
) to be effective only during the period from the original Scheduled Termination Dates prior to its extension by such Accepting Lenders) (collectively, 
Permitted Amendments
) pursuant to procedures reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Administrative Agent. Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Permitted Amendments and (ii) the date on which such Permitted Amendments are requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business Days nor more than 45 Business Days after the date of such notice). Permitted Amendments (to the extent not otherwise approved by the requisite Lenders under
Section 12.01
) shall become effective only with respect to the Revolving Loans and/or Commitments of the Lenders that accept the Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the 
Accepting Lenders
). The Borrowers and each Accepting Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a loan modification agreement (the 
Loan Modification Agreement
) and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence (x) the acceptance of the Permitted Amendments and the terms and conditions thereof, (y) the authorization of the Borrowers to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the Loan Modification Agreement and
41
(z) the consent of the Guarantors to the Permitted Amendments. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of the Loan Modification Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, upon the effectiveness of the Loan Modification Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Permitted Amendment evidenced thereby. The Company may effectuate no more than one Loan Modification Agreement during the term of this Agreement.
(b)
    
This Section shall supersede any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including
Section 2.16
or
12.01
, it being understood that nothing in this Section shall impair or limit the effectiveness of any amendment effectuated in accordance with
Section 12.01
(including any amendment effectuated simultaneously with any Permitted Amendment).

and
3.02(d)
, and (B) to honor drafts under outstanding Letters of Credit; and (ii) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit Issued for the account of either Borrower;

Issuance Date
) and after giving effect thereto: (A) the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount; (B) the participation of any Lender in the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations and in all Swing Line Loans plus the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans of such Lender would exceed such Lenders Commitment; or (C) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and, accordingly, each Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit which have expired or which have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
(b)
    
No Issuing Lender shall be under an obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit if:
(i)
    
any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
42
Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the date of this Agreement, or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the date of this Agreement and which such Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it and for which such Issuing Lender is not compensated hereunder;
(ii)
    
such Issuing Lender has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or a Borrower, on or prior to the Business Day prior to the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or more of the applicable conditions contained in
Article V
is not then satisfied;
(iii)
    
the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is (A) more than two years after the date of Issuance, unless the Required Lenders and such Issuing Lender have approved such expiry date in writing, or (B) after the date which is seven days prior to the scheduled Maturity Date (unless the applicable Borrower confirms in writing to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent, at the time of the Issuance that would cause the expiry date of such Letter of Credit to be after such seventh preceding day, that such Letter of Credit will be a Supported Letter of Credit on the scheduled Maturity Date and such Letter of Credit is in fact a Supported Letter of Credit on the scheduled Maturity Date, in which case such expiration date shall not be later than one year after the scheduled Maturity Date);
(iv)
    
any requested Letter of Credit is not in a form reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Lender, or the Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall violate any applicable policy of such Issuing Lender;
(v)
    
such Letter of Credit is in a face amount less than $25,000 (or a lesser amount acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender), or to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars or an Offshore Currency;
(vi)
    
a default of any Lenders obligations to fund under
Section 3.03
exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender, unless such Issuing Lender has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the applicable Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Lenders risk with respect to such Lender; or
(vii)
    
any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lenders have entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the Issuing Lenders (in their sole discretion) with the applicable Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Lenders actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
Section 2.18(a)(iv)
) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.
3.02
    
Issuance, Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit
.
43
(a)
    
Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable written request of a Borrower received by the applicable Issuing Lender (with a copy sent by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent) at least three Business Days (or such shorter time as such Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of issuance. Each such request for issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be by facsimile or electronic transmission, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in the form of an L/C Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Issuing Lender: (i) the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the face amount and Applicable Currency of such Letter of Credit; (iii) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit; (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit in case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by the beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may reasonably require.
(b)
    
If JPMCB is not the Issuing Lender for a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender will, not later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day next preceding the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of the L/C Application or L/C Amendment Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the applicable Issuing Lender has received notice on or before the Business Day immediately preceding the date such Issuing Lender is to issue a requested Letter of Credit from the Administrative Agent (i) directing such Issuing Lender not to issue such Letter of Credit because such issuance is not then permitted under
subsection 3.01(a)(ii)
as a result of the limitations set forth in
clause (A)
,
(B)
or
(C)
thereof or
subsection 3.01(b)(ii)
; or (ii) that one or more conditions specified in
Article V
are not then satisfied; then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lenders usual and customary business practices.
(c)
    
From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to the Credit Termination Date (but subject to any limitation separately agreed upon between the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender), each Issuing Lender will, upon the written request of the applicable Borrower received by such Issuing Lender (with a copy sent by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days (or such shorter time as such Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender. Each such request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile, or electronic transmission confirmed immediately in an original writing, made in the form of an L/C Amendment Application and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Lender: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed date of amendment of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may reasonably require. No Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if: (A) such Issuing Lender would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
44
(d)
    
Each Issuing Lender and the Lenders agree that, while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to the Credit Termination Date, at the option of the applicable Borrower and upon the written request of such Borrower received by the applicable Issuing Lender (with a copy sent by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days (or such shorter time as the applicable Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender;
provided
that no Issuing Lender shall be entitled to authorize such automatic renewal if, at least one Business Day prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, it shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent (i) directing such Issuing Lender not to renew such Letter of Credit because such renewal is not then permitted under
subsection 3.01(a)(ii)
as a result of the limitations set forth in
clause (A)
,
(B)
or
(C)
thereof or
subsection 3.01(b)(ii)
; or (ii) that one or more conditions specified in
Article V
are not then satisfied. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile or electronic transmission, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in the form of an L/C Amendment Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Lender: (I) the Letter of Credit to be renewed; (II) the proposed date of notification of renewal of such Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (III) the revised expiry date of such Letter of Credit; and (IV) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may require. No Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to renew, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in, any Letter of Credit if: (A) such Issuing Lender would have no obligation at such time to issue or amend, and no Lender would be obligated to participate in, such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed renewal of such Letter of Credit. If any outstanding Letter of Credit shall provide that it shall be automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof receives notice from the applicable Issuing Lender that such Letter of Credit shall not be renewed, and if at the time of renewal such Issuing Lender would be required to authorize the automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in accordance with this
subsection 3.02(d)
upon the request of the applicable Borrower but such Issuing Lender shall not have received any L/C Amendment Application from such Borrower with respect to such renewal or other written direction by such Borrower with respect thereto, such Issuing Lender shall nonetheless renew such Letter of Credit, and the Company and the Lenders hereby authorize such renewal, and, accordingly, such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have received an L/C Amendment Application from such Borrower requesting such renewal.
(e)
    
An Issuing Lender may, at its election (or as required by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders), deliver any notice of termination or other communication to any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit Issued by such Issuing Lender, and take any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time and from time to time, in order to cause the expiry date of such Letter of Credit to be a date not later than seven days prior to the scheduled Credit Termination Date (unless such Letter of Credit is a Supported Letter of Credit).
(f)
    
This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with any L/C- Related Document (other than any Letter of Credit). In addition, unless the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender shall otherwise expressly agree in writing, any purported grant of (or requirement to grant) a Lien contained in any L/C Related Document shall be ineffective and null and void.
45
(g)
    
Each Issuing Lender will deliver to the Administrative Agent, concurrently or promptly following its delivery of a Letter of Credit, or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of Credit, to an advising bank or a beneficiary, a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or such amendment to or renewal of a Letter of Credit.
(h)
    
Within five Business Days after the end of each month, the Administrative Agent will send to the Borrowers and each Lender a statement reflecting the outstanding Letters of Credit as of the end of such month.
3.03
    
Risk Participations, Drawings and Reimbursements
.
(a)
    
Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit (or, in the case of each Existing Letter of Credit, on the Closing Date), each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata Share of such Lender times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of
Section 2.01
, each Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize the Commitment of each Lender by an amount equal to the amount of such participation for so long as any related L/C Obligations shall be outstanding.
(b)
    
In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent. If such Borrower receives notice of a drawing under a Letter of Credit prior to 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day on which such drawing is honored by an Issuing Lender (each such date, an 
Honor Date
), such Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 noon on the Honor Date for the amount paid by such Issuing Lender in respect of such drawing. If such Borrower receives notice of a drawing under a Letter of Credit at or after 11 a.m. on the Honor Date, such Borrower may make such reimbursement on the immediately following Business Day (and interest on the amount so paid by the applicable Issuing Lender shall accrue for the account of such Issuing Lender from the Honor Date to such immediately following Business Day at a rate per annum (subject to
subsection 2.11(c)
) equal to (i) if such amount is denominated in Dollars, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) if such amount is denominated in any other currency, the Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of both
clause (i)
and
clause (ii)
, such other rate as the applicable Borrower and such Issuing Lender shall agree)). Any reimbursement pursuant to the preceding two sentences shall be made in the same currency as the applicable drawing. If the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon on the date required above, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have requested that Base Rate Loans be made by the Lenders to be disbursed on such date in payment in an amount (the 
Reimbursement Amount
) equal to such drawing or, if such drawing was not paid in Dollars, in the amount that such Issuing Lender determines (in good faith) and specifies to the Administrative Agent to be necessary to reimburse such Issuing Lender in full for such drawing, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Commitments and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
, (excluding any notice requirement and without regard to the Minimum
46
Tranche). Any notice given by an Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection 3.03(b)
may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing (including by facsimile or electronic transmission);
provided
that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(c)
    
Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
subsection 3.03(b)
make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Reimbursement Amount, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to
subsection 3.03(d)
) each be deemed to have made Base Rate Loans to the applicable Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Reimbursement Amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the applicable date, then interest shall accrue on such Lenders obligation to make such payment, from such date to the date such Lender makes such payment, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time during such period. The Administrative Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of each Honor Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent to give any such notice on an Honor Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations under this
Section 3.03
.
(d)
    
With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Base Rate Loans to the applicable Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by
subsection 3.03(b)
, because of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
(other than any notice requirement) or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Lender an L/C Borrowing in Dollars in an amount equal to the Reimbursement Amount, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall (subject to
subsection 2.11(c)
) bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and each Lenders payment to such Issuing Lender pursuant to
subsection 3.03(c)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 3.03
.
(e)
    
Each Lenders obligation to make Base Rate Loans or L/C Advances as contemplated by this
Section 3.03
as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional and without recourse to the applicable Issuing Lender and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such Issuing Lender, either Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
that each Lenders obligation to make Base Rate Loans (but not L/C Advances) under this
Section 3.03
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.03
.
3.04
    
Repayment of Participations
.
(a)
    
Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from the applicable Borrower (i) in
47
reimbursement of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has paid the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender for such Lenders participation in the Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 3.03
or (ii) in payment of interest thereon, the Administrative Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender, the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such funds, and such Issuing Lender shall receive the amount of the Pro Rata Share of such funds of any Lender that did not so pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender.
(b)
    
If the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Lender is required at any time to return to a Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender pursuant to
subsection 3.04(a)
in reimbursement of a payment made under a Letter of Credit or any interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender the amount of its Pro Rata Share of all amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.
3.05
    
Role of an Issuing Lender
.
(a)
    
Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft and certificates expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.
(b)
    
No Issuing Lender nor any of its correspondents, participants or assignees Lender shall be liable to any Lender for: (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders (including the Required Lenders, as applicable); (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any L/C-Related Document.
(c)
    
Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. No Issuing Lender nor any of its correspondents, participants or assignees, shall be liable or responsible for any matter described in
clauses (a)
through
(g)
of
Section 3.06
;
provided
that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against an Issuing Lender, and such Issuing Lender may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower to the extent such damages are determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Issuing Lenders willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Lenders wrongful dishonor of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and

L/C Fee
), in Dollars, with respect to each outstanding Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower equal to the L/C Fee Rate for such type of Letter of Credit times the average daily maximum Dollar Equivalent amount available to be drawn on such Letter of Credit, computed on a quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter based upon Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated by the Administrative Agent. L/C Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during which Letters of Credit are outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date to occur after the Closing Date, through the Maturity Date (or such later date upon which all Letters of Credit have terminated), with the final payment to be made on the Maturity Date (or such later termination date).
(b)

At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
Section 2.18(a)(iv)
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the applicable Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
3.10
    
Release of Cash Collateral
. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided by a Borrower to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released to such Borrower (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto) promptly following (i)
50
the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
Section 12.08(e)))

provided
that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default.
ARTICLE IV TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
4.01

(b)
    
If a Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, then:
(i)
    
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 4.01
), such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;
(ii)
    
such Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;
(iii)
    
such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law; and
(iv)
    
such Borrower shall also pay to each Lender or the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, at the time interest is paid, Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed.
(c)
    
The Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of (i) Taxes, (ii) Other Taxes, and (iii) Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including interest, additions to tax, expenses and, except to the extent arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, respectively, penalties) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this
subsection
51
(c)
shall be made within 30 days after the date the applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor in accordance with
Section 4.07
.
(d)
    
Within 30 days after the date of any payment by a Borrower of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, such Borrower shall furnish to each Lender or the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to such Lender or the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall, promptly upon request by a Borrower, deliver to such Borrower copies of all completed and executed forms reasonably deemed necessary by such Borrower in connection with the payment of amounts demanded by such Lender pursuant to
subsection 4.01(c)
.
(e)
    
If a Borrower is required to pay any amount to any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection 4.01(b)
or
(c)
, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by such Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the good faith judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
(f)
    
If a payment made to a Lender would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested in writing by such Borrower, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested in writing by such Borrower as may be necessary for such Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(g)
    
Without limiting any other provision of this
Section 4.01
, each Lender (i) represents and warrants to the Borrowers that, as of the date of this Agreement (or, if later, the date such Lender becomes a party hereto), such Lender (A) is a Swiss Qualifying Lender and (B) has not entered into a participation arrangement with respect to this Agreement with any Person that is not a Swiss Qualifying Lender; and (ii) agrees that such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company if for any reason it ceases to be a Swiss Qualifying Lender.
4.02
    
Illegality
.
(a)
    
If any Lender determines that the introduction of, or any change in or in the interpretation or administration of, any Requirement of Law, in each case after the date hereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurocurrency Loans (including Eurocurrency Loans in any Applicable Currency), then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist
52
(which notice such Lender shall deliver promptly after such circumstances cease to exist), at which time such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers and such Lenders obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans shall be reinstated.
(b)
    
If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any Eurocurrency Loan, the applicable Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay in full such Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under
Section 4.04
either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loan.
(c)
    
If the obligation of a Lender to make Eurocurrency Loans has been suspended or a Lender may no longer maintain Eurocurrency Loans, then concurrently with the making of any Eurocurrency Loans by the other Lenders or with any prepayment required pursuant to
subsection (b)
above, such Lender shall (without regard to whether the conditions specified in
Section 5.03
have been satisfied in the case of Loans made pursuant to
subsection (b)
) make Base Rate Loans in a Dollar Equivalent amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the applicable Borrowing and, so long as such circumstances shall continue, all Loans that such Lender would otherwise make or maintain as Eurocurrency Loans shall instead be made or maintained as Base Rate Loans.
(d)
    
Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent under this
Section 4.02
, the affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
4.03
    
Increased Costs and Reduction of Return
.
(a)
    
If any Lender determines that, due to any Change in Law (other than any change in the Associated Costs Rate), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loans or participating in Letters of Credit or, in the case of an Issuing Lender, any increase in the cost to such Issuing Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any unpaid drawing under any Letter of Credit, then the applicable Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, within ten days after demand in accordance with
Section 4.07
(with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs.
(b)
    
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of or Loans made by such Lender, such Lenders participation in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans or the issuance or maintenance by such Lender of any
53
Letter of Credit, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within ten days after demand in accordance with
Section 4.07
of such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)
    
The per annum interest rate applicable to each Offshore Currency Loan shall be increased for any Interest Period by the Associated Costs Rate for such Interest Period.
4.04
    
Funding Losses
. The applicable Borrower shall reimburse each Lender and hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of:
(a)
    
the failure of such Borrower to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any Eurocurrency Loan;
(b)
    
the failure of such Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Revolving Loan after such Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation except as set forth in
subsection 2.05(b)
or
(c)
;
(c)
    
the failure of such Borrower to make any prepayment of any Loan in accordance with any notice delivered under
Section 2.08
;
(d)
    
the prepayment (including pursuant to
Section 2.08
or
2.09
) or other payment (including after acceleration thereof) by such Borrower of a Eurocurrency Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or
(e)
    
the automatic conversion under
Section 2.04
of any Eurocurrency Loan made to such Borrower to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period;
including any foreign exchange loss or any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurocurrency Loans or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from charges relating to any Offshore Currency Loans. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 4.04
and under
subsection 4.03(a)
, each Eurocurrency Loan made by a Lender (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Eurocurrency Rate by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Loan is in fact so funded.
4.05
    
Inability to Determine Rates
. If the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan, or that the Eurocurrency Rate applicable pursuant to
subsection 2.11(a)
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
54
the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the applicable Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders revokes such notice in writing (and the Lenders agree to so instruct the Administrative Agent promptly if the circumstances underlying such suspension cease to exist). Upon receipt of such notice, such Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If such Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Revolving Loans, as proposed by such Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by such Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurocurrency Loans. In the case of any Offshore Currency Loans, the Borrowing or continuation shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent amount of the originally requested Borrowing or continuation in the Offshore Currency, and to that end any outstanding Offshore Currency Loans which are the subject of any continuation shall be redenominated and converted into Base Rate Loans in Dollars with effect from the last day of the Interest Period with respect to any such Offshore Currency Loans.
4.06
    
Reserves on Eurocurrency Loans
. Each Borrower shall pay to each Lender, at any time such Lender shall be required under regulations of the FRB to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Loan of such Lender equal to the actual cost of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive).
(a)
    
Without limiting (but without duplication of) the foregoing
clause (a)
, each Borrower shall pay to each Lender, in respect of any Offshore Currency Loans, additional costs arising under any applicable regulations of any central bank or other relevant Governmental Authority on the unpaid principal amount of each Offshore Currency Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive).
(b)
    
Any amount payable with respect to a Loan pursuant to
clause (a)
or
(b)
above shall be paid on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided
that the applicable Borrower shall have received at least 15 days prior written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional amount from the applicable Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional amount shall be payable 15 days after receipt of such notice.
4.07
    
Certificates of Lenders
. Any Lender or Participant claiming reimbursement or compensation under this
Article IV
shall deliver to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), concurrently with making such claim, a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and a calculation of, the amount payable to such Lender or Participant hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Participant may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this
Article IV
shall not
55
constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation;
provided
that a Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
Article IV
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender delivers the applicable certificate pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 4.07
(except that, if a Change in Law giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
4.08
    
Substitution of Lenders
. At any time a Lender is an Affected Lender or a Defaulting Lender, the Company may: (i) request one or more of the other Lenders to acquire and assume all or part of such Affected Lenders or Defaulting Lenders Loans, Commitment and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans; and/or (ii) designate a replacement bank or financial institution satisfactory to the Company to acquire and assume all or a ratable part of all of such Affected Lenders Loans, Commitment and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans (a 
Replacement Lender
). Any such designation of a Replacement Lender under
clause (ii)
shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and any such substitution shall in any event be effective upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 12.08
.
4.09
    
Removal of Lenders
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if either (a) a Lender (a 
Demanding Lender
) demands any payment of any amount pursuant to this
Article IV
and the amount so demanded is disproportionately greater than the amount of compensation (if any) that the Borrowers generally are obligated to pay to other Lenders arising out of the same event or circumstance giving rise to such demand (a 
Trigger Event
) or (b) a Lender ceases to be a Swiss Qualifying Lender, then the Company may terminate such Lenders Commitment hereunder,
provided
that (i) no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Commitment termination, (ii) in the case of a Demanding Lender, the Company shall concurrently terminate the Commitment of each other Lender that has made a demand for payment under this
Article IV
that arises out of such Trigger Event and that is similarly disproportionate to the amount the Borrowers are generally obligated to pay to other Lenders arising out of such Trigger Event, (iii) the Administrative Agent, all Issuing Lenders and the Required Lenders shall have consented to each such Commitment termination (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, but may include consideration of the adequacy of the liquidity of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and (iv) such Lender shall have been paid all amounts then due to it under this Agreement and each other Loan Document (which, for the avoidance of doubt, the respective Borrowers may pay in connection with any such termination without making ratable payments to any other Lender (other than another Lender that has a Commitment that concurrently is being terminated under this
Section 4.09
)). In no event shall the termination of a Lenders Commitment in accordance with this paragraph impair or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers to make any payment demanded by such Lender in accordance with this
Article IV
.
4.10
    
Survival
. The agreements and obligations of the Borrowers in this
Article IV
shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrowers or any of the Companys Subsidiaries that may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.
10.07
    
Indemnification of Administrative Agent
. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against all Indemnified Liabilities;
provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Persons gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of any applicable Requirement of Law;
provided
that no action taken in accordance with the
80
directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of a Requirement of Law for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers. The undertaking in this
Section 10.07
shall survive termination of the Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
10.08
    
Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity
. JPMCB and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with any Borrower and any of the Companys Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though JPMCB were not the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, JPMCB or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrowers or any of the Companys Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrowers or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, JPMCB shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms Lender and Lenders include JPMCB in its individual capacity.
10.09
    
Successor Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days notice to the Lenders and the Company;
provided
that any such resignation by JPMCB shall also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders which successor administrative agent shall be approved by the Company at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Company, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender, and the terms Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender shall mean and include such successor administrative agent, Letter of Credit issuer and swing line lender, the retiring Administrative Agents appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring Issuing Lenders and Swing Line Lenders rights, powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such retiring Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender or any other Lender, other than the obligation of the
81
successor Issuing Lender to issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X
and
Sections 12.04
and
12.05
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor administrative agent as provided for above.
10.10
    
Tax Forms
. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Foreign Lender) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company, prior to receipt of any payment under any Loan Document that is subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent and the Company such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable laws that the Company make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.
(ii)
    
Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the reasonable determination of the Administrative Agent or the Company, (A) two duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of
82
any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.
(iii)
    
The Borrowers shall not be required to pay any additional amount to any Foreign Lender under
Section 4.01
(i) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this
subsection 10.10(a)
or (ii) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
subsection 10.10(a)
;
provided
that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirement of this
subsection 10.10(a)
on the date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this
subsection 10.10(a)
shall relieve the Borrowers of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to
Section 4.01
in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.
(iv)
    
The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrowers are not required to pay additional amounts under this
subsection 10.10(a)
.
(b)
    
Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.
(c)
    
If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.
(d)
    
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, neither B&S AG nor the Company shall be required to make a tax gross up or a tax indemnity payment under this Agreement, or an increased interest payment, to a Lender or an assignee, transferee or participant thereof in respect of Swiss Withholding Tax due on interest payments or other payments by B&S AG under
83
this Agreement as a direct result of such Lender, assignee, transferee or participant (x) breaching the provisions regarding the representation and warranty in
Section 4.01(g)
as to its status as a Swiss Qualifying Lender, (y) failing to comply with the limitations on assignments, transfers and participations set forth herein or (z) failing to provide a timely notice required by
Section 4.01(g)(ii)
. In the event of any such breach that has not been cured as of the applicable payment date, B&S AG shall be entitled to (1) deduct such Swiss Withholding Tax from any interest payment or other payment due from it to the breaching Lender, assignee, transferee or participant (the 
Breaching Party
) under this Agreement or (2) be promptly reimbursed by the Breaching Party for any Swiss Withholding Tax amount due from B&S AG in relation to interest paid or any other payment to the Breaching Party under this Agreement if the interest payment or such other payment was already made by B&S AG without a deduction for the relevant Swiss Withholding Tax amount.
10.11
    
Subsidiary Guaranty Matters
. The Administrative Agent shall, and the Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to, upon the written request of the Company, release any Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty if, after giving effect to such release, the Company is in compliance with
Section 7.13
(including in connection with any transaction permitted under this Agreement as a result of which a Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary). Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release any Person from its obligations under any Guaranty.
10.12
    
Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim
. In case of the pendency of any Insolvency Proceeding or similar proceeding relative to a Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on a Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a)
    
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.12
,
3.07
and
12.04
) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b)
    
to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.12
and
12.04
.
    
84
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
10.13
    
Other Agents
. None of the Lenders identified on the cover page or the signature pages of this Agreement or otherwise herein, or in any amendment hereof or other document related hereto, as being a Co-Documentation Agent or Syndication Agent (collectively the

Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Other Agents in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking any action hereunder or pursuant hereto.

Payments Set Aside
. To the extent that a Borrower makes a payment to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or the Administrative Agent or the Lenders exercise their right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its Pro Rata Share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent.
12.07
    
Severability

Assignments, Participations, etc.
(a)
    
The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (b)
of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of

subsection (d)
of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnified Persons) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)
    
Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this
subsection (b)
, participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it);
provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in
subsection (g)
of this Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (which
91
consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this
clause (ii)
shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee), an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or an Approved Fund; (iv) except for any assignment to a Swiss Qualifying Lender, an assignment of a Commitment or of any Loan to B&S AG must be approved by B&S AG (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if, after such assignment or transfer, B&S AG would be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule and the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule), except that no consent of B&S AG shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing so long as after such assignment, B&S AG would be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule and the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule; and (v) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance and, unless the Eligible Assignee thereunder is an Affiliate of the assigning Lender, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection (c
) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 4.01
,
4.03
,
4.04
,
12.04
and
12.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d)
of this Section.
(c)
    
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Payment Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice, and the Administrative Agent will provide a copy of the Register to a Borrower upon such Borrowers reasonable request. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or other substantive change to the Loan Documents is
92
pending, any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.
(d)
    
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent (but subject to
clause (iv) below
, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; and (iv) except for any participation sold to a Swiss Qualifying Lender, a participation of a Commitment or of any Loan to B&S AG must be approved by B&S AG (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if, after such assignment or transfer, B&S AG would be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule and the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule), except that no consent of B&S AG shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing so long as after such participation, B&S AG would be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule and the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in
clause (a)
of
Section 12.01
that directly affects such Participant. Subject to
subsection (e)
of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 4.01
,
4.03
and
4.04
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b)
of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 12.10
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Sections 2.16
and
12.09
as though it were a Lender. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 4.01
or
4.03
than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Companys prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 4.01
unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with
Section 10.10
as though it were a Lender.
(e)
    
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in any of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f)
    
As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
93
Eligible Assignee means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Eligible Assignee shall not include the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries;
provided
further
that no Person shall be an Eligible Assignee if, upon becoming a Lender, (x) such Person would be a Defaulting Lender or (y) B&S AG would not be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule and/or the Swiss-Twenty Non-Bank Rule.
Fund means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.
Approved Fund means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
(g)
    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a 
Granting Lender
) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an 
SPC
) the option to provide any portion of any Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Revolving Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make any portion of such Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is required under
subsection 2.15(a)
. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Company under this Agreement (including its obligations under
Section 4.03
), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender of record hereunder. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500 (unless such SPC is an Affiliate of the Granting Lender), assign any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Revolving Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-
94
public information relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
(h)
    
In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the applicable Pro Rata Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
12.09
    
Confidentiality
. Each Lender agrees to take and to cause its Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information provided to it by a Borrower or any Subsidiary, or by the Administrative Agent on such Borrowers or such Subsidiarys behalf, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use or disclose any such information other than in connection with matters directly relating to or in enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with a Borrower or any Subsidiary; except to the extent such information (a) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such Lender or an Affiliate thereof, or (b) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than a Borrower or a Subsidiary, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with such Borrower or such Subsidiary known to such Lender;
provided
that any Lender may disclose such information (i) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) to which such Lender is subject or in connection with an examination of such Lender by any such authority; (ii) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (iii) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (iv) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be party; (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (vi) to such Lenders independent auditors and other professional advisors; (vii) to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder; (viii) as to any Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly
95
permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which a Borrower or any Subsidiary is party with such Lender or such Affiliate; and (ix) subject to the restrictions above, to its Affiliates, provided that any such Affiliate agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the extent required hereunder. Each Lender will, so long as not prohibited from doing so by any Requirement of Law, notify the Company of any request for information of the type referred to in
clause (ii)
,
(iii)
or
(iv)
above prior to disclosing such information so that the Company may seek appropriate relief from any applicable court or other Governmental Authority.
12.10
    
Set-off
. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the applicable Borrower, any such notice being waived by such Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law to set off and apply any deposit (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Borrower against all Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application;
provided
,
further
, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off, (x) all amounts so set-off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.18
and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) such Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of set-off.
12.11
    
Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc.
Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Company in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to the Lender should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.
12.12
    
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument.
12.13
    
No Third Parties Benefited
. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
12.14
    
Governing Law and Jurisdiction
.
96
(a)
    
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS;
PROVIDED
THAT THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.
(b)
    
ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF
FORUM NON CONVENIENS
, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY ILLINOIS LAW.
12.15
    
Waiver of Jury Trial
. THE BORROWERS, THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE BORROWERS, THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS
SECTION 12.15
AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
12.16
    
Judgment
. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each
97
Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency
) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the 
Agreement Currency
), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the applicable Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
12.17
    
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
12.18
    
Survival of Representations and Warranties
. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.
12.19
    
Interest Rate Limitation
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
12.20
    
No Fiduciary or Implied Duties
. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree, and acknowledge their Affiliates understanding, that none of the Administrative Agent, any Other
98
Agent, any Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender or the Arranger (each a 
Lead Agent
) will have responsibility except as set forth in this Agreement and shall in no event be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties. The Company waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against any Lead Agent with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
12.21
    
USA PATRIOT Act Notice
. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act.
12.22
    
Termination of Existing Credit Agreement
. The Company and Lenders that are parties to the Existing Credit Agreement, which Lenders constitute the Required Banks under and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, hereby waive the requirement for prior notice of the termination of the Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and the prepayment of the Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) set forth in
Section 2.07(a)
and
Section 2.08(a)
of the Existing Credit Agreement and agree that concurrently with the initial Credit Extensions hereunder (and subject to
Section 5.01(g)
), the Existing Credit Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (except for provisions thereof that by their terms survive termination thereof).
12.23
    
Limitation on Liability of B&S AG
. In any case where B&S AG and the Company (other than by operation of
Article XI
) are both liable for any cost, expense, indemnity obligation or similar item under any Loan Document (a 
Joint Obligation
), the liability of B&S AG shall be limited to the portion (if any) of such Joint Obligation that is directly attributable to B&S AG;
provided
that if the amount so attributable is not determinable, then the liability of B&S AG with respect to such Joint Obligation shall be limited to a portion thereof equal to the percentage that the outstanding principal amount of all Loans made to, and Letters of Credit issued for the account of, B&S AG was of the Total Outstandings at the time such Joint Obligation was incurred.

SCHEDULE 1.01
PRICING SCHEDULE
The Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans and for Base Rate Loans, the Commitment Fee Rate and the L/C Fee Rate shall be determined from time to time based upon the Average Net Leverage Ratio as set forth in the table below:
* Levels IV and V will not be available until February 20, 2012.
** Trade/commercial letters of credit will be priced at 50% of the L/C Fee Rate set forth in the grid above.
The applicable pricing shall be adjusted, to the extent applicable, on each date on which the Company is required to deliver a Compliance Certificate pursuant to
subsection 7.02(b)
based on the Average Net Leverage Ratio shown in such Compliance Certificate;
provided
that if the Company fails to deliver a Compliance Certificate (and the related financial statements) on a date required by
subsection 7.02(b)
, then the Average Net Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to be greater than 3.00 to 1.0 until such financial statements are delivered.
If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Company or for any other reason, the Lenders determine that (a) the Average Net Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (b) a proper calculation of the Average Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in different pricing for any period, then (i) if the proper calculation of the Average Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the applicable Borrower shall automatically and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the applicable Lenders, promptly following demand by the Administrative Agent (accompanied by supporting materials (which may be in the form of financial statements prepared by the Company or the Independent Auditor)), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period; and (ii) if the proper calculation of the Average Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in lower pricing for such period, the applicable Lenders shall have no obligation to repay any interest or fees to the applicable Borrower; provided that if, as a result of any restatement or other event a proper calculation of the Average Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for one or more periods and lower pricing for one or
more other periods (due to the shifting of income or expenses from one period to another period or any similar reason), then the amount payable by the applicable Borrower pursuant to
clause (i)
above shall be based upon the excess, if any, of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for all applicable periods over the amount of interest and fees paid for all such periods.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS INCREASED NET SALES AND NARROWED NET LOSS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012 AND INCREASES GUIDANCE
    
MILWAUKEE, October 20, 2011/PRNewswire/ --
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2011.
Highlights:
We continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives in the first quarter which enabled us to improve profitability in what remains a challenging global economy, commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton. In addition, I am very pleased how our team was able to quickly respond and provide help to the areas impacted by Hurricane Irene. Their efforts demonstrate our company's ability to respond when severe weather conditions leave people without power.
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $397.3 million, an increase of $63.2 million or 18.9% when compared to the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2012 first quarter consolidated net loss was $5.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share. The first quarter of fiscal 2011 consolidated net loss was $8.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Given the seasonal nature of the business, it is typical for the company to incur a loss in the first quarter of each fiscal year.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2012 first quarter net sales were $203.4 million, which was $1.7 million or 0.8% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was driven by lower shipment volumes of engines due to reduced consumer demand for lawn and garden products in North America, offset by slightly improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on snow throwers and riding lawn and garden equipment.
The Engines Segment gross profit was $36.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $5.6 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower net sales and higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs, partially offset by slightly improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on riding lawn and garden equipment.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $42.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $5.6 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2011 due to lower spending on stock based compensation.
    
Power Products Segment:
Power Products Segment fiscal 2012 first quarter net sales were $235.3 million, an increase of $67.1 million or 39.9% from the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the U.S. as a result of a landed hurricane on the East Coast, as well as increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season. There were no landed hurricanes in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. 
The Power Products Segment gross profit was $27.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of $10.1 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase over the prior year was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales, slightly improved pricing, production efficiencies, and favorable absorption on improved plant utilization, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
The Power Products Segment fiscal 2012 first quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses of $25.3 million increased by $2.9 million from the fiscal 2011 first quarter primarily due to higher sales and marketing and professional services expenses associated with new product launches.
Corporate Items:
Interest expense was $0.8 million lower for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the same period one year ago due to the reduction in interest rate associated with the refinancing of the Senior Notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher average borrowings outstanding. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, as previously announced, the company closed on a new 5-year $500 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. This credit facility replaced the company's $500 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire in July 2012. There were no borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was negative 25.3% or $1.1 million of tax expense compared to 33.4% or a $4.1 million tax benefit for the fiscal 2011 first quarter. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we excluded from our effective tax rate calculation net losses incurred by certain of our foreign subsidiaries which cannot be benefited. Excluding these foreign subsidiary net losses resulted in taxable income for purposes of calculating the company's interim income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The net loss of these subsidiaries is typically higher in the first quarter before they enter into the lawn and garden season.
Financial Position:
Net debt at October 3, 2011 was $89.8 million (total debt of $228.0 million less $138.2 million of cash), an improvement of $66.6 million from the $156.4 million (total debt of $204.1 million less $47.7 million of cash) at September 26, 2010. Cash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal 2012 first quarter were $56.3 million compared to $55.5 million in the fiscal 2011 first quarter. Cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was primarily related to seasonal build of inventory levels and reduction of accounts payable in the quarter.
Outlook
:
For fiscal 2012, the company has increased the projection of consolidated net income to be in the range of $58 million to $68 million or $1.15 to $1.35 per diluted share prior to the potential impact of any share repurchases under the company's previously announced share repurchase program. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 are projected to be higher than fiscal 2011 by approximately 4% to 6% depending on the level of recovery of consumer spending within the outdoor power equipment category. Engines Segment sales are forecasted to be comparable to fiscal 2011 on lower volume and improved pricing while the Power Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher volumes of lawn and garden equipment, pressure washers, and portable and standby generators. Operating income margins are now projected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be in the range of $18 million to $19 million and $5 million to $6 million, respectively. The operating earnings forecast includes additional investments of approximately $12 million for continued international growth. The effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be in a range of 32% to 34%. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be approximately $60 million to $65 million.

Briggs & Stratton Corporation, through its subsidiary, Briggs & Stratton Power Products Group, LLC ("Briggs"), has changed the preferred provider of floor plan financing for its dealers to GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corporation and GE Commercial Distribution Finance Canada (collectively, "GE"). To effect this transaction, on December 1, 2011 Briggs purchased a portfolio of Briggs dealer loans from its current preferred provider of floor plan financing and, substantially contemporaneously, sold such portfolio to GE, in each case for cash. The purchase price paid by Briggs to the former provider for such assets and the purchase price received by Briggs from GE for such assets were approximately equal, and Briggs recognized only a de minimis loss on the transaction.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
 
On January 25, 2012, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the Company) authorized a plan to move existing manufacturing from the Company's Newbern, Tennessee facility to its McDonough, Georgia facility. The Company will also close its Ostrava, Czech Republic plant, shifting production to the Company's Murray, Kentucky facility. Also, the Company will continue reducing capacity by reconfiguring and idling certain assets at its Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility. This decision was made after a comprehensive evaluation of the Company's manufacturing operations following significant and prolonged market declines.
 
The Newbern, Tennessee facility currently manufactures walk behind lawn mowers and snow throwers for the U.S. domestic market. The Ostrava, Czech Republic facility currently manufactures small engines for the outdoor power equipment industry.
These changes will result in the closing of the Company's facility in Newbern, Tennessee, affecting approximately 240 regular employees and 450 temporary employees. Additionally, the closing of the Ostrava, Czech Republic facility will affect approximately 77 regular employees. The Company does not anticipate significant employment changes at its Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility. The Company will provide assistance programs, continued benefits and outplacement services for the affected employees.
 
Operations in Ostrava and Newbern are expected to wind down by March 15, 2012 and May 15, 2012, respectively. The pre-tax expense related to the restructuring activities is estimated to be $50 million to $55 million, of which, $45 million to $50 million is expected to be realized in fiscal 2012. Included in these charges are estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $35 million to $37 million for non-cash asset impairments and approximately $15 million to $18 million of other cash expenditures. The Company anticipates annualized pre-tax savings of $18 million to $20 million due to the restructuring actions.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER
AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2012; RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ANNOUNCED
    
MILWAUKEE, January 26, 2012/PRNewswire/ --
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter and first six months ended January 1, 2012.
Highlights:
    
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $447.9 million, a decrease of $2.4 million or 0.5% when compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal 2012 second quarter consolidated net income was $2.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2011 consolidated net loss was $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the three and six months of fiscal 2011 was a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to organization changes and $3.9 million of pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the redemption premium of the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs. After considering the impact of such items related to the organization changes and debt redemption, adjusted consolidated net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $3.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Consolidated net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was lower by $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011 adjusted consolidated net income.
The economic environment and the levels of consumer spending for outdoor power equipment continues to be challenging in the United States and in Europe, commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. We continue to execute our strategy of diversifying our product portfolio and seeking growth in other regions of the world. Teske continued, We are encouraged with the operational improvements we are making in our Products business which are yielding improved financial results.
For the first six months of fiscal 2012, consolidated net sales were $845.2 million, an increase of $60.8 million or 7.8% when compared to the same period a year ago. The consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $2.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $9.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
After considering the impact of items related to the aforementioned organization changes and debt redemption, the consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was improved by $2.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to the first six months of fiscal 2011 adjusted consolidated net loss of $4.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2012 second quarter net sales were $286.1 million, which was $11.7 million or 3.9% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower shipments to the European market, partially offset by a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on snow throwers and portable and standby generators.
The Engines Segment gross profit was $49.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $19.2 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower net sales, higher manufacturing spending and unfavorable absorption on lower production volumes. Higher manufacturing spending is attributed to start-up costs of $5.0 million associated with launching our Phase III emissions compliant engines. Increased pricing offset increased commodity costs.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $47.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $1.3 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 due primarily to the absence of $0.6 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year and reduced selling expenses.
Engines Segment net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2012 were $489.5 million, which was $14.0 million or 2.8% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes of engines due to reduced consumer demand for lawn and garden products in the North America and European markets, partially offset by a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on riding lawn mowers, snow throwers and portable and standby generators.
The Engines Segment gross profit was $86.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $25.0 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower net sales, unfavorable foreign exchange of $4.0 million primarily related to the Euro, and higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs and start-up costs of $6.0 million associated with launching our Phase III emissions compliant engines, partially offset by improved engine pricing.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $89.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $6.9 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense, reduced selling expenses and the absence of $0.6 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year.
Products Segment:
Products Segment fiscal 2012 second quarter net sales were $215.4 million, an increase of $29.1 million or 15.6% from the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of portable and standby generators as channel inventories continue to be replenished following the recent storm activity, as well as higher shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season.
The Products Segment gross profit was $26.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of $14.7 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase over the prior year was attributable to the increase in net sales, improved pricing, production operational improvements of $5.8 million, and favorable absorption of $4.1 million on improved plant utilization, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
The Products Segment fiscal 2012 second quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $26.2 million, which was comparable to the fiscal 2011 second quarter. Increased sales and marketing expenses and salaries expense were offset by the absence of $3.0 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year.
Products Segment net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2012 were $450.7 million, an increase of $96.7 million or 27.3% from the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the U.S. as a result of a landed hurricane and subsequent snow storm on the United States East Coast earlier in the fiscal year, as well as increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season. There were no landed hurricanes in fiscal 2011. 
The Products Segment gross profit was $54.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2012, an increase of $25.0 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011. The increase over the prior year was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales, favorable foreign exchange of $1.7 million primarily related to the Australian dollar, improved pricing, production operational improvements of $11.9 million and favorable absorption of $4.8 million on improved plant utilization, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $51.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2012, an increase of $2.9 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher sales and marketing and salaries expense, partially offset by the absence of $3.0 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year.
    
Corporate Items:
Interest expense was lower compared to the prior year periods by $4.2 million and $5.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2012, respectively. The decrease was due to $3.9 million of pre-tax charges associated with the refinancing of Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, which did not recur in the current fiscal year as well as lower average outstanding borrowings at lower interest rates in the current periods compared to the same periods a year ago.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2012 was 195.6% and 63.9%, respectively, compared to 65.3% and 40.7% in the same respective periods last year. The variation reflected between years was primarily the result of a net benefit of $5.0 million due to the settlement of U.S. audits and the expiration of a non-US statute of limitation period in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
 
Financial Position:
Net debt at January 1, 2012 was $229.1 million (total debt of $243.0 million less $13.9 million of cash), an improvement of $22.5 million from the $251.5 million (total debt of $283.0 million less $31.5 million of cash) at December 26, 2010. Cash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal 2012 first six months were $165.0 million compared to $128.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2011. Cash used in operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was primarily related to seasonal build of inventory levels and an increase of accounts receivable during the period. Approximately $23 million of the increase in accounts receivable is due to delayed funding under the Companys new dealer inventory financing facility with GE Capital, Commercial Distribution Finance. The delayed funding to the Company reduces the overall cost of funds.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, as previously announced, the Company closed on a new 5-year $500 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. This credit facility replaced the Company's $500 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire in July 2012.
As previously announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to $50 million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 801,843 shares on the open market at a total cost of $11.4 million. There were no shares repurchased in fiscal 2011.
Restructuring Actions:
In addition to its quarterly financial results, Briggs & Stratton announced today that it will move existing manufacturing from its Newbern, Tennessee facility to its McDonough, Georgia facility. The Company will also close its Ostrava, Czech Republic plant, shifting production to the Companys Murray, Kentucky facility. Also, the Company will continue reducing capacity by reconfiguring and idling certain assets at its Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility.
We continually evaluate our manufacturing footprint as we consider productivity and efficiency gains along with changes in the markets we serve. Since 2004, the U.S. lawn and garden market has declined over 33%. This significant and prolonged market decline is unlike any other this industry has seen in decades. As a result of these market changes and evaluation of our manufacturing operations, we have taken difficult, but necessary actions over the past four years in order to reduce capacity. Between 2007 and 2010, we closed an engine plant in Rolla,
Missouri, and products plants in Port Washington and Jefferson, Wisconsin. In addition, we have taken actions over the past year to reconfigure and reduce our capacity and costs at our Poplar Bluff, Missouri engine plant. The actions announced today to consolidate our manufacturing footprint further, will better align our production capacity to the markets we serve, continued Todd Teske. It was a very difficult decision to close these production facilities; however, these changes are a necessary step in executing our strategy to grow the profitability of our business and invest our resources in high margin and margin expanding areas. We will make a dedicated effort to minimize the impact of these closings on our employees and the surrounding communities.   
The Newbern, Tennessee facility currently manufactures walk behind lawn mowers and snow throwers for the U.S. domestic market. The Ostrava, Czech Republic facility currently manufactures small engines for the outdoor power equipment industry.
  
These changes will result in the closing of the Companys facility in Newbern, Tennessee, affecting approximately 240 regular employees and 450 temporary employees. Additionally, the closing of the Ostrava, Czech Republic facility will affect approximately 77 regular employees. The Company does not anticipate significant employment changes at its Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility. The Company will provide assistance programs, continued benefits and outplacement services for the affected employees.
Operations in Ostrava and Newbern are expected to wind down by March 15, 2012 and May 15, 2012, respectively. The pre-tax expense related to the restructuring activities is estimated to be $50 million to $55 million, of which, $45 million to $50 million is expected to be realized in fiscal 2012. The Company anticipates annualized pre-tax savings of $18 million to $20 million due to the restructuring actions.
Outlook
:
For fiscal 2012, the Company has revised its guidance to include the restructuring actions announced today. Including $45 million to $50 million of pre-tax charges ($27 million to $30 million after taxes) related to the restructuring activities, consolidated net income is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $41 million or $0.55 to $0.81 per diluted share prior to the potential impact of any share repurchases under the Companys previously announced share repurchase program. Excluding the restructuring actions, consolidated net income is expected to be in the range of $58 million to $68 million, or $1.15 to $1.35 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 are projected to be higher than fiscal 2011 by approximately 4% to 6% depending on the level of recovery of consumer spending within the outdoor power equipment category. Engines Segment sales are forecasted to be comparable to fiscal 2011 on lower volume and improved pricing while the Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher volumes of lawn and garden equipment, pressure washers, and portable and standby generators. Operating income margins, excluding the restructuring charges, are projected to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.0%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be $18 million and $5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year, excluding the restructuring charges, is projected to be in a range of 29% to 32%. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be approximately $55 million to $60 million.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
 
On April 25, 2012, the Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation authorized several actions being taken to execute the Company's strategy. Beginning in fiscal 2013, the Company will no longer pursue placement of lawn and garden products at national mass retailers. The Engines segment will continue to support lawn and garden equipment OEMs who provide lawn and garden equipment to these retailers. The Products segment will continue to focus on innovative, higher margin products that are sold through our network of Simplicity, Snapper and Ferris dealers and regional retailers. The Company will also continue to sell pressure washers and portable and standby generators through the U.S. mass retail channel.
Further, production of horizontal shaft engines currently made in the Auburn, Alabama plant will move to the Company's existing production facility in Chongqing, China or be sourced from third parties in Southeast Asia. The Company previously moved smaller horizontal shaft engines to the Chongqing, China plant in 2007 where these types of engines can be made more competitively. The Company will continue to manufacture portable generators in Auburn through calendar 2012 and is evaluating alternatives with respect to manufacturing, assembling or sourcing cost effective portable generators beyond 2012. The Auburn plant will continue to produce V-Twin engines used in riding mowers and other outdoor power applications.
In addition, the Company intends to reduce its salaried headcount by approximately 10% during fiscal 2012.
The Company anticipates approximately 250 regular employees will be affected by the Auburn, Alabama facility consolidation. A 10% reduction of the Company's salaried workforce would affect approximately 210 employees globally.
In January 2012, the Company announced plans to reduce manufacturing capacity through closure of its Newbern, Tennessee and Ostrava, Czech Republic plants as well as the reconfiguration of its plant in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. The total pre-tax costs of those actions and the actions announced today are expected to be $60 million to 70 million, of which approximately $45 million to $50 million of total charges will be recognized in fiscal 2012. Included in these charges are estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $37 million to $41 million for non-cash asset impairments and approximately $23 million to $29 million of other cash expenditures. The Company anticipates annualized pre-tax savings associated with these restructuring actions to be $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2013 and $40 million to $45 million in fiscal 2014.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2012; ADDITIONAL COST REDUCTION ACTIONS ANNOUNCED
    
MILWAUKEE, April 26, 2012/PRNewswire/ --
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter and first nine months ended April 1, 2012.
Highlights:
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $720.1 million, a decrease of $0.2 million or comparable to the same period a year ago. Fiscal 2012 third quarter consolidated net income was $39.9 million or $0.80 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2011 consolidated net income was $51.5 million or $1.02 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were pre-tax charges of $19.8 million ($9.6 million after tax or $0.19 per diluted share) associated with the previously announced restructuring actions to close the Ostrava, Czech Republic and Newbern, Tennesee manufacturing facilities and reconfigure operations of the engine plant in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. After considering the impact of the restructuring charges, adjusted consolidated net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $49.5 million or $0.99 per diluted share, which was lower by $2.0 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to third quarter fiscal 2011 consolidated net income of $51.5 million or $1.02 per diluted share.
The early spring warm weather we experienced in the U.S. provided an early start to the lawn and garden season domestically while sales were significantly lower in Europe as consumers are cautiously spending due to concerns about the overall economy commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. The early spring benefited our Products Group more than our Engines Group as the favorable weather drove retail sell-through. Equipment OEMs had inventory that was adequate to cover the early season activity. The Engines Group did not see significant re-orders from OEMs in the third fiscal quarter. Teske continued, We are pleased with the continued progress of our Products Group in improving the operations and the financial performance as we execute our strategy of focusing on higher margin products. While we are making progress, we have more work to do as we deliver innovative new products and improve the efficiency of our operations.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, consolidated net sales were $1.6 billion, an increase of $60.6 million or 4.0% when compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $37.4 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $42.2 million or $0.84 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were the aforementioned pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.8 million ($9.6 million after tax or $0.19 per diluted share). Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to previously announced organization changes and $3.9 million of additional pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the redemption premium of the 8.875% Senior Notes and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs. After considering the impact of items related to the restructuring charges, organization changes, and debt redemption, adjusted consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $47.0 million or $0.93 per diluted share, which was higher by $0.3 million or less than $0.01 per diluted share compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2011 adjusted consolidated net income of $46.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2012 third quarter net sales were $498.0 million, which was $5.8 million or 1.1% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes of engines due to reduced shipments to lawn and garden OEMs in the North American and European markets, and unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.6 million, partially offset by improved pricing.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit for the third quarter of 2012 was $110.3 million, which was $14.1 million lower compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 gross profit of $124.4 million. Adjusted gross profit was lower than the same period one year ago due to lower net sales, unfavorable absorption on lower production volumes, unfavorable foreign exchange of $2.4 million, and higher manufacturing spending. Higher manufacturing spending is attributed to start-up costs of $1.9 million associated with launching our Phase III emissions compliant engines. Increased pricing offset increased commodity costs.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $1.6 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2011 due to a reduction in employee compensation costs in fiscal 2012.
Engines Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were $987.5 million, which was lower by $19.8 million or 2.0% compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes of engines to OEMs for lawn and garden products in the North American and European markets, and unfavorable foreign exchange of $3.4 million primarily related to the Euro, partially offset by increased pricing, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on riding lawn mowers, snow throwers and portable and standby generators.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $196.5 million, which was $39.1 million lower compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 gross profit of $235.6 million. Adjusted gross profit was lower than the same period one year ago due to lower net sales, reduced absorption on lower production volumes of $5.4 million, unfavorable foreign exchange of $7.2 million, and higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs and start-up costs of $8.0 million associated with launching our Phase III emissions compliant engines, partially offset by improved engine pricing.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $134.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $8.6 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and the absence of $0.6 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year.
Products Segment:
Products Segment fiscal 2012 third quarter net sales were $281.3 million, an increase of $13.7 million or 5.1% from the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of standby generators, pressure washers and lawn and garden equipment. This increase was partially offset by lower shipments of snow throwers and related service parts and portable generators due to limited snowfall and a lack of ice storms in fiscal 2012.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit for the third quarter of 2012 was $37.1 million, which was $11.2 million higher compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 gross profit of $25.8 million. Adjusted gross profit was higher compared to the prior year due to favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel, improved pricing, production operational improvements of $1.8 million, and favorable absorption benefit on higher production levels, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
The Products Segment fiscal 2012 third quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.4 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase is attributable to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth, higher employee compensation expense and $0.9 million of bad debt expense recorded in fiscal 2012 attributable to distributors in the European market.
Products Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were $732.0 million, an increase of $110.5 million or 17.8% from the same period a year ago. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the U.S. as a result of a landed hurricane and subsequent snow storm on the United States East Coast earlier in the fiscal year, increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season, improved pricing and favorable foreign exchange of $5.1 million. There were no landed hurricanes in fiscal 2011. 
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $91.5 million, which was $36.3 million higher compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 gross profit of $55.2 million. Adjusted gross profit was higher compared to the same period one year ago due to the increase in net sales, favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel, improved pricing, favorable foreign exchange of $1.0 million, production operational improvements of $13.7 million and manufacturing absorption benefits of $8.7 million, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $80.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012, an increase of $7.2 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 primarily due to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth, unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.8 million, higher marketing expense domestically and increased salaries, partially offset by the absence of $3.0 million of organization change costs in the current fiscal year.
    
Corporate Items:
Interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $0.3 million higher compared to the same period a year ago due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by lower average borrowings. For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, interest expense was $4.7 million lower compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2011 due to $3.9 million of pre-tax charges associated with the refinancing of Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, which did not recur in the current fiscal year, as well as lower average outstanding borrowings at lower interest rates.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 was 20.4% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to 32.4% and 30.3% for the same respective periods last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a net benefit of $3.3 million related to Ostrava plant restructuring charges incurred during the recent quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the aforementioned restructuring charges and a net benefit of $5.0 million due to the settlement of U.S. audits and the expiration of a non-U.S. statute of limitation period during fiscal 2012.
 
Financial Position:
Net debt at April 1, 2012 was $257.6 million (total debt of $274.0 million less $16.4 million of cash), an increase of $17.4 million from the $240.2 million (total debt of $283.0 million less $42.8 million of cash) at March 27, 2011. Cash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal 2012 first nine months were $166.7 million compared to $100.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. Cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was primarily related to seasonal build of inventory levels and an increase of accounts receivable during the period. Approximately $40 million of the increase in accounts receivable is due to delayed funding under the Company's new dealer inventory financing facility with GE Capital, Commercial Distribution Finance. The delayed funding to the Company reduces the overall cost of funds.
As previously announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to $50 million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 1,459,243 shares on the open market at a total cost of $22.7 million. There were no shares repurchased in fiscal 2011.
Restructuring Actions:
The Company also announced today several additional actions being taken to execute the Company's strategy.
Beginning in fiscal 2013, the Company will no longer pursue placement of lawn and garden products at national mass retailers. The Engines Segment will continue to support lawn and garden equipment OEMs who provide lawn and garden equipment to these retailers. The Products Segment will continue to focus on innovative, higher margin products that are sold through our network of Simplicity, Snapper and Ferris dealers and regional retailers. The Company will also continue to sell pressure washers and portable and standby generators through the U.S. mass retail channel.
Briggs & Stratton also announced that production of horizontal shaft engines currently made in the Auburn, Alabama plant will move to the Company's existing production facility in Chongqing, China or be sourced from third parties in Southeast Asia. The Company previously moved smaller horizontal shaft engines to the Chongqing, China plant in 2007 where these types of engines can be made more competitively. The Company will continue to manufacture portable generators in Auburn through calendar 2012 and is evaluating alternatives with respect to manufacturing, assembling or sourcing cost effective portable generators beyond 2012. The Auburn plant will continue to produce V-Twin engines used in riding mowers and other outdoor power applications.
In addition to focusing our Products business on the dealer channel and moving certain production out of the Auburn facility, the Company also announced that it intends to reduce its salaried headcount by approximately 10% during fiscal 2012. While we appear poised for an improved lawn and garden market here in the U.S., our longer term projections of the lawn and garden market in the U.S. and in Europe do not return to the peaks that we saw in 2004 and 2005 for the foreseeable future. We previously announced capacity reductions in our manufacturing facilities and have announced today that certain portions of our current business will not be strategic for us in the future. said Todd Teske. As a result, we are taking the difficult, but necessary actions, to reduce our salaried support staff as well. While it is very difficult to take these actions, it is necessary to reach our strategic goals and position Briggs & Stratton for success in the future.
The Company anticipates approximately 250 regular employees will be affected by the Auburn, Alabama facility consolidation. The 10% reduction of the Company's salaried workforce will affect approximately 210 employees globally.
In January 2012, the Company announced plans to reduce manufacturing capacity through closure of its Newbern, Tennessee and Ostrava, Czech Republic plants as well as the reconfiguration of its plant in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. The total pre-tax costs of those actions and the actions announced today are expected to be $60 to $70 million, of which approximately $45 to $50 million of total charges will be recognized in fiscal 2012. The Company anticipates annualized pre-tax savings associated with these restructuring actions to be $30 to $35 million in fiscal 2013 and $40 to $45 million in fiscal 2014.
Outlook
:
For fiscal 2012, the Company has included in its guidance the restructuring actions announced today. Including $45 million to $50 million of pre-tax charges ($27 million to $30 million after taxes) related to the restructuring activities, consolidated net income is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $41 million or $0.55 to $0.81 per diluted share prior to the potential impact of any share repurchases under the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. Excluding the restructuring actions, the Company is reaffirming that consolidated adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $58 million to $68 million, or $1.15 to $1.35 per diluted share. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 are projected to be higher than fiscal 2011 by approximately 2% to 4% depending on the level of recovery of consumer sales of lawn and garden equipment in the U.S. offset by significantly lower sales to OEMs in Europe. As previously noted, lawn and garden sales in Europe have slowed given overall economic conditions which could cause our estimates for the year to trend toward the lower end of our guidance. However, favorable weather conditions in the U.S. could positively impact sales should favorable conditions continue throughout the season. Engines Segment sales are forecasted to be lower than fiscal 2011 on lower volume primarily in Europe and improved pricing while the Products Segment sales are forecasted higher primarily due to higher volumes of lawn and garden equipment, pressure washers, and portable and standby generators. Operating income margins, excluding the restructuring charges, are projected to be in the range of 4.5% to 4.8%, and interest expense and other income are forecasted to be approximately $18 million and $6 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the full year, excluding the restructuring charges, is projected to be in a range of 28% to 31%. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER
AND FISCAL 2012; INCREASES DIVIDEND 9%; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM INCREASED
    
MILWAUKEE, August 9, 2012/PRNewswire/ --
    
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended July 1, 2012.
Highlights:
This lawn and garden season presented significant headwinds for our two largest markets, North America and Western Europe, commented Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. The exceptionally severe drought negatively impacted sales to much of North America and more than offset the favorable growing conditions present in the early spring. In addition, consumer sentiment in North America and Europe remains very cautious. Teske continued, Despite these market challenges, we are pleased that our Products Segment substantially increased profitability in fiscal 2012 through operational efficiency improvements and higher sales and production volumes.
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $501.2 million, a decrease of $104.0 million or 17.2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 fourth quarter consolidated net loss was $8.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 consolidated net loss was $17.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share.
Included in the consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were pre-tax charges of $30.1 million ($19.3 million after tax or $0.40 per diluted share) related to previously announced restructuring actions. Included in the consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was a $49.5 million non-cash pre-tax charge ($34.3 million after tax or $0.68 per diluted share) associated with the impairment of Products Segment goodwill. After
considering the impact of the restructuring charges and goodwill impairment, adjusted consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $10.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share, which was $5.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share lower compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2011 adjusted consolidated net income of $16.5 million or $0.32 per diluted share.
Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 were $2.1 billion, a decrease of $43.5 million, or 2.1% when compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 consolidated net income was $29.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. Fiscal 2011 consolidated net income was $24.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for fiscal 2012 were pre-tax charges of $49.9 million ($28.8 million after tax or $0.58 per diluted share) related to the aforementioned restructuring actions. Included in consolidated net income for fiscal 2011 was the aforementioned $49.5 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge ($34.3 million after tax or $0.68 per diluted share), a $3.5 million pre-tax charge ($2.2 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) related to restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2011 and $3.9 million of additional pre-tax costs ($2.4 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) associated with the refinancing of our Senior Notes. After considering the impact of items related to the restructuring charges, goodwill impairment and debt refinancing, adjusted consolidated net income for fiscal 2012 was $57.8 million or $1.15 per diluted share, which was $5.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share lower compared to fiscal 2011 adjusted consolidated net income of $63.2 million or $1.25 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2012 fourth quarter net sales were $322.5 million, which was $69.8 million or 17.8% lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 19% reduction in shipment volumes to lawn and garden OEMs in the North American and European markets resulting from drought conditions in North America and economic uncertainty in Europe leading to reduced consumer purchases of lawn and garden equipment, an unfavorable mix of engines sold that reflected proportionately lower sales of units used on riding lawn mowers and unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.2 million, partially offset by improved engine pricing.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 21.1%, which was 0.3% lower compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The adjusted gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by 1.6% resulting from increased commodity costs and 1.8% from unfavorable absorption on 26% lower production volumes. This reduction was partially offset by a 1.1% benefit due to reduced manufacturing costs and 2.0% from improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of engines sold.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $45.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, a decrease of $10.9 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 due to a reduction in employee compensation costs in fiscal 2012 and a planned reduction of spend in advertising costs and other professional services in response to the softness in the global markets.
Engines Segment net sales for fiscal 2012 were $1.3 billion, which was lower by $89.6 million or 6.4% compared to fiscal 2011. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an 11% reduction in shipment volumes of engines to OEMs for lawn and garden products in the North American and European markets due to drought conditions in North America and economic uncertainty in Europe leading to reduced consumer purchases of lawn and garden equipment and unfavorable foreign exchange of $8.7 million primarily related to the Euro. This was partially offset by increased engine pricing, a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on snow throwers and portable and standby generators.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for fiscal 2012 was 20.2%, which was 2.6% lower compared to fiscal 2011. The adjusted gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by 0.8% due to reduced absorption on a 13% reduction in production volumes, 0.5% from unfavorable foreign exchange, and 3.0% resulted from higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs and start-up costs of $8.6 million associated with launching our Phase III emissions compliant engines. This reduction was partially offset by a 1.7% benefit due to improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of products sold.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $179.7 million in fiscal 2012, a decrease of $18.9 million from fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and a planned reduction of spend in advertising costs and professional services in response to the softness in the global markets.
Products Segment:
Products Segment fiscal 2012 fourth quarter net sales were $220.1 million, a decrease of $37.4 million or 14.5% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes of portable generators due to fewer spring storms in fiscal 2012, reduced sales of riding lawn and garden equipment due to drought conditions and reduced sales volume in the international markets. This decrease is partially offset by higher shipments of pressure washers in fiscal 2012 and improved pricing.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 11.4%, which was 2.8% higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The adjusted gross profit percentage was improved by 3.2% due to increased pricing and a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel and by 2.8% from reduced manufacturing spending. This was partially offset by benefits of 2.8% from higher commodity costs and 0.4% from unfavorable foreign exchange.
The Products Segment fiscal 2012 fourth quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $30.7 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase was attributable to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth, and higher employee compensation expense.
Products Segment net sales for fiscal 2012 were $952.1 million, an increase of $73.1 million or 8.3% from fiscal 2011. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased shipments of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the U.S. as a result of landed hurricane Irene and a subsequent snow storm on the United States East Coast earlier in the fiscal year, increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season, improved pricing, a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel and favorable foreign exchange of $2.3 million. This increase was partially offset by reduced shipment volumes of riding lawn and garden equipment domestically and reduced volume in the international markets. There were no landed hurricanes in fiscal 2011. 
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for fiscal 2012 was 12.3%, which was 3.5% higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The adjusted gross profit percentage improved by 3.1% from increased pricing and a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel, 1.5% due to production operational improvements of $13.9 million and 1.7% resulted from improved absorption on higher production volumes. This was partially offset by a decrease of 2.8% due to increased commodity costs.
The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $110.7 million in fiscal 2012, an increase of $12.2 million from fiscal 2011. The increase was attributable to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth, higher employee compensation expense, and $0.7 million higher bad debt expense recorded in fiscal 2012 primarily attributable to distributors in the European market.
    
Corporate Items:
Interest expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was flat compared to the same period a year ago as slightly lower average borrowings in fiscal 2012 were offset by slightly higher weighted average interest rates compared to a year ago. For fiscal 2012, interest expense was $4.8 million lower compared to fiscal 2011 due to $3.9 million of pre-tax charges associated with the refinancing of Senior Notes in fiscal 2011, which did not recur in fiscal 2012, as well as lower average outstanding borrowings at slightly higher weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2012.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 37.0%, or comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 effective tax rate of 37.3%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 2.9% compared to 24.0% reported the same period one year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a net benefit of $5.6 million associated with restructuring charges incurred in connection with closing our Ostrava plant facility and a net benefit of $5.1 million due to the expiration of a non-U.S. statute of limitation period during fiscal 2012 and the settlement of U.S. audits.
Financial Position:
Net debt at July 1, 2012 was $71.9 million (total debt of $228.0 million less $156.1 million of cash), an increase of $53.6 million from the $18.4 million (total debt of $228.0 million less $209.6 million of cash) at July 3, 2011. Cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 were $66.0 million compared to $156.9 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to a $31.6 million reduction in the decrease in accounts receivable compared to last year and cash contributions to the pension plan of $28.7 million in fiscal 2012. Approximately $19 million of the July 1, 2012 balance of accounts receivable is due to delayed funding under the Company's dealer inventory financing facility executed during fiscal 2012 with GE Capital, Commercial Distribution Finance. The delayed funding to the Company reduces the overall cost of funds.
Restructuring:
In January 2012, the Company announced plans to reduce manufacturing capacity through closure of its Newbern, Tennessee and Ostrava, Czech Republic plants as well as the reconfiguration of its plant in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. In April 2012, the Company announced plans to further reduce manufacturing costs through consolidation of its Auburn, Alabama manufacturing facility as well as the reduction of approximately 10% of the Company's salaried employees. During fiscal 2012, the Company completed manufacturing operations at its Newbern, Tennessee and Ostrava, Czech Republic plants, carried out the reconfiguration of the Poplar Bluff, Missouri plant and implemented the salaried employee reductions. As noted previously, pre-tax costs of all restructuring actions totaled $30.1 million and $49.9 million in the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively. The total pre-tax costs associated with these restructuring actions are expected to be $60 million to $70 million. In addition, the Company continues to anticipate annualized pre-tax savings associated with these restructuring actions of $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2013 and $40 million to $45 million in fiscal 2014.
Share Repurchase Program Increased:
As previously announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to $50 million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. As of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares on the open market at a total cost of $39.3 million. There were no shares repurchased in fiscal 2011.
In August 2012, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $50 million in funds associated with the common share repurchase program and an extension of the expiration date to June 30, 2014. Share repurchases, among other things, allow the Company to offset any potentially dilutive impacts of share-based compensation. The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants.
Dividend Increase:
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.11 per share on its Common Stock, payable on or after October 1, 2012 to Common Stock shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2012. This represents a 9% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend.
Outlook
:
For fiscal 2013, the Company projects net income to be in a range of $60 million to $75 million or $1.25 to $1.55 per diluted share prior to the impact of any additional share repurchases and costs related to our announced restructuring programs. The Company previously indicated that it would exit sales of lawn and garden products to national mass retailers. The estimated impact of exiting this business in fiscal 2013 is approximately $100 million of reduced sales. In addition, sales in fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by sales of portable and standby generators in response to power outages during hurricane Irene and significant east coast snow storms; however, we do not include in our annual projections revenues and profitability for significant weather events. Additionally, drought conditions in a significant portion of the U.S. have impacted the 2012 lawn and garden season considerably in the U.S. during May through July and certain projections are that dry conditions may persist at least into the fall in the U.S. The potential impact of storm activity and the dry conditions in the U.S. could cause wide variability in our sales results for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, our fiscal 2013 consolidated net sales are projected to be in a range of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion. Operating income margins are expected to improve over fiscal 2012 and be in a range of 5.1% to 5.6% and reflect the positive impacts of the restructuring programs announced during fiscal 2012. Interest expense and other income are estimated to be approximately $18 million and $7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate is projected to be in a range of 31% to 34% and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.

On August 8, 2012, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Rights Agreement between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Successor Rights Agent, dated as of August 7, 1996, as previously amended by amendments dated as of November 25, 2002, August 9, 2006, August 12, 2009 and October 13, 2009 (the "Rights Agreement"). The amendments to the Rights Agreement reflected in the Amendment, which the Board of Directors of the Company approved on August 8, 2012, among other things, extended the term of the Rights Agreement by changing the scheduled expiration date from October 17, 2012 to October 21, 2015.
The Rights Agreement as amended by the Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1. The foregoing description of the Rights Agreement and changes to the terms of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 4.1.
 
On August 8, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved amendments to Article VIII of the Bylaws of the Company (as amended, the "Bylaws") to, among other things, make the following changes relating to director and officer indemnification and advancement of expenses: (i) requiring that the Company pay any indemnification claim with respect to liabilities incurred by a director or officer in connection with a proceeding to which he or she is a party because he or she is a director or officer within 30 days of a claim, unless (x) during that 30-day period, directors who are not parties to the subject proceeding comprising a quorum of the Board determine that the director or officer engaged in a breach of duty or (y) there are not at least two directors who are not parties to the subject proceeding (if either applies, a "Negative Board Determination") (prior to the amendments, the payment was to be made within 60 days of a claim, unless a Negative Board Determination occurred during the period); (ii) allowing a director or officer to appeal a Negative Board Determination to an independent counsel, an arbitration panel or a court (prior to the amendments, a director or officer could appeal to the Board of Directors, an independent counsel, an arbitration panel, the shareholders, a court or any other method provided for in any additional right to indemnification permitted under the Bylaws); (iii) clarifying certain provisions; and (iv) providing that a director or officer is entitled to indemnification and advancement for his expenses incurred while acting as a witness in a proceeding because he is a director or officer of the Company but is not a party to the proceeding or threatened to be made a party, pursuant to procedures separate from those that apply to indemnification and advancement of expenses when the director or officer is a party to the proceeding.
The foregoing description of the amendments to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amendments, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
Article VIII of the Bylaws is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
8.01 . To the fullest extent permitted or required by the Statute, the Corporation shall indemnify a Director or Officer against all Liabilities incurred by or on behalf of such Director or Officer in connection with a Proceeding in which the Director or Officer is a Party because he or she is a Director or Officer.
Mandatory Indemnification of Directors and Officers
8.02 . Within twenty (20) days after receipt of a written request, the Corporation shall indemnify a Director or Officer, to the extent he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of a Proceeding, for all reasonable Expenses incurred in the Proceeding if the Director or Officer was a Party because he or she is a Director or Officer of the Corporation.
Indemnification for Successful Defense
8.03 .
Process for Obtaining Indemnification, Payment or Reimbursement
(a) In cases not included under Section 8.02, a Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under Section 8.01 shall make a written request therefor to the Corporation. Within 30 days of the Corporation's receipt of such request, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Director or Officer for the entire amount of Liabilities incurred by the Director or Officer in connection with the subject Proceeding (net of any Expenses previously advanced pursuant to Section 8.06 and any Expenses previously paid or reimbursed under Section 8.07) unless either:
 
 
If indemnification of the requested amount of Liabilities is paid by the Corporation, then it shall be conclusively presumed for all purposes that a Disinterested Quorum has affirmatively determined that the Director or Officer did not engage in conduct constituting a Breach of Duty.
(b) If a Disinterested Quorum determines pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i) that the Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in conduct constituting a Breach of Duty or a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then (i) whether the Director's or Officer's conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether indemnification should be denied shall be determined under Section 8.05 and (ii) the Board or a Disinterested Quorum shall contemporaneously with such determination under Section 8.03(a)(i) or, if a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, not later than the final day of the 30-day period specified in Section 8.03(a), authorize by resolution that an Authority determine, as provided in Section 8.05,
whether the Director's or Officer's conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether indemnification should be denied hereunder. If neither the Board nor a Disinterested Quorum authorizes an Authority to determine the Director's or Officer's right to indemnification hereunder in accordance with Section 8.05, then it shall be conclusively presumed for all purposes that a Disinterested Quorum has affirmatively determined that the Director or Officer did not engage in conduct constituting a Breach of Duty and the Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Director or Officer for the entire amount of Liabilities incurred by the Director or Officer in connection with the subject Proceeding (net of any Expenses previously advanced pursuant to Section 8.06 and any Expenses previously paid or reimbursed under Section 8.07).
8.04 . The Corporation shall not indemnify a Director or Officer under Sections 8.01 to the extent the Director or Officer has previously received indemnification or advancement of Expenses from any person, including the Corporation, in connection with the same Proceeding. However, the Director or Officer has no duty to look to any other person for indemnification.
Nonduplication
8.05 .
Determination by Authority of Right to Indemnification or Advancement
(a) Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, if a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03, or a request for advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 8.06, is not paid in full by the Corporation or on its behalf within the timeframes specified therein, including as a result of a Disinterested Quorum determining pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i) that the Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in conduct constituting a Breach of Duty or as a result of the fact that a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then the Director or Officer requesting indemnification or advancement shall have the absolute right exercised in his or her sole discretion to select one of the following as an Authority to determine his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement, which selection the Director or Officer shall make within the 30 days immediately following the denial of payment or the deadlines specified in Sections 8.03 or 8.06, as applicable, whichever is later:
 
 
 
(b) In any such determination by the selected Authority there shall exist a rebuttable presumption that the Director's or Officer's conduct did not constitute a Breach of Duty and that indemnification against the requested amount of Liabilities is required. The burden of rebutting such a presumption shall be by clear and convincing evidence and shall be on the Corporation or such other party asserting that such indemnification should not be allowed.
(c) If the Authority is not a court of competent jurisdiction, then within 30 days of being selected, the Authority shall make its determination and submit a written opinion of its determination simultaneously to both the Corporation and the Director or Officer.
(d) If the Authority determines that indemnification or advancement of Expenses is required hereunder, then the Corporation shall pay or reimburse the entire requested amount of Liabilities (net of any Expenses previously advanced pursuant to Section 8.06 or previously paid or reimbursed under Section 8.07) or the entire requested amount of Expenses, as the case may be, including interest thereon at a reasonable rate, as determined by the Authority, within ten days of receipt of the Authority's opinion; provided, that, in the case of a request for indemnification only, if it is determined by the Authority that a Director or Officer is entitled to indemnification against Liabilities incurred in connection with some claims, issues or matters, but not as to other claims, issues or matters, involved in the subject Proceeding, then the Corporation shall be required to pay or reimburse (as set forth above) only the amount of such requested Liabilities as the Authority shall deem appropriate in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding. The Corporation shall also pay all Expenses incurred in the determination process under (a) by either the Corporation or the Director or Officer, including, without limitation, all Expenses of the selected Authority and all Expenses relating to entering a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(e) A determination by the Authority that indemnification or advancement of Expenses is required hereunder shall be binding upon the Corporation. No prior determination by a Disinterested Quorum that the Director or Officer engaged in a Breach of Duty, or failure to make a determination, shall create a presumption that the Director or Officer engaged in a Breach of Duty. Judgment upon the determination by the Authority may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
8.06 . Within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request by a Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse his or her reasonable Expenses as incurred by or on behalf of the Director or Officer if the Director or Officer provides the Corporation with all of the following:
Advancement of Expenses
(a) An executed written certificate affirming his or her good faith belief that he or she has not engaged in conduct that constitutes a Breach of Duty in connection with the claims, issues or matters involved in the subject Proceeding in connection with which the Expenses are incurred; and
 
(b) An unsecured executed written agreement to repay any advances made under this Section 8.06 to the extent that it is ultimately determined by an Authority (which determination, in the case of a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, is a final adjudication from which there is no further right to appeal) that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation for such Expenses; provided that, for this purpose, if the Director or Officer does not make a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03 within the 120 days immediately following the completion of the Proceeding to which such advances relate insofar as the Director or Officer is concerned, then the Director or Officer shall be deemed to have made such a request on the 120th day after the completion of the Proceeding and a determination shall be made pursuant to Section 8.03, whether the Director's or Officer's conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation for such Expenses, and if Section 8.05 applies and the Director or Officer does not select an Authority pursuant to Section 8.05(a) within the 30-day period specified therein, then the Corporation may select the Authority by written notice to the Director or Officer.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the above provisions are satisfied by the furnishing of instruments that on their face comply with the requirements of this Section 8.06, then the Corporation shall be obligated to make the payments and reimbursements specified in this Section 8.06 regardless of any determination by, or belief of, the Corporation, the Board or any of the Directors questioning the contents of such instruments, including without limitation on the basis that the Director or Officer whose Expenses are to be paid or reimbursed is not acting in good faith or that he or she has engaged in conduct that constitutes a Breach of Duty. If the Director or Officer must repay any previously advanced Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.06, then such Director or Officer shall not be required to pay interest on such amounts or to otherwise compensate the Corporation on account of the repayment.
8.07 . The Corporation shall pay all reasonable Expenses of a Director or Officer that are incurred by or on behalf of the Director or Officer during the Witness Period in connection with the Proceeding to which the Witness Period relates. Without limiting the scope of such Expenses, they shall include Expenses in preparing to testify regardless of whether any testimony actually occurs. A Director or Officer who is entitled to have the Corporation pay Expenses under the first sentence of this Section 8.07 shall make a written request therefor to the Corporation. The Corporation shall make such payment within 10 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a request by a Director or Officer (or if so requested in writing by the Director or Officer, the Corporation shall within such 10-day period reimburse the Director or Officer for a payment of Expenses made by him or her). For the avoidance of doubt, a Director or Officer shall not be obligated to repay any such Expenses in the circumstances in which Section 8.06 would require repayment.
Witness Expenses
8.08 .
Nonexclusivity
(a) Sections 8.01, 8.06 and 8.07 do not preclude any additional right to indemnification or advancement of Expenses that a Director or Officer may have, including without limitation under any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall be deemed to limit the Corporation's obligations to indemnify against Liabilities or advance Expenses to a Director, Officer or employee under the Statute. Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall affect the Corporation's power to pay or reimburse Expenses incurred by a Director or Officer as a witness in a Proceeding to which he or she is not a Party.
8.09 .
Court-Ordered Indemnification
(a) Except as provided otherwise by written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, a Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the Proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. Application shall be made for an initial determination by the court under Section 8.05(a)(5) or for review by the court of an adverse determination under Section 8.05(a) (1), (2), (3), (4) or (6). After receipt of an application, the court shall give any notice it considers necessary.
(b) The court shall order indemnification if it determines any of the following:
 
 
(c) If the court determines under (b) that the Director or Officer is entitled to indemnification, then the Corporation shall pay the Director's or Officer's Expenses incurred to obtain the court-ordered indemnification.
8.10 .
Indemnification and Allowance of Expenses of Certain Others
(a) The Corporation shall indemnify an employee of the Corporation who is not a Director or Officer, to the extent that he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of a Proceeding, for all reasonable Expenses incurred in the Proceeding if the employee was a Party because he or she was an employee of the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation may indemnify and allow reasonable Expenses of an employee or agent who is not a Director or Officer to the extent provided by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, by general or specific action of the Board of Directors or by contract.
 
(b) The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion as it deems appropriate, pursuant to a majority vote thereof, indemnify a director or officer of an Affiliate (who is not otherwise serving as a Director or Officer) against all Liabilities, and may advance the reasonable Expenses, incurred by such director or officer in a Proceeding to the same extent hereunder as if such director or officer incurred such Liabilities because he or she was a Director or Officer, if such director or officer is a Party thereto because he or she is or was a director or officer of the Affiliate.
8.11 . If a claim for indemnification or advancement of Expenses is not paid in full by the Corporation or on its behalf within the timeframes specified in Section 8.03, 8.05, 8.06 or 8.07, as applicable, then a Director of Officer may at any time thereafter bring a Proceeding against the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. The foregoing right shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights a Director or Officer may have pursuant to Section 8.05 or Section 180.0854 of the Statute.
Right of Officer or Director to Bring Suit
8.12 . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was an employee, agent, Director or Officer of the Corporation against Liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in his or her capacity as an employee, agent, Director or Officer, regardless of whether the Corporation is required or authorized to indemnify or advance Expenses to the individual against the same Liability under this Article VIII.
Insurance
8.13 .
Securities Law Claims
(a) Pursuant to the public policy of the State of Wisconsin, the Corporation shall provide indemnification and allowance of Expenses and may insure for any Liability incurred in connection with a Proceeding involving securities regulation described under (b) to the extent required or permitted under Sections 8.01 to 8.12.
(b) Sections 8.01 to 8.12 apply, to the extent applicable to any other Proceeding, to any Proceeding involving a federal or state statute, rule or regulation regulating the offer, sale or purchase of securities, securities brokers or dealers, or investment companies or investment advisers.
8.14 .
Liberal Construction; Severability
(a) In order for the Corporation to obtain and retain qualified directors, officers and employees, the foregoing provisions shall be liberally administered in order to afford maximum indemnification of, and advancement of Expenses to, Directors, Officers and, where Section 8.10 of these Bylaws applies, employees. The indemnification and advancement above provided for shall be granted in all applicable cases unless to do so would clearly contravene law, controlling precedent or public policy.
 
(b) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall deem any provision of this Article VIII invalid or inoperative in whole or as applied to any specific circumstances, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions of this Article VIII contravene public policy in whole or as applied to any specific circumstances, then this Article VIII shall be construed so that the remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect, and any such provisions which are invalid or inoperative or which contravene public policy, in each case as so determined, shall be deemed, without further action or deed by or on behalf of the Corporation, to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable; it being understood that it is the Corporation's intention to provide the Directors and Officers with the broadest possible protection against personal liability allowable under the Statute. Without limiting the scope of the preceding provisions of this Section 8.14(b), if Section 8.07 as applied to a specific circumstance is deemed invalid, inoperative or contrary to public policy, then Section 8.06 shall apply as if the definition of the term "Party" includes any Director or Officer who, because he or she is a Director or Officer, was or is a witness in a Proceeding at a time when he or she was not a named defendant or respondent or threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in such Proceeding.
8.15 . For purposes of this Article VIII:

(e) "Corporation" means this corporation, any domestic or foreign predecessor of this corporation where the predecessor corporation's existence ceased upon the consummation of a merger or other transaction and any successor corporation or entity to this corporation by way of merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of this corporation.

Disinterested Quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, "Proceeding" shall include all Proceedings brought under (in whole or in part) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, their respective state counterparts, and/or any rule or regulation promulgated under any of the foregoing.

It is understood that if, prior to the commencement of such proceeding, there is no such formal notification, then such notification shall be deemed to have occurred at the time at which the proceeding is commenced.
(c) If a Proceeding is only an investigative proceeding by a government initiator (as such term is defined in subsection (b)), then no Director or Officer shall be deemed to be a Party thereto even if the authorization to conduct the investigation names the Director or Officer by position or otherwise.
 
(d) The phrase "Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained" shall mean that (i) on the day an indemnification request is received by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(a), a Disinterested Quorum is not possible because there are not at least two directors who are not Parties to the subject Proceeding or any related Proceeding on such day, or (ii) within the 30-day period specified in Section 8.03(a), a Disinterested Quorum does not determine whether the Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in conduct constituting a Breach of Duty.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Milwaukee, WI  September 12, 2012/PR Newswire/Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG)
Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the "Company") today announced that Todd J. Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas R. Savage, Senior Vice President  Corporate Development, have entered into individual stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. Teske informed the Company that under his trading plan he intends to sell 83,972 shares of Company common stock that would be issued as a result of the exercise of stock options that will expire in August 2013. The purpose of the plan is to provide Mr. Teske with the ability to exercise his expiring options and sell the underlying Company common stock in an orderly manner and avoid concerns about the timing of the transactions.
Mr. Savage informed the Company that under his trading plan he intends to sell 53,330 shares of Company common stock that would be issued as a result of the exercise of stock options that will expire in August 2013. The purpose of the plan is to provide Mr. Savage with the ability to exercise his expiring options and sell the underlying Company common stock in an orderly manner and avoid concerns about the timing of the transactions.
The amount that the executives may realize from the exercise of any options will be the number of options exercised multiplied by the amount by which the net selling prices of the Company's stock on the dates the stock options are exercised exceed the exercise prices of the stock options.
Other Company executives may from time to time adopt Rule 10b5-1 plans.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION ACQUIRES BRANCO
IN CURITIBA, BRAZIL
MILWAUKEE, Dec. 10, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced that it has acquired Companhia Caetano Branco, of Brazil ("Branco") for a total consideration of approximately $57 million in cash for the stock of the company, adjusted for certain liabilities.

Briggs & Stratton financed the transaction from cash on hand. The acquisition is not anticipated to have a significant impact on sales or earnings in fiscal 2013.

"We view this acquisition very positively for Briggs & Stratton and for all of the stakeholders in each entity  employees, customers and shareholders. With Branco's brand strength, employees and customer base, we will have an established, well performing company located in a country that has aggressive infrastructure needs and a history of higher growth opportunities, which can only add to the operating performance of our company," said Todd Teske.

ITEM 5.02
DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
(e) Modified Compensatory Plan.
On December 14, 2012 Briggs & Stratton Corporation amended its defined benefit pension plans and its defined contribution plans to freeze benefits under the defined benefit pension plans and increase benefits under the defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit pension plan amendments freeze accruals for all non-bargaining employees effective January 1, 2014, while preserving the 0.5% multiplier benefit for certain employees under the company's Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Such employees include all executives named in the company's Summary Compensation Table on page 28 of its 2012 proxy statement.
The defined contribution plan amendments are also effective January 1, 2014. These amendments increase the company's maximum matching contribution from 3.5% to 4.0% of pay and offer all domestic non-bargaining employees a company non-elective contribution of 3.0% of the employee's pay.
These contributions supplement a company non-elective contribution ranging from 3.0% to 8.0% of pay that is made for company officers who are not accruing benefits under a defined benefit plan.
The company's named executive officers participate in these plans, including the Amended & Restated Key Employee Savings and Investment Plan.
In the press release attached to the company's SEC Form 8-K filed on October 18, 2012, the company stated it expects to recognize a pre-tax curtailment charge of approximately $2.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 related to the above-described defined benefit plan changes. The impact of the amendments on the named executive officers is expected to decrease the future benefits they would have received under the company's defined benefit plans and to increase by a lesser amount the benefits they are estimated to receive under the company's defined contribution plans. Amounts related to these changes will be reflected in future years in the executive compensation tables in the company's annual meeting proxy statement titled Summary Compensation, Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.
The amendments made to the company's Amended & Restated Key Employee Savings and Investment Plan and Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

(a)    For each pay period during which the full offset under Section 2.1 or 2.2 applies, the Employer shall credit to each Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Account an amount equal to the lesser of 50% of the Participant's Deferral Contributions under Section 2.1 and 2.2 above for such pay period or (ii) 4.0% of the Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout for such pay period in excess of the prorated Compensation Limit.
(b)    For each pay period during which the offset under Section 2.1 or 2.2 does not apply, the Employer shall credit to each Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Account an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the Participant's deferral contributions under Sections 2.1 and 2.2. above up to 2% of Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout and (b) 50% of the Participant's Deferral Contributions under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above for such pay period in excess of 1% of Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout but not in excess of 6% of Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout or (ii) 4.0% of the Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout for such pay period.
(c)    For the pay period during a Plan Year in which the offset under Section 2.1 or 2.2 is discontinued, the Employer Matching Contribution formula set forth in (b) above shall apply except that the Participant's actual deferrals under the Qualified Savings Plan shall be aggregated with the Participant's deferral contributions under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 for purposes of determining the extent to which deferral contributions under this Plan are matched at the 100% rate.
2.    Section 3.2 is restated to read:
3.2

The amount of such contribution shall be equal to three percent of excess of the Participant's Regular Compensation and Total Bonus Payout over the Compensation Limit. The Employer may make such contribution annually or more frequently. For Plan Years commencing prior to January 1, 2014, the Company Nonelective Contribution under this Section was 2%.

(ii) An amount equal to 0.5% of his Average Monthly Compensation as defined in the Pension Plan but without application of the dollar limit under Cod
e Section
401(a)(17) multiplied by his years of Credited Service after 2013.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2013
MILWAUKEE, Jan. 24, 2013/PRNewswire/ -- Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2012.
Highlights:
Sales of portable and standby generators in response to Hurricane Sandy were offset by lower sales of snow throwers and engines for snow throwers in the U.S. and a significantly weaker market for lawnmowers in Australia, our third largest market, said Todd Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Sales of lawnmower engines to our U.S. OEM customers continue to show growth over last year as dealers and retailers prepare for an anticipated improvement in this year's lawn & garden season after last year's drought in the U.S. continued Teske. We continue to be pleased with the execution and the financial impact of the cost reduction activities that we began last year which are positively impacting the results of both our engines and products businesses.
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were $439.1 million, a decrease of $8.9 million or 2.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 second quarter consolidated net loss including restructuring charges was $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. The second quarter of fiscal 2012 consolidated net income was $2.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
Included in the consolidated net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were pre-tax charges of $6.6 million ($4.3 million after tax or $0.09 per diluted share) related to previously announced restructuring actions. After considering the impact of the restructuring charges, the adjusted consolidated net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $3.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share, which was $1.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share higher compared to the second quarter fiscal 2012 consolidated net income of $2.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. There were no restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2012; however, the Company did record a net tax benefit of $5.5 million in fiscal 2012 related to a reduction in tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2013.
For the first six months of fiscal 2013, consolidated net sales were $748.1 million, a decrease of $97.2 million or 11.5% when compared to the same period a year ago. The consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $17.2 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $2.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share.
Included in the consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were pre-tax charges of $11.8 million ($7.6 million after tax or $0.16 per diluted share) related to the aforementioned restructuring actions. After considering the impact of the restructuring charges, the adjusted consolidated net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $9.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share, which was a decrease of $7.0 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to the first six months of fiscal 2012 consolidated net loss of $2.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share. There were no restructuring costs incurred in the first six months of fiscal 2012.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2013 second quarter net sales were $274.2 million, which was $11.9 million or 4.2% lower than the second quarter of fiscal 2012. This decrease in net sales was driven by reduced shipments of engines used on snow thrower equipment in the North American market and walk mowers in the Australian market. Sales were also impacted by an unfavorable mix of engines sold that reflected proportionately lower sales of large engines and reduced pricing as a result of lower year-over-year material costs.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the second quarter of 2013 was 20.8%, which was 3.6% higher compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by 4.2% due to lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by the planned price decrease. The lower manufacturing costs resulted from start-up costs incurred in fiscal 2012 associated with launching our phase III emissions compliant engines, lower material costs and $2.5 million of cost savings as a result of restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2012.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, a decrease of $3.2 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower compensation costs of $2.3 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling expenses, partially offset by $0.7 million of increased pension expense compared to the same period last year.
Engines Segment net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were $438.7 million, which was $50.8 million or 10.4% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by reduced shipments of engines used on snow thrower equipment in the North American market as well as lower sales to OEM customers in the Australian and Asian markets, an unfavorable mix of engines sold that reflected proportionately lower sales of large engines and unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.6 million.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the first six months of 2013 was 18.9%, which was 1.3% higher compared to the first six months of fiscal 2012 due to lower manufacturing costs. The lower manufacturing costs improved gross margin by 1.1% due to $4.7 million of cost savings as a result of fiscal 2012 restructuring actions, 1.8% attributable to manufacturing cost improvements because of start-up costs incurred in fiscal 2012 associated with launching our phase III emissions compliant engines, partially offset by 1.6% due to the unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of a 6% reduction in engines built.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $86.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013, or $3.3 million lower compared to the first six months of fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower compensation costs of $4.6 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling costs in response to the softness in the global markets, partially offset by $2.1 million of increased pension expense compared to the same period last year.
   
Products Segment:
Products Segment fiscal 2013 second quarter net sales were $197.5 million, a decrease of $17.9 million or 8.3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced sales of snow thrower equipment and related service parts due to the lack of meaningful snowfall in the U.S. and reduced sales of lawn and garden equipment as a result of unusually dry conditions in the North American and Australian markets. This decrease was partially offset by higher shipments of portable and standby generators due to Hurricane Sandy and slightly improved pricing on lawn and garden equipment sold in the North American market.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the second quarter of 2013 was 10.6%, which was 1.8% lower compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage decreased 4.0% due to unfavorable absorption and reduced efficiencies associated with a 49% decrease in production. The McDonough, Georgia manufacturing facility was temporarily idled for four weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 to reduce inventory levels in response to a decline in market demand for snow and lawn and garden products and to re-tool the plant for new products to be launched for the upcoming spring season. This decrease was partially offset by a benefit of 2.2% due to cost savings of $4.4 million as a result of restructuring actions. The benefit of implementing price increases on domestic lawn and garden equipment sales was offset by an unfavorable mix of products sold that reflected fewer sales of higher margin service parts as well as lower sales of lawn and garden products in Australia.
The Products Segment fiscal 2013 second quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $25.4 million, a decrease of $0.9 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower compensation costs of $0.7 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling costs in response to the softness in the global markets.
Products Segment net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were $370.8 million, a decrease of $79.9 million or 17.7% from the same period a year ago. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes of snow equipment due to a lack of meaningful snowfall in the U.S and reduced sales of lawn and garden equipment resulting from prolonged drought conditions in North America and as a result of our decision to exit the sale of lawn and garden equipment through national mass retailers. This decrease was partially offset by improved pricing.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the first six months of 2013 was 11.8%, which was 0.3% lower compared to the first six months of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage benefited from cost savings of $8.4 million as a result of restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2012 as well as increased pricing. Offsetting this was the unfavorable impact of reduced absorption and inefficiencies associated with a 43% decrease in production throughput. As previously indicated, we reduced production volumes in the first six months of fiscal 2013 in order to manage inventory levels in response to a decline in near-term market demand.
The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $48.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million from the first six months of fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower compensation costs of $1.4 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling expenses in response to the softness in the global markets.
Corporate Items:
Interest expense was lower compared to the prior year periods by $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 was 156.2% and 27.8%, respectively, compared to 195.6% and 63.9% in the same respective periods last year. The second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 include a tax expense of $1.0 million primarily driven by non-deductible acquisition costs and un-benefitted losses for certain foreign subsidiaries. The second quarter of fiscal 2012 reflected a tax benefit of $5.5 million in spite of a loss before taxes of $2.8 million due to the settlement of U.S. audits and the expiration of a non-U.S. statute of limitation period in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Financial Position:
Net debt at December 30, 2012 was $228.7 million (total debt of $246.9 million less $18.2 million of cash), slightly lower from the $229.1 million (total debt of $243.0 million less $13.9 million of cash) at January 1, 2012. Cash flows used in operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were $75.4 million compared to $165.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2012. The improvement in operating cash flows was primarily related to lower working capital needs in the most recent period associated with decreased receivables, lower production levels and planned inventory reductions, partially offset by contributions to the pension plan of $16.2 million in fiscal 2013.
Restructuring:
The Company's execution of its previously announced restructuring actions remains largely on schedule. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company announced changes to its defined benefit pension plan that included freezing accruals for all non-bargaining employees effective January 1, 2014. This plan change resulted in the Company recognizing a pre-tax curtailment charge of $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. In addition to the benefit plan changes, the Company has made progress towards finalizing its exit from the Newbern, Tennessee and Ostrava, Czech Republic manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of its Auburn, Alabama plant. Given the incremental demand for engines and portable generators resulting from storms that occurred in the first six months of fiscal 2013, the Auburn plant consolidation will extend into fiscal 2014. As noted previously, pre-tax restructuring costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 were $6.6 million and $11.7 million, respectively. The total estimated pre-tax expense related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013 is expected to be $12 million to $22 million. In addition, the Company continues to anticipate pre-tax savings associated with restructuring actions of $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2013 and $40 million to $45 million in fiscal 2014.
Share Repurchase Program:
On August 10, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to $50 million in funds for use in a
common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. On August 8, 2012 the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to an additional $50 million in funds associated with the common share repurchase program and an extension of the expiration date to June 30, 2014. The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. During the first six months of fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 1,053,125 shares on the open market at an average price of $18.26 per share.
Outlook
:
For fiscal 2013, the Company continues to project net income to be in a range of $60 million to $75 million or $1.25 to $1.55 per diluted share prior to the impact of any additional share repurchases and costs related to our announced restructuring programs. The Company previously indicated that it would exit sales of lawn and garden products to national mass retailers. The estimated impact of exiting this business in fiscal 2013 is approximately $100 million of reduced sales. Although sales in the first six months of fiscal 2013 were favorably impacted by sales of generators in response to power outages during Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy, drought conditions and a lack of meaningful snowfall in a significant portion of the U.S. and a reduction in sales demand from many of our international markets have continued to negatively impact shipment volumes, offsetting the storm benefit. Our fiscal 2013 consolidated net sales are projected to be in a range of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion. Operating income margins are expected to improve over fiscal 2012 and be in a range of 5.1% to 5.6% and reflect the positive impacts of the restructuring programs announced during fiscal 2012. Interest expense and other income are estimated to be approximately $18 million and $7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate is projected to be in a range of 31% to 34%, and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
  
Branco Acquisition:
The Company also announced on December 7, 2012, that it had completed the acquisition Branco for approximately $57 million in cash, adjusted for certain liabilities. Branco is a leading brand in the Brazilian light power equipment market with a broad range of outdoor power equipment used primarily in light commercial applications in Brazil. Todd Teske commented on the acquisition stating, The acquisition of Branco is another step forward in executing our strategic initiatives to grow in higher margin products in emerging regions of the world. The Branco brand is the most recognized brand in light power equipment in Brazil. We welcome all of Branco's valued employees and dealers to Briggs & Stratton. Due to the timing of completing the acquisition, the sales and profitability were not significant to the Company's fiscal second quarter results.

BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER
AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2013; PROVIDES REVISED GUIDANCE
MILWAUKEE, Apr. 19, 2013/PRNewswire/ -- Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter and first nine months ended March 31, 2013.
Highlights:
We continue to see soft demand across international markets for engines and products due to macroeconomic concerns weighing on the minds of consumers and unfavorable weather conditions particularly in Australasia. Brazil continues to be a bright spot for growing our international products business as our Branco acquisition is performing as anticipated, commented Todd Teske, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Here in the U.S., the spring lawn and garden season has been delayed by at least a few weeks due to a prolonged cold and wet spring in many parts of the country. This is significantly different from last year when we had an unusually early start to spring with very warm weather across the country. The drought that impacted our industry so significantly last season appears to be improving east of the Mississippi River which is encouraging for the upcoming season. Despite a later start to spring compared to last year, we are optimistic that the U.S. market will be in line with our anticipated growth projections of 4 to 6%.
Consolidated Results:
Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were $637.3 million, a decrease of $82.8 million or 11.5% from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 third quarter consolidated net income including restructuring charges was $38.5 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. The third quarter of fiscal 2012 consolidated net income including restructuring charges was $39.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share. Sales of engines and products to international regions decreased by approximately $37 million compared to last years' third quarter. The majority of the remaining decrease in sales in the quarter was due to our decision to no longer sell lawn and garden products to large mass retailers in the U.S.
Included in consolidated net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were pre-tax charges of $6.6 million ($5.4 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share) related to previously announced restructuring actions. Included in consolidated net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were pre-tax charges of $19.8 million ($9.6 million after tax or $0.19 per diluted share) also related to the restructuring actions. After considering the impact of the restructuring charges, the adjusted consolidated net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $43.9 million or $0.89 per diluted share, which was $5.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share lower compared to the third quarter fiscal 2012 adjusted consolidated net income of $49.5 million or $0.99 per diluted share.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2013, consolidated net sales were $1.385 billion, a decrease of $180.0 million or 11.5% when compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $21.4 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $37.4 million or $0.74 per diluted share.
Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were pre-tax charges of $18.4 million ($13.0 million after tax or $0.27 per diluted share) related to the aforementioned restructuring actions. Included in consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were pre-tax charges of $19.8 million ($9.6 million after tax or $0.19 per diluted share) also related to the restructuring actions. After considering the impact of the restructuring charges, adjusted consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $34.4 million or $0.71 per diluted share, which was a decrease of $12.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2012 adjusted consolidated net income of $47.0 million or $0.93 per diluted share.
Engines Segment:
Engines Segment fiscal 2013 third quarter net sales were $451.9 million, which was $46.1 million or 9.3% lower than the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This decrease in net sales was driven by reduced shipments of engines used primarily on walk and ride equipment in European and North American markets as OEM customers manage inventory levels due to a later start to warmer spring weather. Net sales were also lower due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $5.4 million primarily due to a decrease in the value of the Euro in fiscal 2013. These decreases in net sales were partially offset by the timing of generator engine replenishment sales in the U.S. following the recent hurricane season.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the third quarter of 2013 was 23.5%, which was 1.4% higher compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by 3.6% due to lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by 1.2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange and by 1% due to unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of a 4% reduction in engines built. The lower manufacturing costs resulted from $3.4 million of cost savings as a result of restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2012, lower material costs, and start-up costs incurred in fiscal 2012 associated with launching our phase III emissions compliant engines.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, a decrease of $1.3 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower compensation costs of $2.5 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling expenses, partially offset by $0.6 million of increased pension expense compared to the same period last year.
Engines Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were $890.6 million, which was $96.9 million or 9.8% lower than the same period a year ago. This decrease in net sales was primarily driven by reduced shipments of engines used on snow thrower equipment in the North American market as well as lower sales to OEM customers for the European and Australasian markets. European markets were off considerably given macroeconomic issues and unfavorable weather conditions. Australasia markets were off due to a significant lack of rainfall in highly populated areas. In addition, sales were lower in fiscal 2013 due to an unfavorable mix of engines sold that reflected proportionately lower sales of large engines, and unfavorable foreign exchange of $9.7 million primarily related to the Euro.
The Engines Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the first nine months of 2013 was 21.3%, which was 1.4% higher compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by 3.4% due to lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by 1% due to unfavorable foreign exchange and by 1% due to unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of a 5% reduction in engines built. The lower manufacturing costs resulted from $8.1 million of cost savings as a result of restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2012, lower material costs, and start-up costs incurred in fiscal 2012 associated with launching our phase III emissions compliant engines.
The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $130.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, or $4.7 million lower compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower compensation costs of $7.4 million as a result of the previously announced reduction of 10% of the global salaried workforce and reduced selling costs in response to the softness in the global markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of increased pension expense compared to the same period last year.
 
Products Segment:
Products Segment fiscal 2013 third quarter net sales were $231.5 million, a decrease of $49.7 million or 17.7% from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The decrease in net sales was primarily related to our decision to exit the sale of lawn and garden equipment through national mass retailers. In addition, sales of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers decreased in North America from last year as a result of a later start to the spring selling season and decreased in international markets due to continued drought conditions in parts of Australasia. The net sales decrease was partially offset by net sales from the acquisition of Branco that were in line with expectations.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the third quarter of 2013 was 12.0%, which was 1.2% lower than the adjusted gross profit percentage for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage decreased 3.4% due to unfavorable absorption associated with a 35% decrease in production in order to control inventory levels. This decrease was partially offset by a benefit of 1.7% due to cost savings of $4.0 million as a result of restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2012.
    
The Products Segment fiscal 2013 third quarter engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $26.8 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower compensation costs of $0.7 million as a result of the previously announced reduction of 10% of the global salaried workforce, $0.7 million of lower bad debt expense, and reduced selling costs in response to the softness in the global markets.
Products Segment net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were $602.3 million, a decrease of $129.6 million or 17.7% from the same period a year ago. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes of snow equipment due to significantly below average snowfall in North America and reduced sales of lawn and garden equipment resulting from prolonged drought conditions in the United States and Australasia. In addition, the decrease in
net sales was impacted by our decision to exit the sale of lawn and garden equipment through national mass retailers. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by higher shipments of portable and standby generators in the North American market.
The Products Segment adjusted gross profit percentage for the first nine months of 2013 was 11.9%, which was 0.6% lower compared to the adjusted gross profit percentage of the first nine months of fiscal 2012. The adjusted gross profit percentage decreased 2.6% due to unfavorable absorption associated with a 43% decrease in production volume in order to control inventory levels. This was partially offset by a 1.8% benefit due to cost savings of $11.1 million as a result of restructuring actions. We reduced production volumes in the first nine months of fiscal 2013 in order to manage inventory levels in response to a decline in near-term market demand. The McDonough, Georgia manufacturing facility was temporarily idled for four weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 to reduce inventory levels in response to a decline in market demand for snow and lawn and garden products and to re-tool the plant for new products to be launched for the spring season.
The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $75.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, a decrease of $4.4 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to lower compensation costs of $2.2 million as a result of the previously announced global salaried employee reduction and reduced selling expenses in response to the softness in the global markets.
Corporate Items:
Interest expense was lower compared to the prior year periods by $0.1 million for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was 27.6% and 27.5% respectively, compared to 20.4% and 13.4% for the same respective periods last year. The tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 is lower than the 35% statutory U.S. rate due to the reenactment of the U.S. federal research and development and other credits in the amount of $1.0 million and foreign tax credits in the amount of $0.5 million which were partially offset by additional taxes of $1.0 million due to non-deductible expenses related to the Ostrava, Czech Republic plant closing. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was lower than the 35% statutory U.S. rate due to the aforementioned credits and non-deductible expenses and non-deductible acquisition costs increasing the tax expense by $0.5 million. The effective rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was lower as a result of recording a net benefit of $3.3 million related to Ostrava plant restructuring charges incurred during that quarter. The effective rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was impacted by the aforementioned restructuring charges and a net benefit of $5.0 million related to the settlement of U.S. audits and the expiration of a non-U.S. statute of limitation period during fiscal 2012.
Financial Position:
Net debt at March 31, 2013 was $239.9 million (total debt of $262.5 million less $22.6 million of cash), or $17.7 million lower from the $257.6 million (total debt of $274.0 million less $16.4 million of cash) at April 1, 2012. Cash flows used in operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were $73.8 million compared to $166.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012. The improvement in operating cash flows was primarily related to lower working capital needs in the first nine months of fiscal 2013 associated with less of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory compared to the same period last year.
Restructuring:
The Company's execution of its previously announced restructuring actions remains largely on schedule. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Ostrava, Czech Republic manufacturing facility. The transaction closed early in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company continues to make progress towards finalizing its exit from the Newbern, Tennessee manufacturing facility and the move of horizontal engine manufacturing from its Auburn, Alabama plant to China. As noted previously, pre-tax restructuring costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 were $6.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The total estimated pre-tax expense related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013 is expected to be $20 million to $22 million. In addition, the Company continues to anticipate pre-tax savings associated with restructuring actions of $32 million to $37 million in fiscal 2013 and $40 million to $45 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to 2012.
Share Repurchase Program:
On August 10, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to $50 million in funds for use in a
common share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2013. On August 8, 2012 the Board of Directors of the Company authorized up to an additional $50 million in funds associated with the common share repurchase program and an extension of the expiration date to June 30, 2014. The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. During the first nine months of fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares on the open market at an average price of $18.96 per share.
Revised Outlook
:
Due to continued weakness in consumer spending for outdoor power equipment in our international markets and a significantly reduced market for snow thrower products in the U.S. and Europe, we are revising our fiscal 2013 net income projections to be in a range of $56 million to $65 million or $1.16 to $1.33 per diluted share. These net income projections include the results of the Branco acquisition closed on December 7, 2012 and are prior to the impact of any additional share repurchases and costs related to our announced restructuring programs. The market growth estimates of 4% to 6% for the U.S. lawn and garden market remain unchanged; however, the lower end of the net income projections contemplate a later start to the spring lawn and garden season in the U.S. which could potentially have the impact of extending the season past fiscal 2013 at the end of June and into the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The Company previously indicated that it would exit sales of lawn and garden products to national mass retailers. The estimated impact of exiting this business in fiscal 2013 is approximately $100 million of reduced sales. Although sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were favorably impacted by sales of generators in response to power outages during Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy, drought conditions and a lack of meaningful snowfall in a significant portion of the U.S. prior to February and a reduction in sales demand from many of our international markets have continued to negatively impact shipment volumes, offsetting the storm benefit. Our fiscal 2013 consolidated net sales are projected to be in a range of $1.95 billion to $2.0 billion. Operating income margins are expected to improve over fiscal 2012 and be in a range of 4.8% to 5.3% and reflect the positive impacts of the restructuring programs announced during fiscal 2012. Interest expense and other income are estimated to be approximately $18 million and $7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate is projected to be in a range of 30% to 33%, and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $45 million to $50 million.
