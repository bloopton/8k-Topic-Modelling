("Air Products") annually considers and approves the selection of Air Products Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan's (the "RSSOP"), independent public accountants. The Committee decided on 29 May 2002 to no longer engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as the RSSOP's independent public accountants and has engaged KPMG LLP to serve as the RSSOP's independent public accountants for the plan year ending 30 September 2002.

During the RSSOP's two most recent plan years and through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on the RSSOP's financial statements for such years. There were no reportable events as listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Air Products has provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosure. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter, dated 30 May 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During the RSSOP's two most recent plan years and through the date of this Form 8-K, Air Products did not consult with KPMG LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or posed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the RSSOP's financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 ------------------------ FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) 23 July 2002 ---------------- Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. -------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in charter)
Item 5. Other Events - -------------------- AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 63 CENTS - ----------------------------------------------------------------- LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 23, 2002) - Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $141 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.63, for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002. Net income was up seven percent and diluted EPS was up five percent compared with prior year results of $132 million and $.60 per share. Revenues of $1.37 billion declined five percent compared with the prior year. Excluding the impact of natural gas pass-through, acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, sales increased two percent reflecting stronger chemicals volumes versus the prior year. Revenues improved five percent from last quarter, principally due to higher volumes. The company's year-on-year quarterly improvement in net income and EPS was driven by significantly lower interest expense. "We had a very good quarter," said Air Products Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John P. Jones. "Our diluted EPS of 63 cents exceeded the guidance we provided last quarter. We also posted strong sequential improvement. Excluding special items from the prior quarter, EPS was up 17 percent, driven by stronger worldwide volumes in our electronics, merchant gases and performance chemicals businesses." In the Industrial Gases segment, sales of $916 million declined 10 percent versus the prior year. Excluding natural gas pass-through, acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, sales declined one percent. Operating income declined five percent versus the prior year due to the divestiture of the U.S. packaged gas business and higher plant maintenance costs. Asia delivered stronger results driven by higher volumes. Sequentially, gases revenues were up three percent and operating income was up 12 percent. Electronics showed significant sequential improvement and posted a positive year-on-year sales increase for the first time since the second quarter of fiscal 2001. 2
In the Chemicals segment, sales of $385 million increased three percent, and operating income of $48 million increased 21 percent versus the prior year. This was due to higher performance chemicals volumes tied to end-market recovery and higher polyurethane intermediates volumes related to customer outages in the prior year. Sequentially, performance chemicals strength continued but was offset by amines margin pressures and plant outages. Equipment sales increased 27 percent over the prior year, and operating income was up due to higher activity in LNG heat exchangers and helium containers. Regarding Air Products' outlook, Mr. Jones echoed general industry concerns regarding the pace of growth in the manufacturing economy for the September quarter. "Our third quarter was encouraging, giving us confidence to reaffirm our full-fiscal year operating EPS guidance in the range of $2.32," he said. "However, the global economic situation remains particularly difficult to predict right now. We will continue to drive hard on the things we can control, positioning us to capitalize on the recovery and ensure the most attractive long-term growth prospects for our investors." Mr. Jones cited a few examples, including the company's recent acquisition of a majority interest in San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd., the largest industrial gas company in Taiwan, with 90 percent of its business serving the strategic, high-growth electronics and CPI markets; a new agreement with Motorola, Inc.'s Semiconductor Products Sector to collaborate on an advanced copper chemical mechanical planarization slurry for semiconductor processing; and recognition by the American Chemistry Council for achieving the best safety record in the category of total recordables among large-scale chemical manufacturers in the U.S. for 2001. ***NOTE: The forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed. Factors that might cause forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results include, among other things, overall economic and business conditions and demand for Air Products' goods and services during that time; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; spikes in the pricing of natural gas; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of terrorism impacting the United States' and other 3
markets; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on 1 October 2001. As required by SFAS No. 142, the company performed an impairment test on goodwill as of 1 October 2001, which indicated no impairment of goodwill. As of 1 October 2001, the company is no longer amortizing goodwill, including goodwill associated with investments in equity affiliates. Goodwill amortization in 2001 was $14.8 on an after-tax basis, or $.07 per share. Goodwill amortization for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2001 was $3.6 and $11.0, on an after-tax basis, or $.02 and $.05 per share, respectively. On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). This sale included approximately 100 facilities in 30 states associated with the filling and distribution of cylinders, liquid dewars, tube trailers, and other containers of industrial gases and non-electronic specialty gases, and the retail selling of welding hardgoods, including customer service centers, warehouses, and other related assets. The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. The assets sold generated $240 in revenues in 2001 with a modest contribution to operating income. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the revenues were approximately $100 also with a modest contribution to operating income. These facilities employed 1,200 people. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2002 included a charge of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan including packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. A charge of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $13.4, $14.1, $.4, and $2.9, respectively. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.08 and $.09 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 30 June 2002 and 2001, respectively. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.24 and $.25 to diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended 30 June 2002 and 2001, respectively. The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2001 included a charge of $30.9 ($20.0 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan. The plan included 311 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $22.4 for severence and termination benefits. A charge of $8.5 was recognized for asset impairments and other related restructuring costs. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, and other expense were $14.4, $9.4, and $7.1, 9
respectively. The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2001 also included a charge of $6.0 ($3.7 after-tax, or $.02 per share) related to a litigation settlement. In July 2002, the company increased its ownership in San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu) from 48% to 70%. Since 1987, the company has had a joint venture arrangement with San Fu, the largest industrial gas company in Taiwan. San Fu is a full service industrial gas and chemical company with a broad product portfolio supplying specialty gases, electronic piping and equipment, liquid/bulk gases, pipeline/on-site gases and chemicals to the Taiwan marketplace. For the nine months ended 30 June 2002, San Fu had revenues of approximately $153. This investment is consistent with the company's strategy of investing in growth markets (Asia) and industries (electronics) and will provide a stronger foundation for growth in both Taiwan and China. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. In July 2002, the company obtained control through the acquisition of an additional 22% of the outstanding shares at a cost of $106. As part of this transaction, put options have been issued which give other shareholders the right to sell San Fu stock to the company at market price when exercised. The options are effective from January 2005 thru January 2015 and allow for the sale of all stock owned by other shareholders to the company. 10

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 -------------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) 24 October 2002 ----------------- Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ---------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in charter)
Item 5. Other Events. - --------------------- AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 65 CENTS LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 24, 2002) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $144 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.65 for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002. Net income increased 40 percent and diluted EPS was up 38 percent compared with prior year net income of $103 million and $.47 per share. Excluding special items in the prior year quarter, net income and diluted EPS increased eight percent. Diluted EPS was up two cents from the prior quarter, one cent ahead of the company's guidance. Quarter revenues of $1.4 billion were flat compared with the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, underlying sales decreased three percent versus the prior year quarter, reflecting softer volumes in the company's North American merchant gases, lower equipment sales in the global electronics businesses, and lower prices in certain chemicals product lines. Revenues increased two percent sequentially. Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We performed well in the face of slower than expected growth in worldwide manufacturing activity. In this environment, we continued to control our costs while building on our strategic positions in key growth markets. We took a major step forward in building our leading Asian electronics position by acquiring a controlling interest in San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd., our Taiwanese affiliate. We also signed new business in the Gulf Coast with Murphy Oil USA, Inc., expanding our leading market position in the supply of refinery hydrogen for clean fuels. And we introduced Airflex(R) EF811, a new, environmentally-friendly emulsion polymer, which we believe will be a breakthrough for the coatings industry." The following discussion excludes special items recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. In the Industrial Gases segment, sales of $967 million increased one percent versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, sales declined two percent. Operating income was down one percent versus the prior year, with favorable currency and acquisitions and divestitures offset by a one-time electronics equipment sale gain in the prior year and lower North American merchant gas volumes. 2
Sequentially, gases revenues were up six percent and operating income was up four percent, as lower electronics results were more than offset by currency, acquisitions, lower maintenance costs and fourth quarter operating performance bonuses in the company's hydrogen business. In the Chemicals segment, sales of $359 million decreased one percent and operating income of $42 million increased two percent versus the prior year. Excluding currency effects, sales decreased three percent. Year-on-year cost improvements and modest volume increases more than offset margin erosion in certain product lines. Sequentially, chemicals revenues were down seven percent and operating income was down 12 percent. Lower plant costs were more than offset by lower volumes in the company's intermediates business, principally due to weaker sales to herbicide markets and customer outages. Equipment sales were down one percent versus the prior year. Operating income was nearly double as a result of favorable cost performance and higher helium container shipments. For fiscal 2002, Air Products' sales of $5.4 billion were down eight percent and net income of $519 million was flat compared with the prior year. Full year diluted EPS was $2.36, or $2.33 exclusive of special items. Commenting on the year, Mr. Jones said, "We outperformed the S&P 500 for a second year in a row, a testament to our portfolio management actions, commitment to improving return on capital, and our focused business execution. On the portfolio management front, in addition to the acquisition of San Fu, we improved our business mix by divesting our U.S. packaged gases business. And on October 1st, we completed the acquisition of American Homecare Supply, marking our entry in to the U.S. respiratory homecare market. Most importantly, our employees set many records this year in safety and global environmental performance," he said. "As was the case last year at this time, continued uncertainty in manufacturing growth forecasts requires that we provide a range of $2.40 to $2.60 for our fiscal year 2003 EPS guidance, up between three and 12 percent from our 2002 result," Mr. Jones said. "This range reflects no growth to modest growth in U.S. manufacturing production." Mr. Jones added that Air Products expects fiscal first quarter EPS in the range of 58 to 62 cents, which includes the effects of first quarter seasonality and continued weakening in the electronics markets. 3

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Goodwill - -------- The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on 1 October 2001. As required by SFAS No. 142, the company performed impairment tests on goodwill which indicated no impairment. As of 1 October 2001, the company is no longer amortizing goodwill, including goodwill associated with investments in equity affiliates. Goodwill amortization for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2001 was $3.8 and $14.8, on an after-tax basis, or $.02 and $.07 per share, respectively. Acquisitions - ------------ Acquisitions in 2002, totaling $114.8, principally included the purchase of an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. Since 1987, the company has had a joint venture arrangement with San Fu, the largest industrial gas company in Taiwan. San Fu is a full service industrial gas and chemical company with a broad product portfolio supplying specialty gases, electronic piping and equipment, liquid/bulk gases, pipeline/on-site gases and chemicals to the Taiwan marketplace. This investment is consistent with the company's strategy of investing in growth markets (Asia) and industries (electronics) and will provide a stronger foundation for growth in both Taiwan and China. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. In July 2002, the company obtained control through the acquisition of an additional 22% of the outstanding shares. As part of this transaction, put options have been issued which give other shareholders the right to sell San Fu stock to the company at market price when exercised. The options are effective from January 2005 thru January 2015 and allow for the sale of all stock owned by other shareholders to the company. Divestitures - ------------ On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). This sale included approximately 100 facilities in 30 states associated with the filling and distribution of cylinders, liquid dewars, tube trailers, and other containers of industrial gases and non-electronic specialty gases, and the retail selling of welding hardgoods, including customer service centers, warehouses, and other related assets. The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. The assets sold generated $240 in revenues in 2001 with a modest contribution to operating income. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the revenues were approximately $100 also with a modest contribution to operating income. These facilities employed 1,200 people. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). 9
The results for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2001 included a gain of $101.6 ($64.6 after-tax, or $.29 per share) related to the sale of the fifty percent interest in two cogeneration facilities located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania and Orlando, Florida. Subsequent Event - ---------------- In October 2002, the company acquired American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern U.S., for approximately $165. The company and its affiliates currently have a homecare position serving approximately 180,000 patients. With this acquisition, the company and its affiliates will provide home medical services to more than 275,000 patients in 14 countries from more than 200 locations, a significant step in the company's strategy to be a global healthcare provider. With annual sales of more than $110 and more than 800 employees, AHS is ranked among the ten largest U.S. homecare providers of respiratory therapy and home medical equipment. Cost Reduction Programs - ----------------------- The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2002 included a charge of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan including packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. A charge of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $13.4, $14.1, $.4, and $2.9, respectively. The results for the three months ended 30 September 2001 included a charge of $78.3 ($47.3 after-tax, or $.21 per share) for a global cost reduction plan. This charge included $57.2 for severance benefits and pension plan settlements, and $21.1 for asset impairments and related restructuring charges. The plan included 359 position eliminations. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $12.5, $44.0, $.7, and $21.1, respectively. The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2001 included a charge of $109.2 ($67.3 after-tax, or $.31 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2001 Plan). This charge included $79.6 for severance benefits and pension plan settlements, and $29.6 for asset impairments and related restructuring charges. The plan included 670 position eliminations in the areas of manufacturing, engineering, distribution, and overheads. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $26.9, $53.4, $.7, and $28.2, respectively. The 2001 Plan was completed in 2002, with 644 positions eliminated and total expenses of $101.5 incurred. The balance of the accrual of $7.7 was reversed into income during 2002. Litigation Settlement - --------------------- The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2001 included a charge of $6.0 ($3.7 after-tax, or $.02 per share) related to a litigation settlement. 10
Loss on Early Retirement of Debt - -------------------------------- In August 2001, the company retired $459.6 principal amount of various medium term notes - Series D, E, and F as well as $81.5 of an 8.75% debenture for an aggregate principal retirement of $541.1. The results for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2001 included a loss of $75.8 ($47.3 after-tax, or $.21 per share) as a result of the early retirement of debt, consisting primarily of retirement premiums. Equity Affiliates' Income - ------------------------- Income from equity affiliates contributed $.08 and $.32 to diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2002, respectively. Income from equity affiliates, exclusive of the gain on divestiture, contributed $.09 and $.34 to diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2001, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - ------------------------------ In September 2001, the company sold and leased back certain U.S. cryogenic manufacturing equipment for $301.9. This operating lease has a five-year term with purchase and renewal options. This lease includes a residual value guarantee by the company not to exceed $256. The probability of incurring a material loss under this guarantee is remote. Reclassification - ---------------- As of 1 October 2001, the company changed its reporting of demurrage/cylinder income to include it in revenues. Previously, it was included as an offset to cost of sales. The consolidated income statements of the prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this reclassification. The company adopted SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," as of 1 July 2002. This Statement requires gains and losses from debt extinguishments that are used as part of the company's risk management strategy to be classified as income from operations rather than as extraordinary items, net of tax. The impact on the company was to reclassify the extraordinary item recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year to income from continuing operations. 11

Item 5. Other Events. AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 56 CENTS LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 22, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $126 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.56, for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002. Excluding the cumulative effect of an accounting change for SFAS No. 143*, net income was $129 million, or diluted EPS of $.58. Excluding this accounting change, EPS was up 12 percent over the prior year. Quarter revenues of $1.4 billion were up 10 percent from the prior year and up four percent sequentially. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, currency effects, and the sales increase directly associated with higher natural gas costs, underlying sales increased three percent from the prior year, principally reflecting higher worldwide gases volumes, and were down one percent sequentially, principally due to lower chemical volumes. Operating income was $197 million, up seven percent over the prior year. Positive impacts on operating income came from acquisitions, increased gas volumes, lower than anticipated fiscal year 2002 incentive compensation costs, and favorable currency. Higher raw material and energy, increased pension, and SAP implementation costs partially offset these gains. Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Despite a weaker than expected economic climate, we continued to execute our plans consistent with our strategy, focusing on the elements of our business that we can control, including our portfolio management efforts, process improvement activities and building our leadership positions in growth markets." Industrial gas sales of $1 billion increased 13 percent versus the prior year. Operating income of $170 million was up 12 percent versus the prior year, led by improved worldwide gases volumes, the company's acquisitions in Asia and U.S. homecare, and the effect of the strengthening Euro. Sequentially, gases revenues increased six percent and operating income was down one percent, as acquisitions were more than offset by declines in electronics and volume declines in CPI related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes and customer outages. Chemicals sales of $354 million increased one percent versus the prior year. Operating income of $33 million declined 18 percent with stronger polyurethane intermediate volumes more than offset by lower margins and weaker volumes in the company's amines and performance polymers (emulsions) businesses. Sequentially, chemicals revenues declined two percent. Operating income was down 21 percent due to higher raw material costs and weaker volumes across performance materials,** partially offset by improved polyurethane intermediate operating rates. 2
Air Products' equipment segment sales of $67 million were up six percent versus the prior year. Operating income of $4 million was up $3 million versus the prior year. The company secured a new liquefied natural gas heat exchanger order during the first quarter. Equity affiliate income of $26 million increased 40 percent over the prior year. Adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods more than compensated for the transition of San Fu Chemical Co., Ltd. into the consolidated results. Regarding Air Products' outlook, Mr. Jones said, "Based on current economic estimates, the range for U.S. manufacturing growth this fiscal year now appears to be one to three percent. While we are seeing higher raw material costs and a slower first-half recovery in the manufacturing sector, particularly in electronics, our currency and tax outlook is now more favorable than it was in October. On balance, we are maintaining our EPS guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 for the year. We anticipate fiscal second quarter earnings results similar to this quarter." Air Products will hold its annual meeting of shareholders on Thursday, January 23, 2003, 2:00 p.m. EST, at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pa. The meeting can be heard on the Web at: www.airproducts.com/fin/annualmeeting.asp. ***NOTE: The forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed. Factors that might cause forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results include, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; spikes in the pricing of natural gas; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Asset Retirement Obligations The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on 1 October 2002. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The company's asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Gases on-site long-term supply contracts under which the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. At 1 October 2002, the company recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is approximately $1. Acquisitions In October 2002, the company acquired American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern United States, for $166. In November 2002, AHS acquired Home Health Services, Inc., a provider of homecare services located in West Virginia. Prior to these acquisitions, the company and its affiliates had a homecare position serving approximately 180,000 patients. With these acquisitions, the company and its affiliates will provide home medical services to more than 280,000 patients in 14 countries from more than 200 locations. With annual sales of more than $120 and more than 800 employees, AHS is ranked among the ten largest U.S. homecare providers of respiratory therapy and home medical equipment. In July 2002, the company purchased an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. With this acquisition, the company obtained control and consolidated this investment. The above acquisitions contributed $87 and $16 to sales and operating income for the three months ended 31 December 2002. Incentive Compensation Costs Operating income for the three months ended 31 December 2002 included a favorable adjustment of $8 for lower than anticipated payments of fiscal year 2002 incentive compensation costs. Equity Affiliates' Income Income from equity affiliates for the three months ended 31 December 2002 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.09 and $.07 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 31 December 2002 and 2001, respectively. 8

Masetti, tel: (610) 481-7461; email: masettaw@apci.com EDITOR'S NOTES: *On October 1, 2002, Air Products adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, requiring that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. It applies to certain of Air Products' on-site agreements, for example, where the company has an obligation to remove its equipment upon expiration of a customer contract. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 million was recorded as the cumulative effect of the accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is negligible (approximately $1 million). **On November 5, 2002, Air Products announced a reorganization of its chemicals businesses into a new Performance Materials Division.

[Air Products Logo] Exhibit 99.1 Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 03092 AIR PRODUCTS UPDATES OUTLOOK FOR MARCH QUARTER ---------------------------------------------- LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 7, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today announced it is revising its earnings outlook for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31st. Based on current financial data, the company now expects earnings per share in the range of 51 to 54 cents. The revised outlook results from lower than expected volumes in its North American merchant gases and performance polymers (emulsions) businesses, and higher energy and raw material costs impacting its merchant gases, performance polymers and methylamines businesses. In Gases, Air Products continues to experience weakness in its North American merchant business, reflecting a general slowdown in demand across the basic manufacturing industries. However, the company's growth platforms continue to perform solidly, with electronics and healthcare on track and the refinery hydrogen business performing well despite a higher level of customer outages than anticipated. Air Products' Asia gases performance also remains strong. The company's healthcare business, which includes its October 2002 American Homecare Supply acquisition, continues to perform very well. The business is driven by demographic changes and the ongoing shift to home-based services, and is not influenced by levels of industrial activity. The company's hydrogen business, which largely serves the market for transportation fuels, is relatively insensitive to levels of manufacturing. The higher cost of natural gas-used in making hydrogen-is predominantly passed through in product pricing. In Chemicals, operations have been hampered by lower than expected volumes in the performance polymers (emulsions) business, and higher than expected raw material costs, particularly in performance polymers and methylamines. Performance polymer volumes started the quarter strong, but then slowed in February and March along with the slowdown in basic manufacturing. The company is working hard to pass through the higher raw material costs, but there is a lag between the time costs are incurred and recovery of those - more -
costs. Air Products' other Chemicals businesses have shown most of the seasonal volume recovery that was expected at the beginning of the quarter. Natural gas has been the principal cause of the company's higher energy and raw material costs, averaging about $2.00 per million BTUs more than the approximate $4.00 per million BTUs cost incurred in the prior (December) quarter. Overall, higher energy and raw material costs account for about a three-cent reduction from the company's original outlook for the quarter. Air Products will issue its quarterly earnings release on April 24th before the market opens. Later that day, at 11:00 a.m. EDT, the company will host a teleconference that will be open to the public and the media in listen-only mode by telephone and Internet broadcast. Interested parties can listen to the live teleconference by dialing (913) 981-4910 and entering passcode 184937.

The Internet replay can be accessed at: www.airproducts.com/fin/quarterly.asp, and the telephone replay can be accessed beginning at 3:00 p.m. EDT on April 24th through 12:00 a.m. EDT on April 30th by calling: Domestic: (719) 457-0820 International: (888) 203-1112 Passcode: 184937 ***NOTE: This release may contain forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] News Release AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 03096 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 51 CENTS Access the Q2 earnings teleconference scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT today by calling (913) 981-4910 and entering passcode184937, or listen on the Web at www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases/Teleconference.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 24, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $114 million, or diluted earnings per share of $.51, for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. This compares to prior year net income of $126 million, or diluted earnings per share of $.57. Prior year results included a gain on the sale of the company's U.S. packaged gas business of $26 million after-tax, or $.12 per share, and a charge for a global cost reduction plan of $19 million after-tax, or $.09 per share. Quarter revenues were $1,578 million, up 20 percent from the prior year and 9 percent sequentially. The effects of acquisitions, divestitures, currency and the pass-through effect of higher natural gas prices increased sales by 14 percent. Without these factors, sales were up 6 percent over the prior year and 4 percent sequentially. Higher gases volumes and improved chemical volumes and pricing accounted for the underlying revenue increase. Operating income of $179 million increased 16 percent from $155 million in the prior year, which included a $31 million charge for a global cost reduction plan. Without this charge, operating income declined $7 million or 4 percent, as higher chemical raw material and energy costs were partially offset by higher volumes, favorable currency effects and acquisitions. Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Margins suffered this quarter due to higher raw material and energy costs and plant turnarounds. Margin recovery is our main focus in the near-term. However, we are -more-
Page 2 of 11 encouraged by improved volumes in electronics, healthcare, CPI, Asia merchant gases and higher amines, and we continue to see benefits from our portfolio management actions, including the divestiture of our U.S. packaged gases business early last year and our entry into the U.S. homecare market in October." Industrial gas sales of $1,130 million increased 27 percent. Of this increase, 19 percent is accounted for by higher natural gas pass through, currency and acquisitions. Operating income of $153 million increased 25 percent from $123 million in the prior year, which included a $26 million charge for a global cost reduction plan. Operating income was up $4 million or 3 percent without this charge. Higher worldwide gases volumes, acquisitions and favorable currency effects drove this improvement. Sequentially, gases revenues increased 10 percent. Of this increase, higher natural gas pass through, currency and acquisitions accounted for 7 percent. Operating income was down 10 percent, as a decline in North American gases volumes and the impacts of higher CPI plant outages were partially offset by favorable acquisition and currency effects. The first quarter also benefited from a favorable incentive compensation adjustment. Chemicals sales of $399 million increased 11 percent versus the prior year. Operating income of $34 million declined 20 percent from $42 million, which included a charge of $5 million for a global cost reduction plan. This decline was driven by higher feedstock costs and weaker performance polymers (emulsions) volumes, partially offset by favorable currency and stronger higher amines and performance products (polyurethane and epoxy additives) shipments. Sequentially, chemicals revenues increased 13 percent on higher volumes and improved pricing. Operating income was up 2 percent, with improved volumes mainly in higher amines and performance solutions (surfactants) and favorable currency offsetting higher feedstock costs. Air Products' equipment segment sales were $50 million. Operating income of $3 million was down $2 million versus the prior year on lower air separation and helium equipment activity. -more-
Page 3 of 11 Regarding Air Products' outlook, Mr. Jones said, "The slowdown in demand across the basic manufacturing industries is affecting our North American merchant gas and performance polymers volumes, and significantly higher energy and raw material costs are impacting our chemicals segment and to a lesser extent, gases. In addition, delays in new LNG heat exchanger orders and very low activity in air separation plants are reducing expectations for equipment segment profitability. Continued economic uncertainty is impacting near-term demand for our products and, as a result, we are revising our full year earnings outlook to a range of $2.23 to $2.37 per share, with third quarter earnings per share in the range of $.54 to $.58. In this weak environment, we are continuing our portfolio management actions and are identifying ways to improve our cost structure. Such actions could reduce our near-term outlook." ***NOTE: The forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed. Factors that might cause forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results include, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; spikes in the pricing of natural gas; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.

Page 8 of 11 AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Asset Retirement Obligations The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on 1 October 2002. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The company's asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Gases on-site long-term supply contracts under which the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. At 1 October 2002, the company recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is approximately $1. Acquisitions In October 2002, the company acquired American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern United States, for $166. Subsequently, AHS has continued to expand through the acquisition of small homecare businesses. In July 2002, the company purchased an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. With this acquisition, the company obtained control and consolidated this investment. The above acquisitions contributed $172 and $28 to sales and operating income for the six months ended 31 March 2003. Divestitures On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the assets sold generated revenues of approximately $100 also with a modest contribution to operating income. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the three and six months ended 31 March 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). On 1 April 2003, the company completed the sale of the majority of its Canadian packaged gas business to the BOC Group for approximately $40. -more-
Page 9 of 11 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the three and six months ended 31 March 2002 included a charge of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan including U.S. packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. A charge of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $13.4, $14.1, $.4, and $2.9, respectively. This cost reduction plan was completed as expected in March 2003. Equity Affiliates' Income Income from equity affiliates for the six months ended 31 March 2003 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.06 and $.09 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.15 and $.16 to diluted earnings per share for six months ended 31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively. -more-

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (June 30, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD), a globally diversified gases and chemicals company and a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, a division of Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH), in a cash transaction valued at approximately USD $300 million. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be accretive to earnings in the first year. Closing would follow receipt of regulatory approvals. Ashland's Electronic Chemicals business is a leading global electronic service provider and supplier of ultrapure specialty chemicals used by the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices. Ashland Electronic Chemicals business offerings include ACT(R) photoresist strippers; etch residue strippers and low-k dielectric and copper strippers; high-purity process chemicals (HPPC) offering basic and custom-performance blends of acids and solvents; copper plating solutions; chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries and post-CMP cleaners; and Fab Services which provide on-site chemical management, parts cleaning, and tool assembly and refurbishment for semiconductor manufacturing plants--or fabs.

Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] News Release - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 03251 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EPS OF 12 CENTS INCLUDING GLOBAL COST REDUCTION CHARGE AIMED AT INCREASING PROFITABILITY Access the Q3 earnings teleconference scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EDT on July 28 by calling (719) 457-2649 and entering passcode 254306 or listen on the Web at: www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 28, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $27 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.12 for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003, which includes an after-tax global cost reduction charge of $96.6 million, or $.43 EPS. This charge includes asset disposals and facility closures in the company's Gases and Chemicals segments, and accruals for severance and pension-related benefits. Before including the impact of the charge, net income was $123 million and diluted EPS was $.55 per share, each down 13 percent compared with prior year results.* Quarter revenues of $1,630 million were up 19 percent from the prior year. The effects of acquisitions, divestitures, currency, and the pass-through effect of higher natural gas prices accounted for 16 percent of the increase. Improved volumes in both the Gases and Chemicals businesses primarily drove the three percent underlying sales improvement. Sequentially, sales were up three percent. Operating income of $40 million included a charge of $153 million for the global cost reduction plan. Before the impact of the charge, operating income of $193 million was down 10 percent versus prior year and up eight percent sequentially.* Stronger sales volumes in Gases and Chemicals, favorable currency, and lower maintenance costs in the company's CPI business drove this sequential improvement. Commenting on the quarter results, John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am encouraged by the improvement in our businesses compared to -more-
Page 2 of 14 last quarter. We saw better results in Gases, with stronger volumes in electronics and CPI. Chemicals volumes also improved, but margins were hurt by continued high raw material costs." Gases segment sales of $1,138 million increased 24 percent over the prior year. Of this increase, 22 percent is accounted for by acquisitions, currency and higher natural gas pass-through effects. Gases operating income of $79 million included the global cost reduction plan charge of $92 million. Before this charge, operating income of $171 million was up three percent versus the prior year, largely a function of acquisitions and favorable currency effects partially offset by higher operating costs and lower electronics pricing.* Sequentially, Gases revenues increased one percent. Pre-charge operating income increased 12 percent on improved sales volumes, lower maintenance costs and favorable currency effects.* Chemicals segment sales of $421 million increased nine percent versus the prior year. Of this increase, five percent is accounted for by currency, divestitures and higher natural gas pass-through effects. An operating loss of $29 million was reported in the quarter, which includes the global cost reduction plan charge of $58 million. Before this charge, operating income declined 40 percent over the prior year to $29 million, principally on higher feedstock costs.* Sequentially, Chemicals revenues increased six percent, mainly on higher volumes and favorable currency. Pre-charge operating income was 14 percent below prior quarter, as higher maintenance and raw material costs more than offset sequential volume improvement.* Equipment segment sales of $71 million were three percent below prior year and up 41 percent sequentially. The operating loss of $0.6 million in the quarter included the global cost reduction plan charge of $2.4 million. Before this charge, operating income of $1.8 million was down $3.9 million year on year, due to lower helium container sales and weak non-LNG project activity.* Sequentially, operating income was down on reduced LNG project activity, with two LNG heat exchangers completed this quarter. -more-
Page 3 of 14 Summarizing the quarter results, Mr. Jones said, "In Gases, we are seeing stable North American merchant volumes, a slightly improving electronics outlook, and continuing strong demand in hydrogen, healthcare and Asia. In Chemicals, although we are now seeing some stability in energy and raw material costs, our volume improvement this quarter did not meet our expectations. "We also announced two major strategic developments in the quarter. First, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the electronic chemicals business of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, a division of Ashland Inc. This transaction will significantly expand our position in specialty materials, the principal growth driver of our electronics business; strengthen our global position as a market leader in the industry; and capitalize on our unique skills as the world's only combined gases and chemicals company. "Second, to position the company for improved profitability in this environment, we are implementing a global cost reduction plan to reduce capacity and costs in several businesses. These actions will cover three areas. First, we have shut down or will divest several underutilized facilities within our Gases and Chemicals segments. Second, we are implementing cost reductions to improve productivity, including balancing engineering resources with project activity. And third, we are reducing the number of management positions in the company to streamline our structure. Collectively, these actions will result in the elimination of 461 positions worldwide." Regarding Air Products' outlook, Mr. Jones said, "As we enter our final fiscal quarter, our guidance assumes an improving electronics market, stable to decreasing raw material costs and continued modest manufacturing growth. This should yield a sequential earnings improvement in the fourth quarter to an EPS range of $.58 to $.61, and a full-year EPS around the bottom of last quarter's guidance range, which excluded the impact of the cost reduction charge." Mr. Jones concluded by saying, "Our leadership team is committed to making Air Products a more productive, focused and efficient company, and in turn, a more attractive investment. We have a stable business mix. We have significant operating leverage as markets continue to recover. And we have four solid growth platforms that represent approximately half of our -more-
Page 4 of 14 sales, with double-digit average growth opportunities going forward. We will drive profitability using our portfolio management process, especially in these challenging economic times when payoffs aren't always immediate.

Page 10 of 14 AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Asset Retirement Obligations The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on 1 October 2002. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The company's asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Gases on-site long-term supply contracts under which the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. At 1 October 2002, the company recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is approximately $1. Acquisitions On 30 June 2003, the company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, a division of Ashland Inc., in a cash transaction valued at approximately $300 million. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals. Honeywell International Inc. has filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court in New Castle County, Delaware seeking to block the acquisition alleging the acquisition would cause a breach of an agreement between a Honeywell joint venture and the company. Ashland's Electronic Chemicals business is a leading global electronic service provider and supplier of ultrapure specialty chemicals used by the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices. Acquisitions for the nine months ended 30 June 2003, totaling $234.2, included American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), additional small homecare businesses, and Sanwa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. The principal acquisition of the company was AHS in October 2002, for $166. AHS is a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern United States. In July 2002, the company purchased an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. With this acquisition, the company obtained control and consolidated this investment. The acquisitions in 2003 and the San Fu acquisition in 2002 contributed $290 and $47 to sales and operating income, respectively, for the nine months ended 30 June 2003. Divestitures On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, -more-
Page 11 of 14 to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the assets sold generated revenues of approximately $100 also with a modest contribution to operating income. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). On 1 April 2003, the company completed the sale of the majority of its Canadian packaged gas business to the BOC Group for approximately $40. 2003 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2003 included a charge of $152.7 ($96.6 after-tax, or $.43 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2003 Plan). This charge included $56.8 for severance and pension related benefits recorded in cost of sales, selling and administrative, and research and development and $95.9 for asset disposals and facility closures in the Gases and Chemicals segments recorded in other expense. During the third quarter of 2003, the company completed a capacity utilization analysis in several businesses in the Gases segment. To reduce capacity and costs several facilities ceased operation by 30 June 2003. A charge of $37.6 was recognized for the closure of these facilities, net of expected recovery. A decision was made to terminate several incomplete capacity expansion projects. A charge of $13.0 was recognized for the cost of terminating these projects, net of expected recovery from disposal and redeployment. A charge of $3.6 was also recognized for the planned sale of two real estate properties and the termination of several leases for small facilities. These charges are principally in our North American merchant and tonnage businesses with a modest amount in our Electronics business. The rationalization of excess capacity in certain products has resulted in a decision to exit certain Chemical Intermediates operations. Late in the quarter ending 30 June 2003, the company decided to pursue the sale of its European methylamines and derivatives business. The company expects to complete the sale by 30 June 2004. Expected proceeds from sale were determined and a loss was recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the assets and the expected net proceeds from the sales. Additional charges for the closure of its methanol and ammonia plants in Pensacola, Florida, which make products for internal consumption were also recognized. The total charge for these actions was $41.7. In addition to the capacity reduction initiatives, the company continues to implement cost reduction and productivity related efforts. The divestitures, the capacity reductions and the cost control initiatives will result in the elimination of 461 positions from the company. The company will complete the 2003 Plan by 30 June 2004. Approximately 30% of the position reductions relate to capacity rationalization and divestitures. An additional 40% relates to ongoing productivity efforts and balancing engineering resources with project activity and the remaining 30% relates to a reduction in the number of management positions. -more-
Page 12 of 14 The 2003 global cost reduction plan charges were recorded to the following income statement line items and operating segments: Results for the remainder of 2003 and beyond will benefit from the 2003 global cost reduction plan. Cost savings of $3 are expected in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cost savings of $38 are expected in 2004. Beyond 2004, the company expects the 2003 global cost reduction plan to provide annualized incremental cost savings of $59, of which the majority is related to reduced personnel costs. 2002 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2002 included a charge of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2002 Plan) including U.S. packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. A charge of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $13.4, $14.1, $.4, and $2.9, respectively. This cost reduction plan was completed as expected in March 2003. Equity Affiliates' Income Income from equity affiliates for the nine months ended 30 June 2003 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. $8 is included in Other equity affiliates and $6 is included in Gases equity affiliates. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.08 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 30 June 2003 and 2002. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.23 and $.24 to diluted earnings per share for nine months ended 30 June 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income Taxes The company had a net tax benefit of $2.9 for the three months ended 30 June 2003. The net benefit was driven by the impact of the 2003 global cost reduction plan charges, which were taxed at statutory rates. -more-

Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] NEWS RELEASE ____________________________________________________________________ AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EPS OF 58 CENTS Access the Q4 earnings teleconference scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EST on October 28 by calling (719) 457-2665 and entering passcode 310373, or listen on the Web: www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 28, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $131 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.58 for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. Net income declined nine percent and diluted EPS was down 11 percent compared with prior year net income of $144 million and $.65 per share. Sequentially, EPS was up $.46 from the prior quarter, which included a global cost reduction charge of $.43 per share. Quarter revenues of $1,642 million were up 17 percent from the prior year. Two-thirds of this increase was associated with acquisitions and base business growth, while the remainder was due to higher natural gas costs passed through contractually to customers, favorable currency effects and divestitures. Sequentially, revenues increased one percent due to acquisitions. Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our results improved sequentially, with improved Gases performance in North America, and as we indicated in our prior earnings guidance, a lower tax rate in the quarter. We continued to make progress with our portfolio management actions, completing the acquisition of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company's Electronic Chemicals business. In addition, we're on track to achieve the savings associated with the global cost reduction plan we announced last quarter." Gases segment sales of $1,145 million increased 18 percent over the prior year. Nearly two-thirds of this increase was associated with acquisitions and base business growth, while the remainder was due to higher natural gas costs passed through contractually to customers, favorable currency effects and divestitures. Gases operating income of $182 million was up five percent from the prior year. Favorable volumes across all businesses, improved liquid bulk pricing, acquisitions and favorable currency effects were partially offset by higher costs, including pension and SAP implementation expenses, and lower average selling prices in the company's electronics business. -more-
Sequentially, Gases revenues increased one percent due to acquisitions. Operating income increased by $103 million. The prior quarter operating income included the Gases portion of the global cost reduction charge of $92 million. Other factors contributing to this improved profitability included higher volumes in the company's North American liquid bulk business and lower operating costs, including the benefits of plant closures announced last quarter. Electronics specialty materials volumes also continued to improve sequentially. Chemicals segment sales of $418 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year. Three-fourths of this increase was associated with base business growth and acquisitions, while the remainder was due to higher natural gas costs passed through contractually to customers, favorable currency effects and divestitures. Base business growth was led by improved volumes, principally in the company's chemicals intermediates businesses, as well as improved pricing in Performance Polymers (emulsions). Operating income of $29 million declined 30 percent versus the prior year, as higher volumes and favorable currency effects were more than offset by higher raw material, energy and plant costs. Sequentially, Chemicals revenues decreased one percent, principally due to seasonally lower sales of higher amines. Operating income increased by $59 million. The prior quarter included the Chemicals portion of the global cost reduction charge of $58 million. Equipment segment sales of $80 million increased 11 percent over the prior year on higher air separation plant sales, partially offset by lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger sales. As expected, the segment incurred a modest operating loss in the quarter, mainly due to reduced LNG sales and lower margins in other equipment product lines. Corporate and Other costs increased $17 million versus prior year. This reflected expenses associated with portfolio management activities in the current quarter and favorable adjustments recorded last year related to a divested business and an insurance settlement. Earnings for the quarter benefited from a reduction in the annual effective tax rate. This was principally due to favorable credits and adjustments and a lower than originally forecast profit before tax, resulting in a lower average rate. For fiscal 2003, Air Products' sales of $6.3 billion increased 17 percent. Two-thirds of this increase was associated with acquisitions and base business growth, while the remainder was due to higher natural gas costs passed through contractually to customers, favorable currency effects and divestitures. Improved volumes in Gases and Chemicals led the base business growth. Net income of $397 million included after tax charges of $96.6 million in the third quarter for the global cost reduction plan and $2.9 million in the first quarter for the cumulative effect of an accounting change. -more-
Commenting on these results, Mr. Jones said, "It was a challenging year. The programs we have implemented to improve our businesses were overshadowed by the weak manufacturing environment and high raw material and energy costs. Looking forward, we are confident that our growth strategies, market positions, operating leverage and continued capital discipline will improve profitability in fiscal 2004." Mr. Jones added, "While we're in the early stages of a recovery in most of our end markets, it's difficult to predict the pace at which manufacturing activity will improve. As a result, we are providing a guidance range for fiscal year 2004 EPS of $2.35 to $2.65. This includes an increase in estimated pension expense of approximately $.15 EPS. We expect fiscal first quarter EPS in the range of $.55 to $.59, which takes into account seasonally lower volumes in certain businesses, and anticipated plant maintenance expenses." Mr. Jones added that Air Products will continue to drive portfolio management and cost reduction actions, and noted that upfront costs associated with such actions could reduce Air Products' earnings outlook. Air Products (NYSE:APD) serves customers in technology, energy, healthcare and industrial markets worldwide with a unique portfolio of products, services and solutions, providing atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials and chemical intermediates. Founded in 1940, Air Products has built leading positions in key growth markets and is recognized for its innovative culture, operational excellence and commitment to safety and the environment.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (a) Included an after-tax net expense of $96.5, or $.43 per share, for global cost reduction plans. (b) Included an after-tax benefit of $3.0, or $.01 per share, for global cost reduction plans.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (Unaudited)
AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Reclassification The company changed its reporting for the global cost reduction plans to present the costs on a separate income statement line item within Operating Income. In 2003, the company recorded a net global cost reduction plan expense of $152.5, which was previously reflected in the income statement as follows: cost of sales $20.6, selling and administrative $34.1, research and development $2.1 and other expense $95.7. In 2002, the company recorded a net global cost reduction plan expense of $23.1, which was previously reflected in the income statement as follows: cost of sales $12.0, selling and administrative $10.8, and research and development $.3. Asset Retirement Obligations The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on 1 October 2002. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The company's asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Gases on-site long-term supply contracts under which the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. At 1 October 2002, the company recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is approximately $1. Acquisitions Acquisitions for the twelve months ended 30 September 2003, totaling $529.6, included Ashland's Electronic Chemicals Business, American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), additional small homecare businesses, and Sanwa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. On 29 August 2003, the company acquired the Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, a division of Ashland Inc., in a cash transaction valued at $295. Ashland's Electronic Chemicals business is a leading global electronic service provider and supplier of ultrapure specialty chemicals used by the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices. With annual revenues of approximately $200, the Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland has a global network of sales and marketing offices in North America, Europe and Asia. In October 2002, the company acquired AHS for $166. AHS is a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern United States. In July 2002, the company purchased an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. With this acquisition, the company obtained control and began to consolidate this investment. The acquisitions in 2003 and the San Fu acquisition in 2002 contributed $412 and $65 to sales and operating income, respectively, for the twelve months ended 30 September 2003.
Divestitures On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the assets sold generated revenues of approximately $100 with a modest contribution to operating income. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). On 1 April 2003, the company completed the sale of the majority of its Canadian packaged gas business to the BOC Group for approximately $40. 2003 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2003 included an expense of $152.7 ($96.6 after-tax, or $.43 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2003 Plan). This expense included $56.8 for severance and pension related benefits and $95.9 for asset disposals and facility closures in the Gases and Chemicals segments. The results for the period also included the reversal of the balance of the 2002 Plan accrual of $.2. During the third quarter of 2003, the company completed a capacity utilization analysis in several businesses in the Gases segment. To reduce capacity and costs, several facilities ceased operation as of 30 June 2003. An expense of $37.6 was recognized for the closure of these facilities, net of expected recovery from disposal. A decision was made to terminate several incomplete capacity expansion projects. An expense of $13.0 was recognized for the cost of terminating these projects, net of expected recovery from disposal and redeployment. An expense of $3.6 was also recognized for the planned sale of two real estate properties and the termination of several leases for small facilities. These expenses are principally in the North American merchant and tonnage businesses with a modest amount in our Electronics business. The rationalization of excess capacity in certain products resulted in a decision to exit certain Chemical Intermediates operations. Late in the quarter ended 30 June 2003, the company decided to pursue the sale of its European methylamines and derivatives business. The company expects to complete the sale by 30 June 2004. Expected proceeds from sale were determined and a loss was recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the assets and the expected net proceeds from the sales. Additional expenses for the closure of the methanol and ammonia plants in Pensacola, Florida, which make products for internal consumption, were also recognized. The total expense for these actions was $41.7. In addition to the capacity reduction initiatives, the company continues to implement cost reduction and productivity related efforts. The divestitures, the capacity reductions and the cost control initiatives will result in the elimination of 461 positions from the company. The company will complete the 2003 Plan by 30 June 2004. Approximately 30% of the position reductions relate to capacity rationalization and divestitures. An additional 40% relates to ongoing productivity efforts and balancing engineering resources with project activity and the remaining 30% relates to a reduction in the number of management positions. Cost savings from the 2003 global cost reduction plan in the fourth quarter of 2003 were approximately $3. Cost savings of $38 are expected in 2004. Beyond 2004, the company expects the 2003 global cost reduction plan to provide annualized incremental cost savings of $59, of which the majority is related to reduced personnel costs.
2002 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2002 included an expense of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2002 Plan) including U.S. packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in an expense of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. An expense of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. This cost reduction plan was completed as expected in March 2003. The results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2002 also included the reversal of the balance of the accrual for the 2001 Plan of $7.7 ($4.8 after-tax, or $.02 per share). Equity Affiliates' Income Income from equity affiliates for the three months ended 30 September 2003 included $9 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. $7 is included in Other equity affiliates and $2 is included in Gases equity affiliates. For the twelve months ended 30 September 2003, income from equity affiliates included $23 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. $15 is included in Other equity affiliates and $8 is included in Gases equity affiliates. Income Taxes The effective tax rates exclude minority interest. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2003 was 26.1% compared to 30.0% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. This decline was due to higher tax credits and adjustments. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended 30 September 2003 was 26.9% compared to 31.4% in the prior year. The effective tax rate was lower in 2003 due to higher tax credits and adjustments and the nondeductible costs included in the sale of the U.S. packaged gas business in 2002.

Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] News Release - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 04073 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EPS OF 58 CENTS Access the Q1 earnings teleconference scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on January 21 by calling (719) 457-2645 and entering passcode 686795, or listen on the Web: www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 21, 2004) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $132 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.58 for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. Net income increased five percent and diluted EPS was up $.02 compared with the prior year, which included a charge of $3 million or $.02 per share for the cumulative effect of an accounting change*. Sequentially, EPS was unchanged. Quarter revenues of $1,685 million were up 16 percent from the prior year on higher volumes in Gases and Chemicals, acquisitions and favorable currency effects. Sequentially, revenues increased three percent, driven by acquisitions and favorable currency effects. Operating income of $199 million was up two percent from the prior year and up six percent sequentially. EPS was unchanged from the prior year excluding the accounting change*. Higher volumes, favorable currency effects and a lower effective tax rate were offset by lower electronics prices, customer outages, higher pension and other costs, and favorable adjustments in the prior year related to incentive compensation and past divestitures of equity affiliates. John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We had solid performance in the first quarter. Our strategies and portfolio management actions are working, and we are encouraged by the progress we are seeing in many of our businesses." Gases segment sales of $1,204 million increased 17 percent over the prior year on higher volumes in the company's Electronics, Energy and Process Industries, and Healthcare businesses, favorable currency effects, and acquisitions. Operating income of $182 million increased nine percent, as positive volume, currency and acquisition effects were partially offset by higher costs. Sequentially, Gases revenues increased five percent, due to higher volumes, acquisitions and favorable currency effects, partially offset by lower natural gas costs contractually passed through to customers. Operating income increased by one percent on higher volumes. Chemicals segment sales of $410 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year on higher volumes across most of the company's Intermediates and Performance Materials businesses, as well as favorable currency effects. Operating income of $25 million declined 26 percent, as customer outages and higher raw material, energy and pension costs more than offset positive volume and currency effects. Sequentially, Chemicals revenues decreased two percent and operating income declined -more-
Page 2 of 9 17 percent on anticipated seasonally lower sales in several Performance Materials businesses, and Intermediates customer outages. Equipment segment revenues of $71 million increased six percent over the prior year on improved air separation unit sales. Operating income declined on lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger activity. Air Products received a new LNG heat exchanger order at the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "We are reaffirming our EPS guidance range of $2.35 to $2.65 for the year. Assuming the positive momentum we saw in the first quarter continues, we are more comfortable we can achieve the mid to upper end of this range. However, we remain cautious about higher raw material costs, economic growth in Europe, and the timing of equipment orders. We expect fiscal second quarter EPS in the range of $.58 to $.62." Mr. Jones added that Air Products will continue to drive portfolio management and cost reduction actions similar to prior years and noted upfront costs associated with such actions could reduce Air Products' earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. Air Products will host its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, January 22, 2004 at 2:00 p.m. ET. Access the audio Webcast at www.airproducts.com.

Page 7 of 9 AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) RECLASSIFICATION The company changed its reporting to now include overhead expenses incurred by the company related to equity affiliates in selling and administrative expense. Previously, these expenses related to equity affiliates were reported in the income statement line item for equity affiliates' income, net of related expenses. Equity affiliates' income now includes the company's proportionate share of earnings of the affiliates and the gain or loss on the sale of investments in equity affiliates. This reclassification impacts the Gases segment. The income statements of the prior periods were adjusted to reflect this reclassification. The impact on consolidated equity affiliates' income and selling and administrative expense for each of the last five years is summarized below. This reclassification for each of the fiscal 2003 quarters is as follows: first quarter - $2.5; second quarter - $2.7; third quarter - $2.7; and fourth quarter - - $2.1. FINANCING ACTIVITIES At 30 September 2003, the company's committed lines of credit totaled $600, maturing in January 2005. During the first quarter of 2004, the company replaced these commitments with a new $700 multicurrency revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2008. On 9 January 2004, the company filed a form S-3 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. When declared effective, the shelf registration will enable the company to issue up to $1 billion of debt and equity securities. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COSTS Operating income for the three months ended 31 December 2002 included a favorable adjustment of $8 for lower than anticipated payments of fiscal year 2002 incentive compensation costs. EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME Income from equity affiliates for the three months ended 31 December 2002 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. $8 is included in Other equity affiliates and $6 is included in Gases equity affiliates. -more-

EDITOR'S NOTE: *On October 1, 2002, Air Products adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, requiring that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. It applies to certain of Air Products' on-site agreements, for example, where the company has an obligation to remove its equipment upon expiration of a customer contract. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 million was recorded as the cumulative effect of the accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is negligible (approximately $1 million).

Access the teleconference slides at www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases/Teleconference.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 28, 2004) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $141 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.62 for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004. Net income increased 24 percent and diluted EPS was up 22 percent compared with the prior year. Sequentially, net income and EPS increased seven percent. Record quarter revenues of $1,857 million were up 18 percent from the prior year on stronger volumes across the company's Gases and Chemicals segments, acquisitions, and favorable currency effects. Sequentially, revenues increased 10 percent, driven by improved volumes and favorable currency effects. Operating income of $210 million was up 19 percent from the prior year and up six percent sequentially. John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "As the manufacturing environment continued to improve, we saw significant volume increases based on strong demand in our growth platforms and our ability to leverage our existing asset base." Gases segment sales of $1,285 million increased 14 percent over the prior year, mainly on higher volumes and acquisitions in the company's Electronics and Healthcare growth platforms, and favorable currency effects. Operating income of $189 million increased 26 percent, as operating leverage from improved asset loadings more than offset higher costs. Sequentially, Gases revenues increased seven percent, principally due to stronger volumes in Electronics and Energy and Process Industries. Operating income increased four percent as volume growth was partially offset by higher costs. Chemicals segment sales of $483 million increased 21 percent versus the prior year due to strong volume growth across the company's Performance Materials growth platform and base Intermediates businesses. Operating income of $35 million increased three percent, as higher volumes were largely offset by higher raw material and other costs. Sequentially, Chemicals revenues were up 18 percent and operating income increased 42 percent on expected seasonally stronger volumes and new business signings.
Equipment segment revenues of $89 million were up over the prior year on higher air separation unit sales. Operating income declined on lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger activity. Air Products received a new LNG heat exchanger order at the end of the second quarter. Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "Our solid volume gains during the first half of the year, coupled with improving manufacturing in North America and Asia, should improve earnings in the second half of our fiscal year. We are now projecting a full-year EPS range of $2.45 to $2.65 and a third fiscal quarter EPS range of $.63 to $.68." Mr. Jones continued, "Our continued earnings improvement is evidence that the strategies we embarked upon a few years ago are working and delivering value for Air Products' shareholders and customers. Our top line growth remains strong and our SAP project, an integral part of our productivity efforts, is on budget and on schedule." Air Products will continue to drive portfolio management and cost reduction actions similar to prior years. Upfront costs associated with such actions could reduce Air Products' projected earnings for the current fiscal year.

LITIGATION In the normal course of business, the company is occasionally involved in uninsured legal proceedings, including, in July 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronic Materials, LLC filed suit against the company alleging breach of contract resulting from the termination of a Strategic Alliance Agreement dated 1 October 1998 ("SAA"). The suit alleges that the company will source certain chemicals produced from its recently acquired Ashland Electronic Chemicals business rather than sourcing them from Honeywell. The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court seeking specific performance of the SAA and, in the alternative, a combination of specific performance and monetary damages up to $106. Trial was held during the week of 29 March 2004 and ended 2 April 2004. The company intends to continue its vigorous defense of this claim. No decision is expected until July or August 2004. The company has only established an accrual for the anticipated legal costs. Although management is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss or a range of loss, it believes that a judgment on damages will be significantly less than the damages sought. The company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay, if any, in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows, even though a future charge for any damage award could have a significant impact on the company's net income in the period in which it is recorded. 7

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 28, 2004)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $163 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.71 for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004. Results were up significantly from last year's net income of $27 million or $.12 per share, which included an after-tax charge of $96.6 million or $.43 per share for a global cost reduction plan. Excluding this charge, net income was up 32 percent* and EPS was up 29 percent.* Sequentially, net income and EPS increased 15 percent.
Quarter revenues of $1,893 million were up 16 percent from the prior year on strong Gases volumes including acquisitions in the company's Electronics and Healthcare businesses. Sequentially, revenues increased two percent, as improved Gases volumes were partially offset by lower Chemicals volumes. Operating income of $234 million was up 23 percent* excluding the prior year charge and up 11 percent sequentially, principally driven by volume gains.
John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our excellent results this quarter demonstrate that our people are executing our strategies. We are very pleased with our Gases performance, which posted strong volume gains delivering operating leverage to our bottom line. Also, for the second quarter in a row, our return on capital improved."
Gases segment sales of $1,338 million increased 18 percent over the prior year on higher volumes across the businesses. Record operating income of $213 million increased 26 percent* excluding the prior year charge. These results were generated by higher volumes in the company's Energy and Process Industries, Electronics, and Asian gas businesses. Volumes in both the North American and European merchant gas businesses also benefited from a pickup in manufacturing activity in these regions.
Chemicals segment sales of $453 million were up eight percent versus the prior year, primarily on volume growth in the company's Performance Materials business. Operating income of $30 million increased three percent excluding the prior year charge*, as positive volumes were largely offset by higher manufacturing costs.
 
Equipment segment revenues of $102 million increased over the prior year on higher air separation plant sales. Operating income of $5 million increased on higher air separation and liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger activity. Within the quarter, the company received its third LNG heat exchanger order for the fiscal year.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "Our outlook for the year is now $2.60 to $2.65the top end of our original guidance for the year. We are encouraged by our strong performance this quarter and the positive trends we are seeing in our markets. For example, within the last month, we announced new contracts supplying hydrogen to four major North American refineries and a doubling of our liquid capacity in southern China to support our leadership position there."
He continued, "Our highest priority is improving our return on capital. Our strong cash flow, growth platforms, operating leverage and productivity investments will deliver for our shareholders."
Air Products will continue to drive portfolio management and cost reduction actions similar to prior years. Upfront costs associated with such actions could reduce Air Products' projected earnings for the current fiscal year.

Global Cost Reduction Plans
The results for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2003 included a charge of $152.7 ($96.6 after-tax, or $.43 per share) for the 2003 global cost reduction plan. This charge included $56.8 for severance and pension-related benefits and $95.9 for asset disposals and facility closures in the Gases and Chemicals segments. The results for the nine months ended 30 June 2003 also included the reversal of the balance of the accrual for the 2002 Plan of $.2.
The 2003 plan was completed as expected in June 2004 with the exception of the planned sale of the company's European methylamines and derivatives business (EM&D). In April 2004, the company announced the proposed sale of this business, which is pending regulatory approval.
Equity Affiliates' Income
Income from equity affiliates for the nine months ended 30 June 2003 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. $8 is included in Other equity affiliates and $6 is included in Gases equity affiliates.
Income Taxes
The company had a net tax benefit of $2.9 for the three months ended 30 June 2003. The net benefit was driven by the impact of the 2003 global cost reduction plan charges, which were taxed at statutory rates.
Litigation
In the normal course of business, the company is occasionally involved in uninsured legal proceedings, including, in July 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronic Materials, LLC filed suit against the company alleging breach of contract resulting from the termination of a Strategic Alliance Agreement dated 1 October 1998 ("SAA"). The suit alleges that the company will source certain chemicals produced from its recently acquired Ashland Electronic Chemicals business rather than sourcing them from Honeywell. The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court seeking specific performance of the SAA and, in the alternative, a combination of specific performance and monetary damages up to $106. Trial was held during the week of 29 March 2004 and ended 2 April 2004. The company intends to continue its vigorous defense of this claim. A decision is expected before the end of August 2004. In fiscal year 2003, the company established an accrual for this litigation. The results for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2004 included an additional charge for this matter. There is a possibility that resolution of this matter could result in an additional loss in excess of presently established accruals. Although management is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any additional loss, it believes that a judgment on damages will be significantly less than the damages sought.
The company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay, if any, in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows, even though a future additional charge for any damage could have a significant impact on the company's net income in the period in which it is recorded.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 27, 2004)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $168 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.73 for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. Net income increased 28 percent and diluted EPS increased 26 percent over the prior year.
Record quarter revenues of $1,978 million were up 20 percent from the prior year on strong Gases volumes, particularly in the company's growth businesses. Sequentially, revenues increased four percent on improved Gases and Chemicals volumes. Operating income of $237 million was up 27 percent versus the prior year and one percent sequentially, principally driven by volume gains.
Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "This was another solid quarter, as our growth businesses delivered strong volume performance. Our return on capital improved as we continued to load our existing asset base."
Gases segment sales of $1,396 million increased 22 percent over the prior year on higher volumes across the businesses, particularly electronics, refinery hydrogen, healthcare and Asia. Record operating income of $216 million increased 20 percent, driven mainly by strong volumes, favorable currency effects and acquisitions.
Sequentially, gases revenues increased four percent due to stronger volume performance, mainly in electronics and refinery hydrogen. Operating income was up one percent as volume gains were partially offset by higher operating costs.
Chemicals segment sales of $483 million were up 16 percent versus the prior year, primarily on strong volumes across the businesses. But higher raw material and manufacturing costs offset these gains, with operating income down nine percent to $27 million.
Sequentially, chemicals revenues increased seven percent, mainly on higher volumes in polyurethane intermediates and epoxy additives. Operating income was down 10 percent.
 
Equipment segment revenues of $99 million increased 24 percent over the prior year on higher air separation plant and liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger sales. Operating income also increased on higher LNG activity.
For fiscal 2004, Air Products' sales of $7.4 billion increased 18 percent. Approximately half of this increase was associated with higher volumes, while the remainder was principally due to acquisitions and favorable currency effects. Net income of $604 million was up 22 percent* and diluted EPS of $2.64 was up 19 percent* excluding last year's global cost reduction charge.
Reflecting on the year, Jones said, "We built our positions serving growth markets and geographies, further improved our portfolio, strengthened our customer relationships and drove up return on capital. We also set the foundation for improving our productivity by bringing more than 70 percent of our businesses onto SAP and driving continuous improvement efforts."
"We anticipate another solid year of improvement in 2005, driven by a step-change in productivity and modest global economic growth, which will help us load our existing asset base and further improve our return on capital. In Gases, we expect continued growth in our electronics, refinery hydrogen, healthcare and Asian businesses. We know we must fix our Chemicals business, and we are committed to delivering significant margin improvements through pricing actions and managing our raw material costs. And in Equipment, we expect improved performance from stronger LNG demand. Given this outlook, we are providing a fiscal 2005 guidance range of $2.90 to $3.10, which includes an estimated $.10 to $.15 of costs associated with achieving our increased productivity targets."
Jones added that Air Products expects fiscal 2005 first quarter EPS in the range of $.67 to $.70, up 16 to 21 percent from $.58 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Equity Affiliates' Income
In July 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronic Materials, LLC filed suit against the company alleging breach of contract resulting from the termination of a Strategic Alliance Agreement dated 1 October 1998 ("SAA"). On 6 August 2004, the Delaware Chancery Court decided that the company must pay damages in the amount of $8.1. This amount was recorded against previously established accruals. Honeywell has filed a notice of appeal of the Court's decision, and the company has filed a cross-appeal. The company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay, if any, in connection with this matter would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

www.airproducts.com/Invest/financialnews/EarningsReleases.htm.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 26, 2005)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $167 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.72 for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004. Net income increased 27 percent and diluted EPS was up 24 percent compared with the prior year.
Record quarter revenues of $1,991 million were up 18 percent from the prior year on strong volumes across the Gases and Chemicals businesses. Operating income of $238 million was up 20 percent from the prior year. Strong volume increases across all businesses, favorable currency effects and productivity gains were partially offset by higher costs for raw materials and productivity initiatives.
John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We again delivered strong earnings on solid volume gains and generated robust cash flow in the quarter. The strength of our portfolio, particularly our leadership positions in our growth businesses, is producing higher earnings and improved returns. Our employees remain focused and continue to make good progress toward our number one priorityimproving our return on capital."
Record Gases segment sales of $1,443 million increased 20 percent over the prior year on strong volumesparticularly in the company's refinery hydrogen and electronics growth businessesas well as higher natural gas cost pass through to customers and favorable currency effects. Record operating income of $220 million increased 21 percent, driven by strong volumes and favorable currency effects.
Chemicals segment sales of $461 million increased 12 percent versus the prior year on strong volumes in the Performance Materials and most Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Operating income of $20 million declined 18 percent, as higher raw material costs and plant operating costs associated with plant turnarounds more than offset stronger volumes and higher prices.
Equipment segment revenues of $88 million increased 23 percent over the prior year, mainly on higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger sales. Operating income of $6 million was up significantly versus the prior year. During the quarter, the company received two additional AP-X LNG heat exchanger orders, a new, proprietary technology that can increase heat exchanger capacity by 50 percent.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "With our relentless focus on shareholder value, we continue to load our existing asset base while delivering a step change in our productivity and maintaining strict capital discipline. Although our Chemicals group results this quarter
 
are unacceptable, we expect significant improvement in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. Our first quarter typically is the seasonal low point, and we now have some raw material fixes in place and several announced price increases which should help drive sequential improvement in Chemicals."
"Based on our improved first quarter performance and our confidence in our ability to sustain it, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. For the fiscal second quarter, we expect to grow between 18 and 26 percent, resulting in an EPS of $.73 to $.78."

Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] News Release Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EPS OF $.75 Access the Q2 earnings teleconference scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on April 27 by calling (719) 457-2625 and entering passcode 3026254, or listen on the web: www.airproducts.com/Invest/financialnews/EarningsReleases.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 27, 2005) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $175 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.75 for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005. Net income increased 24 percent and diluted EPS was up 21 percent compared with the prior year. Record quarter revenues of $2,003 million were up eight percent over the prior year, driven mainly by higher volumes across the Gases segment and higher pricing in Chemicals. Operating income of $252 million was up 20 percent from the prior year, principally driven by volume gains and lower costs from ongoing productivity projects. John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "This is the fifth consecutive quarter we improved our return on capital and posted a greater than 20 percent earnings per share increase. Strong volume gains in Gases and Equipment coupled with significant improvement in our Chemicals business produced those results. By loading our assets and delivering on productivity commitments, we increased our operating margin to 12.6 percent. We also generated strong cash flows, announced a $500 million share repurchase program and increased our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year." Gases segment sales of $1,412 million increased 10 percent over the prior year. Increased volumes in North America and Asia base gases, refinery hydrogen, electronics and homecare contributed six percent of the growth, while favorable currency and homecare acquisitions contributed the remainder. Operating income of $207 million increased nine percent over the prior year, driven by higher volumes. Chemicals segment sales of $499 million were up three percent versus the prior year on improved pricing to recover higher raw material and energy costs, offset by the impact of divestitures within the past year. Operating income of $45 million increased 30 percent over the prior year on lower costs and improved pricing. Equipment segment revenues of $93 million rose four percent over the prior year, mainly on higher LNG sales. Operating income of $8 million was significantly higher. In addition, the company recently announced two new orders for its proprietary AP-X(TM) LNG heat exchangers, bringing the year-to-date total to four. -more-
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "We still expect continued volume gains during our second half, particularly in our refinery hydrogen, equipment and homecare businesses, despite general concerns about slowing growth in manufacturing. We will continue to focus on productivity as well as pricing improvements to address increases in raw material and energy costs." The company projects a full-year EPS range of $3.00 to $3.15 and a third fiscal quarter EPS range of $.77 to $.82. Air Products (NYSE:APD) serves customers in technology, energy, healthcare and industrial markets worldwide with a unique portfolio of products, services and solutions, providing atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials and chemical intermediates.

Factors that might cause forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results include those specifically referenced as future events or outcomes that the company anticipates, as well as, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services during that time; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; uninsured litigation judgments or settlements; spikes in the pricing of natural gas; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; charges related to currently unplanned portfolio management and cost reduction actions; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; the impact of new financial accounting standards, including the expensing of employee stock options; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS In the financial statements for the first six months of 2005, the company has applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for employee stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," which requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of stock options for interim periods beginning after 15 June 2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the compliance date to fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005. The company is planning to adopt SFAS No. 123R on 1 October 2005 and restate prior periods. LITIGATION In July 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronics Materials, LLC ("Honeywell") filed suit against the company alleging breach of contract resulting from the termination of a strategic alliance agreement dated 1 October 1998. On 6 August 2004, the Delaware Chancery Court decided that the company must pay damages in the amount of $8.1. The amount was recorded against previously established accruals. Honeywell filed an appeal of the court's decision and the company filed a cross appeal. On 29 March 2005, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Chancery Court opinion in part and reversed in part, ruling that Honeywell was entitled to a recalculation of the award based upon five years of damages versus two years used for the 6 August 2004 judgment. On 13 April 2005, the company filed a motion with the Delaware Supreme Court to reconsider the ruling. The company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with this matter will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 27, 2005)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $191 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.82 for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005. Net income increased 17 percent and diluted EPS was up 15 percent compared with the prior year.
Record revenues of $2,078 million were up 10 percent over the prior year on strong performance across the Gases, Chemicals and Equipment segments. Operating income of $263 million was up 12 percent from the prior year, principally driven by continued improvement in Chemicals and Equipment.
John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We delivered significant improvements in sales, earnings and return on capital this quarter. Volumes in our Gases businesses were strong, and the turnaround in our Chemicals segment continued as we successfully managed volume, price and cost. In addition, we have essentially completed our $500 million share buyback program, reflecting our commitment to improve shareholder returns."
Gases segment sales of $1,479 million were up 11 percent over the prior year, principally on a volume increase of seven percent. Volumes were up in almost all businesses with the largest gains in Electronics, Asia and North American liquid bulk. Operating income of $211 million decreased one percent from the prior year, as volume increases were offset by lower electronics pricing, higher plant maintenance spending, productivity implementation costs, and higher power and fuel expenses.
Chemicals segment sales of $482 million were up seven percent over the prior year, largely due to increased pricing to recover higher raw material costs. Continuing the recovery from the second quarter, operating income of $49 million was up 64 percent over the prior year, due to improved prices and productivity.
Equipment segment revenues of $117 million rose 15 percent over the prior year and operating income of $11 million increased significantly. Higher LNG activity drove both the revenue and operating income increase.
 
This quarter, the company secured another AP-X LNG heat exchanger order, the fifth this fiscal year, and won a contract to supply a new large air separation facility for the gas-to-liquids market. Equipment backlog is at a record $624 million.
Earnings this quarter also benefited from a lower tax rate resulting from the company's ongoing tax strategies.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said the company expects full year EPS of $3.10 to $3.15. He added, "We posted strong double-digit earnings growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we have contracts in hand that will drive future growth. For example, our energy business continues to be the leading supplier of hydrogen to refineries and proprietary LNG heat exchanger technology around the world. We currently are building five new hydrogen plants for eight baseload customers which will expand our capacity 35 percent. These plants will come onstream in 2006. We also have orders for 10 LNG heat exchangers which will drive further improvements in our Equipment segment in 2006.
"At the same time, our team remains focused on driving productivity, loading assets, and maintaining capital discipline to continue to improve our return on capital."

In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the compliance date to fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
Share-Based Payments
In July 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronics Materials, LLC ("Honeywell") filed suit against the company alleging breach of contract resulting from the termination of a strategic alliance agreement dated 1 October 1998. On 6 August 2004, the Delaware Chancery Court decided that the company must pay damages in the amount of $8.1. The amount was recorded against previously established accruals. Honeywell filed an appeal of the court's decision and the company filed a cross appeal. On 29 March 2005, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Chancery Court opinion in part and reversed in part, ruling that Honeywell was entitled to a recalculation of the award based upon five years of damages versus two years used for the 6 August 2004 judgment. On 13 April 2005, the company filed a motion with the Delaware Supreme Court to reconsider the ruling. On 12 May 2005, the Delaware Supreme Court denied the request to reconsider its earlier ruling; the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's 29 March 2005 opinion. The trial court, at a hearing on 15 July 2005, ruled that it will hold a damages hearing on this matter later this year. The company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with this matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Exhibit 99.1
7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., August 31, 2005  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today announced that extensive damage caused by Hurricane Katrina has impacted the company's industrial gas complex in New Orleans, La.
Right now, Air Products' primary focus is on the safety and welfare of its employees in the area. The company will continue to work with local emergency responders as the impact of Hurricane Katrina is assessed and actions are taken to recover from it.
Although the full extent of the damage to the New Orleans production facilities is unknown at this time, the company will be working to bring operations back on line safely. Restart of the plant will be largely dependent on the availability of power, utilities, communications, other infrastructure access, and the extent of the damage.
Based on initial assessments, damage from the hurricane will affect Air Products' ability to supply customers with hydrogen from the New Orleans plant for an extended period of time. In addition, the company's liquid hydrogen production facility at Sarnia, Canada, Ontario will be experiencing a scheduled shutdown due to a temporary suspension of its supplier's feedgas plant. As a result, the company has declared force majeure for liquid hydrogen at these two industrial gas locations.
In these extraordinary circumstances, Air Products is actively working to assist customers with their supply needs, including obtaining product from other sources and geographies. Communications with all customers are underway.
Air Products (NYSE:APD) serves customers in technology, energy, healthcare and industrial markets worldwide with a unique portfolio of products, services and solutions, providing atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials and chemical intermediates. Founded in 1940, Air Products has built leading positions in key growth markets such as semiconductor materials, refinery hydrogen, home healthcare services, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives. The company is recognized for its innovative culture, operational excellence and commitment to safety and the environment and is listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability and FTSE4Good Indices.

Exhibit 99.1 [LOGO AIR PRODUCTS] News Release -------------------------------------------------------------- Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 AIR PRODUCTS ANNOUNCES EXPECTED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF RECENT HURRICANES, AND OCTOBER 26th FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS AND TELECONFERENCE INFORMATION LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (September 27, 2005) - Today, Air Products (NYSE:APD) announced it currently anticipates the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to its business operations will result in an unfavorable fiscal fourth quarter impact in the range of $.05 to $.07 per share. The losses are attributable to property damage and business interruption in both its gases and chemicals businesses. In accordance with the company's accounting policies, these impacts only reflect expected insurance recovery for certain property damage costs and do not reflect any expected insurance recovery for business interruption. On August 31, 2005, Air Products declared force majeure regarding liquid hydrogen from New Orleans and Sarnia--plants which represent approximately 90 percent of the company's liquid hydrogen production in North America. The company's New Orleans, Louisiana industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. The company's Sarnia, Ontario, Canada production facility was originally shut down due to a planned suspension of a supplier's feedgas when the hurricane hit the New Orleans facility. The Sarnia plant has resumed partial operations, relieving but not mitigating, the shortage. The New Orleans facility should begin operations within the coming months, with substantial operations anticipated by the end of the calendar year. Most recently, the company's production sites in Texas and Louisiana weathered Hurricane Rita well with only minor damage. Most plants shut down prior to the storm have been restarted and are on-line, with the remaining plants expected to resume production as power and other utilities are restored. However, the general disruption to the area's petrochemical system will have a short-term impact to Air Products. The company will release its fiscal fourth quarter earnings and fiscal 2006 guidance on Wednesday, October 26, 2005. The company will review these results later that day in a teleconference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The teleconference will be open to the public and the media in listen-only mode by telephone and Internet broadcast.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 26, 2005)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $179 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.79 for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005. Net income increased six percent and diluted EPS was up eight percent compared with the prior year.
Revenues of $2,071 million were up five percent over the prior year on higher raw material and energy cost contractual pass-throughs and improved Chemicals pricing. Higher Gases and Equipment volumes were offset by lower Chemical volumes.
The impact of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita reduced revenues in the quarter by approximately two percent. The hurricanes reduced operating income in the quarter by $20 million ($13 million in Gases and $7 million in Chemicals), or six cents per share.
For fiscal 2005, sales of $8.1 billion were up 10 percent and net income of $712 million was up 18 percent. Diluted EPS of $3.08 was up 17 percent. This strong performance was driven by higher Gases volumes, improved Chemicals pricing and strong Equipment performance, particularly in LNG.
John P. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We performed well in the quarter despite three hurricanes and dramatic increases in energy prices. Our employees, with their focused and rapid response, returned plants to service as quickly as possible, innovatively sourced product, and overcame many logistical problems to minimize disruption to our customers. As a result of these exceptional efforts, we continued to deliver improved results for our shareholders and for the seventh consecutive quarter improved our return on capital."
Gases segment sales of $1,491 million were up seven percent over the prior year on higher volumes in Electronics, Asia and North America Gases, as well as higher natural gas cost contractual pass-throughs to customers. Operating income of $205 million decreased five percent from the prior year, as higher volumes were offset by higher operating costs, including the impacts of the recent hurricanes, and lower Electronics pricing.
Chemicals segment sales of $476 million declined two percent over the prior year, largely due to lower volumes and divestituresContinuing the recovery seen in prior quarters, operating income of $43 million was up 59 percent over the prior year from increased pricing to recover higher raw material and energy costs. These results also included revenues from a
.
 
polyurethane intermediates customer contract termination and a charge resulting from a decision to exit the company's fertilizer business.
Equipment segment revenues of $104 million rose five percent over the prior year and operating income of $20 million increased significantly. Higher LNG activity drove both the revenue and operating income increase. This quarter, the company secured two new traditional LNG heat exchanger orders, bringing the equipment backlog to a record $652 million.
2006 Outlook
Reflecting on the year, Jones said, "Our strategies paid off in fiscal 2005, as we posted significant improvements in sales, earnings and return on capital. Despite the impact of several unprecedented natural disasters, soaring energy and raw material costs, and pricing pressure in Electronics, we delivered on our commitments and positioned ourselves for further improvement in 2006.
"We have a significant amount of growth already under contract for next year. Some examples are the six hydrogen plants we are bringing on line, the 11 LNG heat exchangers we have in backlog, and the new contracts we have secured to supply Electronics customers in Asia."
The company will be adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R and begin expensing stock options in fiscal 2006. The estimated impact to diluted EPS is $.13.
The company currently anticipates fiscal year 2006 EPS of $3.25 to $3.45 per share, including the $.13 accounting change noted above. This guidance includes continued business interruption costs resulting from the hurricanes offset by insurance recoveries. The company's forecast for worldwide manufacturing growth is approximately three percent. In the first quarter, the company expects continued negative impact on the U.S. economy from the hurricanes, which should be offset by stronger growth in the second half of the year due to rebuilding efforts.
For the first quarter, earnings per share are expected to be between $.75 and $.79 including a $.03 stock option expense, as the negative impact of the hurricanes and seasonal declines in Chemicals should be more than offset by growth in Gases volumes, continued good performance for Equipment, and insurance recoveries.

Share-Based Payments
In accounting for its stock option plans for the year ended 30 September 2005, the company has applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for employee stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," which requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of stock options for interim periods beginning after 15 June 2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the compliance date to fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005. The company will adopt this Statement on 1 October 2005. The estimated impact to diluted earnings per share is approximately $.13 in 2006.
Hurricanes
As a result of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita, the company incurred losses attributable to property damage and business interruption in both its gases and chemicals businesses. The company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. This facility should return to substantial operations by the end of the calendar year. The quarter ended 30 September 2005 included a charge of $20, or $.06 per share on a diluted basis, for the hurricane related losses. This charge only reflects expected insurance recoveries for certain property damage costs and does not reflect any insurance recovery for business interruption. A receivable of $14.6 has been recorded for the expected insurance recovery, principally the net book value of the damaged property. Claims will be filed with the insurance carriers as the required information is completed. Insurance recoveries will be recognized for business interruption and property claims in excess of the net book value of assets damaged as claims are settled.
Contract Termination
Effective July 2005, a major customer in the chemicals business terminated their contract for the purchase of toluene diamine. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized the present value of the termination payments required under the supply contract. As a result of the contract termination, operating income included an additional $16.
Chemicals' Fertilizer Business
The company decided to exit the fertilizer business at the completion of its current contractual commitments. The fourth quarter included a charge of $7.6, principally for the acceleration of depreciation due to the shortened useful life of plant and equipment.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
     On November 9, 2005, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") issued 300,000,000 Eurobonds with a 3.75% coupon and a maturity date of 8 November 2013 (the "Bonds"). Interest accrues from 9 November 2005 and is payable annually in arrears on 8 November of each year beginning 8 November 2006. Payments of interest and principal will be made in Euros. Deutsche Bank AG London Branch serves as fiscal agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. serves as listing agent and Luxembourg paying agent for the Bonds.
     A portion of the Bonds was exchanged for approximately 146,500,000 million of the Company's outstanding 6.5% Eurobonds due 2007 (the "Exchange Transaction") and the remainder was offered for cash (the "Cash Transaction"). The net proceeds of the Bonds issued in the Cash Transaction, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, equal 141,078,000, and will be used for general corporate purposes.
     The Bonds are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange; they are not, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Bonds have been offered outside the United States and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
     The Bonds constitute direct general obligations of the Company ranking among themselves with all other present and future unsecured obligations of the Company (expect for obligations that may be preferred by provisions of the law that are both mandatory and of general application). The Bonds are subject to redemption in whole either (i) at 100% of principal, at the Company's option at any time, in the event of certain changes affecting taxation in the United States of America or (ii) at a premium, at the Company's option at any time.
pari passu
     All terms and conditions of the Bonds as well as a description of the Cash Transaction are set forth in a prospectus dated 7 November 2005 and all terms and conditions of the Exchange Transaction are set forth in an exchange offer memorandum dated 20 October 2005 (collectively, the "Offering Circulars"). The Offering Circulars set forth, among other things, customary events of default, including failure to pay interest or principal, acceleration of the public indebtedness (any bonds, notes or commercial paper listed on any stock exchange or traded in the conventional public markets in the United States) of the Company or under a Company guarantee of public indebtedness if such indebtedness exceeds two percent (2%) of Company's shareholders' equity set forth in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K; certain failures to perform other obligations regarding the Notes or under the fiscal agency agreement; and certain cases of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In general, if an event of default occurs and is continuing, a Bond may be declared due and payable by its holder.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 25, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $181 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.80 for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005. Net income increased eight percent and diluted EPS was up eleven percent compared with the prior year.
First quarter earnings comparisons are affected by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R and expensing of stock options as of October 1, 2005. On a comparable basis (including stock compensation expenses), net income increased 13 percent* and diluted EPS increased 16 percent*.
Revenues of $2,099 million were up five percent over the prior year on higher natural gas and raw material cost contractual pass-throughs to customers, volume growth in Gases, and improved pricing in Chemicals. Operating income of $252 million was up 11 percent* from the prior year, primarily on strong Gases volumes and higher Equipment activity.
Discussion of Fiscal First Quarter Results on a Comparable Basis:
Unfavorable currency impacted sales growth by two percent in the quarter, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the prior quarter also reduced revenues by an additional three percent. The hurricanes reduced operating income in the quarter by $20 million ($14 million in Gases and $6 million in Chemicals), or $.06 per share.
John P. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We had a strong first quarter with continued growth in sales, earnings and most importantly, return on capital. We delivered these results despite significant challenges from the hurricanes and large spikes in raw material and energy costs. Our people executed well against the objectives we set for the quarter. A major driver in these results is our continued success in delivering productivity to the bottom line. We also saw continued volume growth in our Gases business and high activity in our Equipment business, driven by liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers."
Gases segment sales of $1,562 million were up eight percent over the prior year on higher volumes in the company's Asian base Gases business, stronger pricing in North America base Gases, as well as higher natural gas cost contractual pass-throughs to customers. Operating income of $229 million increased eight percent* from the prior year on strong volumes across most businesses and a gain on a European land sale, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the hurricanes.
Chemicals segment sales of $444 million declined four percent over the prior year, largely due to lower volumes, principally in polyurethane intermediates, and a divestiture. Chemicals operating income of $19 million was up nine percent* over the prior year on increased pricing to recover higher raw material, energy and natural gas costs.
Equipment segment revenues of $92 million rose five percent over the prior year and operating income of $16 million was up significantly, driven by continued high LNG heat exchanger activity. The company has 11 LNG heat exchangers in its Equipment backlog of $690 million.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "We are off to a good start for 2006, and we're encouraged by our momentum going forward. We successfully managed the impacts of the hurricanes, have a great backlog of projects to drive top-line growth, and are confident our productivity efforts will continue to deliver improved return on capital. As a result, we are increasing our EPS guidance to a range of $3.30 to $3.48 per share."
Outlook
For the second quarter, the company expects earnings per share between $.84 and $.87.
Air Products will host its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, January 26, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. ET. Access the audio Webcast at www.airproducts.com/Invest/shareholdersvcs/annualmeeting_materials.htm.

Please review the attached financial tables, including the Summary of Consolidated Financial Information:
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior year results have not been restated.
*This press release contains non-GAAP measures, which adjust prior year results to include the pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options based on previous footnote disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. Stock options have been accounted for as equity instruments. See the discussion under Share-Based Payments in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the company's management uses internally to evaluate the company's baseline performance.

(Millions of dollars, except for share data)
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior to 1 October 2005, the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options, as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The estimated impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R in 2006, based on the treatment of stock options as equity instruments, is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.13. The pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options in 2005 would have been a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $.13 for the year based on the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
Share-Based Payments
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires a change in accounting for awards granted on or after 1 October 2005 to accelerate expense to the retirement eligible date for individuals who meet the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon their retirement. The impact of this change in 2006 for all share-based compensation programs is estimated to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.03, principally related to the stock option program.
The company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in 2006 includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to 1 October 2005, and amortization related to new awards granted after 1 October 2005.
Because certain of the company's share-based compensation programs include a provision for a contingent cash settlement in the event of a change in control, the carrying amount of these awards based on a grant-date fair value has been presented separately in the balance sheet outside of shareholders' equity. The company believes the likelihood of such an actual cash settlement is remote. Accordingly, the company has accounted for its stock options as equity instruments in accordance with the proposed Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) No. 123R)-d issued by the FASB on 16 January 2006.
(
Under SFAS No. 123R as written, however, the company's stock options are considered liabilities due to the contingent cash settlement provision. Treatment of stock options as liability instruments would require the company to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in net income to reflect the fair value of all outstanding options as of 1 October 2005 on an after-tax basis. These awards would have to be remeasured to fair value at each subsequent financial statement date until the awards are settled. The impact of the cumulative effect adjustment would be estimated at approximately $295 on an after-tax basis, and the subsequent fair value adjustment for the first quarter of 2006 would be estimated as an additional expense of approximately $70 before-tax ($40 after-tax).
The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements, whether classified as equity or liability instruments, is a noncash charge. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. This facility should return to full operations by the end of the second quarter. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region, also, sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005. During the quarter ended 31 December 2005, the company received $25 representing partial settlement with its insurers. Additional insurance recoveries for property damages and business interruption will be recognized as claims are settled. The quarter ended 31 December 2005 included a net charge of $20.2, or $.06 per share on a diluted basis, principally for losses attributable to business interruption.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
Air Products will host a teleconference on this announcement today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.*
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (March 22, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE: APD) today announced a series of strategic initiatives to strengthen and expand its growth platforms, improve its return on capital and return value to its shareholders.
The company is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses, restructuring its Polyurethane Intermediates business, including plans to sell its dinitrotoluene (DNT) facility in Geismar, La., for $155 million, and investing in its Performance Materials business with the $115 million acquisition of specialty surfactants producer Tomah Products. These actions will enable the company to further sharpen its focus on its four growth platforms: Energy and Process Industries, Electronics, Homecare, and Performance Materials, as well as its position in the Asia region. The company also is accelerating its return of cash to shareholders through a $1.5 billion share repurchase program and an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.34.

John Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "The initiatives we have announced today are consistent with our growth strategy and reflect the discipline of our ongoing portfolio management process. These actions will make Air Products a more focused, less cyclical, and higher growth company.
"When these actions are completed, our growth businesses will make up over 60 percent of our overall annual revenues, up from just 35 percent in 2000. We are convinced that this new profile, combined with our number one priority to improve our return on capital, will deliver significant shareholder value going forward. I would like to commend and thank our employees who have improved the chemicals businesses through some very challenging times."
Air Products is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the company's ongoing portfolio management activities.
Exploring Sale of Amines and Polymers Businesses
"We have significantly improved our Amines and Polymers businesses over the past few years. However, additional investment in these businesses doesn't fit with our strategic direction. Potential buyers have expressed interest and we believe now is the right time to explore all opportunities," according to Jones. "For the right owner, these are very attractive investments. However, we will only sell these businesses to a buyer who recognizes their value."
The Amines business generated approximately $300 million in revenues in FY2005. Amines production facilities are located in Pace, Fla.; St. Gabriel, La.; and Camaari, Brazil. The consolidated Air Products Polymers joint venture with Wacker Chemie AG of Germany had approximately $550 million in FY2005 revenues with six manufacturing facilities including South Brunswick, N.J.; Piedmont, S.C.; Calvert City, Ky.; Elkton, Md.; Ulsan, Korea; and Kln, Germany. Goldman Sachs is acting as the financial adviser to Air Products in connection with the potential sale of these businesses, which will be subject to Air Products' Board of Directors and regulatory approval.
As part of its Polyurethane Intermediates business restructuring, Air Products announced that it has reached an agreement in principle to sell its DNT production facility in Geismar, La., to BASF Corporation for $155 million. The transaction has received regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of the month, subject to finalization of documents.
Agreement in Principle to Sell Geismar DNT Facility to BASF Corporation
The plant is located on property leased to Air Products at BASF's major manufacturing site in Geismar. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location are not included in this proposed transaction and will continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas for BASF and other customers. This transaction does not include Air Products' Pasadena, Texas, polyurethane intermediates facility, which continues to operate.
Air Products has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Tomah Products of Milton, Wis., for approximately $115 million in cash. With sales of $73 million in 2005, Tomah produces specialty surfactants and processing aids primarily for growth segments of the institutional and industrial cleaning, mining and oil field industries, among others. The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of March.
Acquisition of Tomah

Products to Capitalize on Surface Science Expertise and High Growth Market Opportunities

Through a commercial and product development relationship formed in 2004, Air Products and Tomah have been developing customized offerings for high growth segments of their target markets that benefit from the unique combinations of the companies' technologies. These offerings are increasingly attractive for customers seeking environmental and productivity benefits. The Tomah acquisition reflects Air Products' Performance Materials strategy to expand its presence in profitable market segments where it can build on its surface science expertise. Tomah's product lines, production capabilities and market channels support this strategy.

www.airproducts.com/PressRoom/AboutAirProducts/Backgrounders/tomah3.htm
In addition to specialty surfactants, Air Products' Performance Materials growth platform, with sales of approximately $570 million in FY2005, includes epoxy and polyurethane additives, specialty amines and advanced materials. These formulated products are sold based on performance characteristics that provide unique solutions for customers. They use proprietary technology based on Air Products' advanced surface and material science capabilities, and are sold into multiple targeted end use markets worldwide. They have consistently produced strong growth and sustainable returns above their cost of capital.
The Board of Directors of Air Products approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The new program is in addition to a prior $500 million program approved and completed in 2005, and will allow the company to repurchase shares at its discretion while investing in its businesses and growth opportunities. The company expects to begin buying back shares after the Q2 FY2006 earnings announcement and to complete $500 million of that repurchase before calendar year end.
Share Repurchase Program
The Board of Directors also raised the quarterly dividend on the company's stock to $0.34 per share from $0.32. This six percent increase represents the 24 consecutive annual increase in the company's dividend. The dividend is payable on May 7, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 3, 2006.
Increased Dividend
th
"Air Products continues to take steps to return cash to our shareholders while investing strategically in our growth businesses to further build our leadership positions," Jones said. "All of the actions we have announced today reflect the company's strong financial position, driven by our stable business models, capital discipline and the growth markets and geographies we serve."
The company said it did not expect any impact on its previous FY2006 EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.48 per share, excluding the one-time impact of transactional and restructuring-related gains and losses.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 26, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $204 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.89 for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006. Net income increased 16 percent and diluted EPS was up 19 percent compared with the prior year.
Second quarter earnings comparisons are affected by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R and expensing of stock options as of October 1, 2005. On a comparable basis (including stock compensation expenses), net income increased 21 percent and diluted EPS increased 24 percent. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release. The following discussion of second quarter results is on a comparable basis.
Revenues of $2,317 million were up 16 percent over the prior year on strong volume growth in Gases and Equipment. Operating income of $295 million was up 22 percent from the prior year, primarily on improved results in all segments driven by strong sales in Gases and Equipment and improved pricing in Chemicals.
John P. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Strong growth in the second quarter again delivered a double digit earnings increase and improved return on capital. During the quarter, we announced repositioning plans for our Chemicals Group. Consistent with those plans, we completed the sale of our Geismar Polyurethane Intermediates facility and the acquisition of Tomah Products to strengthen our Performance Materials growth platform. Actions like these, coupled with our improving performance, are transforming Air Products to a higher growth, less cyclical and more focused company."
3
Gases segment sales of $1,644 million were up 16 percent over the prior year on higher volumes in Electronics, EPI and global merchant gases. Operating income of $229 million increased 15 percent from the prior year on strong volumes, particularly in Electronics, improved pricing in North America, and gains from hurricane insurance recovery. The net hurricane impact was positive to operating income in the quarter by $15 million or $.04 per share. These improvements were partially offset by higher costs associated with the start-up of the new United Kingdom Home Oxygen Service contract and flat sales and higher costs in the U.S. Homecare business.
Chemicals segment sales of $493 million declined slightly over the prior year, principally due to lower volumes in Polyurethane Intermediates from customer shutdowns. However, Chemicals operating income of $50 million was up 18 percent over the prior year, driven by improved pricing to recover higher raw material, energy and natural gas costs.
Equipment segment revenues of $180 million rose substantially over the prior year. Higher air separation equipment sales in addition to LNG activity drove this increase. Operating income of $24 million was up significantly, driven by continued high LNG heat exchanger activity. The Equipment backlog at the end of the quarter was $596 million.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "We have seen strong volume growth in the first half of 2006 and are encouraged by the momentum we see in our businesses. With a great backlog of projects driving top-line growth, continued loading of our asset base, and improved productivity and aggressive cost management, we are well on our way to delivering our fourth consecutive year of double digit top-line growth while meeting our commitment to improve our return on capital."
Outlook
For the third quarter, the company expects earnings per share between $.88 and $.92. For the full year the company raised its earning guidance to a range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release regarding important risk factors.  Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors, including those specifically referenced as future events or outcomes that the company anticipates as well as, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services during that time; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; uninsured litigation judgments or settlements; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; charges related to currently undetermined portfolio management and cost reduction actions; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact, ability to complete and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures or unanticipated contract terminations; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; the recovery of insurance proceeds; the impact of new financial accounting standards; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.  The company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect any change in the company's assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R and began expensing the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior year results have not been restated.
Reconciliation
This press release contains non-GAAP measures, which adjust prior year results to include the pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options based on previous footnote disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. See the discussion under Share-Based Compensation in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the company's management uses internally to evaluate the company's baseline performance.

Chemicals Segment Portfolio Management
In March 2006, the company announced it is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses, restructuring its Polyurethane Intermediates business, sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, La., and invested in its Performance Materials business with the acquisition of specialty surfactants producer Tomah Products.

Air Products is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the company's ongoing portfolio management activities. The Amines business generated approximately $300 in revenues in 2005. Amines production facilities are located in Pace, Fla.; St. Gabriel, La.; and Camacari, Brazil. The consolidated Air Products Polymers joint venture with Wacker Chemie AG of Germany had approximately $550 in 2005 revenues with six manufacturing facilities including: South Brunswick, N.J.; Piedmont, S.C.; Calvert City, Ky.; Elkton, Md.; Ulsan, Korea; and Kln, Germany. Goldman Sachs is acting as the financial adviser to Air Products in connection with the potential sale of these businesses, which will be subject to Air Products' Board of Directors and regulatory approval. These businesses will be reported as discontinued operations if and when the Board of Directors, representing management with the requisite level of authority, commits to sell the businesses.
Exploring Sale of Amines and Polymers Business
Gain on Sale of a Chemical Facility
On 31 March 2006 as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the company sold its DNT production facility in Geismar, La., to BASF Corporation for $155.0. Expense was recognized for the write-off of the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and will continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas for BASF and other customers.
On 31 March 2006, the company acquired TomahProducts of Milton, Wis., in a cash transaction valued at $120.5. A preliminary purchase price allocation has been made and will be finalized when information needed to affirm underlying estimates is obtained. At 31 March 2006, goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $69.1 and identified intangibles amounted to $14.6. With sales of $73 in 2005, Tomah produces specialty surfactants and processing aids primarily for growth segments of the institutional and industrial cleaning, mining and oil field industries, among others. The Tomah acquisition reflects the company's strategy to expand its presence in profitable market segments where it can build on its surface science expertise.

The company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the company, the company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. In March 2006, the company publicly announced plans to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notified the supplier that it is highly unlikely that it will agree to further standstill agreements beyond May 2006, due to the company's reduced forecast for sulfuric acid requirements. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, it is management's judgment that the company will not be able to collect any amounts due.
Impairment of Loans Receivable
Share Repurchase Program
In March 2006, the Board of Directors of Air Products approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The company expects the share repurchase program to begin in the third quarter and to complete $500 of the program by 31 December 2006.
Purchase of Cryogenic Vessel Equipment
On 31 March 2006, the company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7 which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
Hurricanes
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005. During the three and six months ended 31 March 2006, the company collected insurance proceeds of $11 and $36 respectively, representing partial settlement with its insurers. Additional insurance recoveries for property damages and business interruption will be recognized as claims are settled. Other income for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006 included a net gain of $19.9 and $27.2, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of expenses for property damage. In addition, the company estimates the impact of business interruption at $(5.2) and $(32.7) for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006.
A table summarizing the impact of the Hurricanes is provided below:
Share-Based Compensation
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," and related interpretations and began expensing the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior to 1 October 2005, the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options, as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The estimated impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R in 2006 is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.13. The pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options in 2005 would have been a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $.13 for the year based on the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires a change in accounting for awards granted on or after 1 October 2005 to accelerate expense to the retirement eligible date for individuals who meet the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon their retirement. The impact of this change in 2006 for all share-based compensation programs is estimated to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.03, principally related to the stock option program, and is included in the total estimated impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R of $.13 for the year.
The company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in 2006 includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to 1 October 2005, and amortization related to new awards granted after 1 October 2005.
Because certain of the company's share-based compensation programs include a provision for a contingent cash settlement in the event of a change in control, the carrying amount of these awards based on a grant-date intrinsic value has been presented separately in the balance sheet outside of shareholders' equity. The company believes the likelihood of such an actual cash settlement is remote. Accordingly, the company has accounted for its stock options as equity instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No. 123R-4 issued by the FASB on 3 February 2006. Under the FSP, a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee's control does not trigger liability classification until it becomes probable that an event will occur.

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Access the Q3 earnings teleconference scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on July 26 by calling (913) 312-1300 and entering passcode 3768544, or listen on the Web at: www.airproducts.com/Invest/financialnews/EarningsReleases.htm.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 26, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $210 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.92 for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006. Net income increased 10 percent and diluted EPS was up 12 percent compared with the prior year.
Third quarter earnings comparisons are affected by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R and expensing of stock options as of October 1, 2005. On a comparable basis (including stock compensation expenses), net income increased 14 percent and diluted EPS increased 16 percent. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release. The following discussion of third quarter results is on a comparable basis.
Revenues of $2,320 million were up 12 percent and operating income of $298 million was up 18 percent over the prior year on strong Gases volumes and higher Equipment activity.
John P. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We produced record earnings and sales this quarter and continued to improve our return on capital. This performance was powered by strong volumes across our global energy and process industries (EPI), electronics, and merchant gas businesses, demonstrating the strength of our business and market positions to continue to deliver profitable growth and higher returns."
Strong volumes drove record Gases segment sales of $1,689 million up 14 percent and operating income of $241 million up 19 percent over the prior year. EPI reflected the positive impact of five new hydrogen plants which have come onstream in fiscal 2006. Electronics gases and specialty materials continued to grow, with solid demand from semiconductor and flat panel markets. The global merchant gas business also saw volume growth in all regions of the world with improved recovery of energy costs in North America.
Chemicals segment sales of $480 million were flat with the prior year, as better pricing offset weaker volumes. Chemicals operating income of $42 million was down 10 percent on lower volumes, principally due to two customer shutdowns in the company's polyurethane intermediates business over the past year.
Equipment segment revenues of $150 million rose 28 percent over the prior year and operating income of $26 million was up significantly, driven by high LNG heat exchanger and large air separation activity. The company's $623 million backlog remains strong, with one new LNG heat exchanger order signed in the quarter. Air Products also won a
 
new contract to supply two large air separation units for one of the world's largest gas-to-liquids (GTL) projects in Nigeria.
Looking forward, Mr. Jones said, "For the third consecutive year, we are on track to deliver double-digit sales growth, double-digit earnings growth, and improved return on capital. This performance is a real tribute to our employees who are transforming Air Products into a higher growth, less cyclical and higher return company."
Air Products raised its full-year EPS estimate to between $3.49 and $3.53 per share, an 18-20 percent improvement over the prior year. This guidance excludes any impact related to ongoing Chemicals portfolio and business simplification actions.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release regarding important risk factors. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors, including those specifically referenced as future events or outcomes that the company anticipates as well as, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services during that time; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; uninsured litigation judgments or settlements; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; charges related to currently undetermined portfolio management and cost reduction actions; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact, ability to complete and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures or unanticipated contract terminations; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; the recovery of insurance proceeds; the impact of new financial accounting standards; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized. The company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect any change in the company's assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.
Reconciliation:
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior year results have not been restated.
This press release contains non-GAAP measures, which adjust prior year results to include the pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options based on previous footnote disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. Stock options have been accounted for as equity instruments. See the discussion under Share-Based Payments in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial
 
information by providing measures which the company's management uses internally to evaluate the company's baseline performance.
Please review the attached financial tables:
 
 
 
 
1. CHEMICALS SEGMENT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
In March 2006, the company announced it is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses, restructuring its Polyurethane Intermediates business, sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, La., and invested in its Performance Materials business with the acquisition of specialty surfactants producer Tomah Products.
3
Exploring Sale of Amines and Polymers Business
Air Products is exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the company's ongoing portfolio management activities. The Amines business generated approximately $300 in revenues in 2005. Amines production facilities are located in Pace, Fla.; St. Gabriel, La.; and Camacari, Brazil. The consolidated Air Products Polymers joint venture with Wacker Chemie AG of Germany had approximately $550 in 2005 revenues with six manufacturing facilities including: South Brunswick, N.J.; Piedmont, S.C.; Calvert City, Ky.; Elkton, Md.; Ulsan, Korea; and Kln, Germany. Goldman Sachs is acting as the financial adviser to Air Products in connection with the potential sale of these businesses, which will be subject to Air Products' Board of Directors and regulatory approval. These businesses will be reported as discontinued operations if and when the Board of Directors commits to sell the businesses.
Gain on Sale of a Chemical Facility
On 31 March 2006 as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the company sold its DNT production facility in Geismar, La., to BASF Corporation for $155.0. Expense was recognized for the write-off of the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and will continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas for BASF and other customers.
Acquisition of Tomah
3
Products
On 31 March 2006, the company acquired TomahProducts of Milton, Wis., in a cash transaction valued at $120.5. A preliminary purchase price allocation was made in the second quarter. This allocation was revised in the third quarter based on a preliminary third-party appraisal and the allocation will be finalized in the fourth quarter. At 30 June 2006, goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $73.1 and identified intangibles amounted to $24.1. With sales of $73 in 2005, Tomah produces specialty surfactants and processing aids primarily for growth segments of the institutional and industrial cleaning, mining and oil field industries, among others. The Tomah acquisition reflects the company's strategy to expand its presence in profitable market segments where it can build on its surface science expertise.

Impairment of Loans Receivable
In the second quarter of 2006, the company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the company, the company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
 
2. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter and expects to complete $500 of the program by 31 December 2006. During the third quarter of 2006, the company purchased 3.2 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $206.9.
3. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7 which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
4. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
On 23 May 2006, the company entered into a five-year $1,200 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries. This agreement terminates and replaces the company's $700 revolving credit agreement dated 18 December 2003.
5. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Insurance recoveries for property damages and business interruption are recognized as claims are settled. Operating income for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006 included a net gain of $9.1 and $36.3, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of expenses for property damage. During the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006, the company collected insurance proceeds of $13.2 and $49.0, respectively. The company estimates the impact of business interruption at $(4.6) and $(37.3) for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006.
A table summarizing the impact of the Hurricanes is provided below:
 
6. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," and related interpretations and began expensing the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior to 1 October 2005, the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options, as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The estimated impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R in 2006 is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.13. The pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options in 2005 would have been a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $.13 for the year based on the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires a change in accounting for awards granted on or after 1 October 2005 to accelerate expense to the retirement eligible date for individuals who meet the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon their retirement. The impact of this change in 2006 for all share-based compensation programs is estimated to reduce diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $.03, principally related to the stock option program, and is included in the total estimated impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R of $.13 for the year.
The company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in 2006 includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to 1 October 2005, and amortization related to new awards granted after 1 October 2005.
Because certain of the company's share-based compensation programs included a provision for a contingent cash settlement in the event of a change in control, the carrying amount of these awards based on a grant-date intrinsic value is presented separately in the 30 September 2005 balance sheet outside of shareholders' equity. During the quarter ended 30 June 2006, the company undertook a process to amend its outstanding share-based compensation awards to remove the contingent cash settlement provision, resulting in no separate presentation outside of shareholders' equity as of 30 June 2006.

There are approximately 225 employees directly associated with this business and all will continue with Taminco.

News Release
7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (August 24, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today announced leadership and organization changes effective October 1, 2006 to reflect the company's strategy and focus on growth. John E. McGlade, currently group vice president, Chemicals, has been named president and chief operating officer by the Board of Directors.
John P.

He has recently led our restructuring efforts in the Chemicals Group. His broad relationships and understanding of our businesses, customers and partners around the world will enable him to play a key leadership role in the continuing evolution of Air Products into a higher return and growth-oriented company."

Exhibit 3
SECTION 1.  . (a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (hereinafter called the Corporation) for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business as may be properly brought before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors (hereinafter called the Board) shall each year fix, which date shall be within thirteen months subsequent to the last annual meeting of stockholders.
Annual Meetings
(b) To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given written notice thereof, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, not more than 120 days or less than 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days before or more than 60 calendar days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120 calendar day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90 calendar day prior to such annual meeting. Any such notice shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment, (ii) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal, a representation to that effect. No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (v) of the preceding sentence.
th
th
The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (hereinafter called the Exchange Act) and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting; provided, however, that if such stockholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.
SECTION 2.  . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the whole Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be designated in the notice thereof.
Special Meetings
SECTION 3.  . Each stockholder of record shall be given written notice of each meeting of stockholders, which notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice of any meeting may be given to a stockholder by a form of electronic transmission consented to by such stockholder.
Notice of Meetings
When a meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
SECTION 4.  . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation during normal business hours. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and be subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
List of Stockholders
SECTION 5.  . The holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business unless and except that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, unless a different period is prescribed by applicable law.
Quorum; Adjournment
SECTION 6.  . Such person as the Board may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the highest ranking officer of the Corporation who is present shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman appoints.
Organization
SECTION 7.  . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
SECTION 8.  . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a stockholder entitled to vote or the holder of a proxy of such person, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Voting and Proxies
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Inspectors of Election
SECTION 1.  . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
General Powers
SECTION 2.  . The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed from time to time by a vote of the majority of the whole Board. (The term "whole Board" as used in these Bylaws shall mean the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies or unfilled previously authorized directorships.)
Number
Nominations of persons for election as directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination provided for in this Section 2, who complies with the procedures for such nomination specified in this Section 2. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors may nominate a person or persons for election as directors only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination is given in accordance with the procedures for bringing business before the meeting set forth in Article I, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, not more than 120 days or less than 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the 120 day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or the 10 day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (d) all information that would be reasonably relevant to a determination by the Board as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder is "independent" within the meaning of all applicable securities law and stock exchange requirements; (e) all information that would be relevant to a determination by the Board (or any relevant committee) as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder meets any standards for Board membership set forth by the Board (or any committee thereof) in any publicly available documents; (f) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; (g) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director if so elected; and (h) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s), a representation to that effect. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders to elect directors and the Board may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s) without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (h) of the preceding sentence.

Subject to Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
SECTION 3. . Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
Section 4. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Indemnification by a Court
Section 5. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
Section 6. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
Advance Payment of Expenses
Section 7.
Procedure for Indemnification
(a) To obtain indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The right to indemnification as granted by Section 1, 2, or 6 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as applicable hereof, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Section 8. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
Insurance
Section 9. . For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:
Certain Definitions
(a) The term "action, suit or proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.

(d) The term "judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, all direct and indirect payments of any type or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, all penalties and amounts required to be forfeited or reimbursed to the Corporation), as well as any penalties or excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan).
(e) The term "Corporation" shall include, without limitation and in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers or agents, so that any person who is or was a director or officer or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(g) The term "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include, without limitation, any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries.

Limitation on Indemnification
(a) . To indemnify or advance expenses to an indemnitee with respect to an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, except with respect to an action, suit or proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification (which shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 7(b) and 10(b) of this Article V), unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Claims Initiated by an Indemnitee
(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or an accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by the indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
Section 11. . The Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify an indemnitee under this Article for amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the Corporation's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner that would impose any fine or other obligation on the indemnitee without the indemnitee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Certain Settlement Provisions
Section 12. . The provisions for indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which an indemnitee may have under any provision of law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in any court in which a proceeding is brought, the vote of the Corporation's stockholders or disinterested directors, agreements, or otherwise, and the indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the indemnitee has ceased acting as a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the indemnitee.
Nonexclusivity
SECTION 1. . The Board shall designate the officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation who shall have power to execute and deliver deeds, contracts, mortgages, bonds, debentures, checks, drafts, and other orders for the payment of money and other documents for and in the name of the Corporation and may authorize such officers, employees, and agents to delegate such power (including authority to redelegate) by written instrument to other officers, employees, or agents of the Corporation. Such designation may be by resolution or otherwise, and the authority granted may be general or confined to specific instances, all as the Board may determine.
Execution of Documents
SECTION 2. . The Board shall designate the officers of the Corporation who shall have authority to appoint from time to time an agent or agents of the Corporation to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Corporation the powers and rights which the Corporation may have as the holder of stock or other securities or interests in any other corporation or business entity and to vote or consent in respect of such stock securities or interests; such designated officers may instruct the person or persons so appointed as to the manner of exercising such powers and rights; and such designated officers may execute or cause to be executed in the name and on behalf of the Corporation and under its corporate seal, or otherwise, such written proxies, powers of attorney, or other instruments as they may deem necessary or proper in order that the Corporation may exercise such powers and rights.
Proxies in Respect of Stock or Other Securities of Other Corporations
SECTION 1. . Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman of the Board, President, or a Vice President and the Treasurer and/or Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation. Where a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case an officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate has been issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or whose facsimile signature has been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding share certificates, the Corporation may provide that, subject to the rights of stockholders under applicable law, some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock may be uncertificated shares.
Certificates of Stock
SECTION 2. . In the event of loss, theft, or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft, or destruction and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.
Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates
SECTION 3. . Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Except where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 2 of Article VI of these Bylaws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved shall be surrendered for cancellation before a new certificate is issued therefor.
Transfers of Stock
SECTION 4. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.
Record Date
SECTION 5. . The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 25, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $128 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57 for its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006. This includes $0.13 of discontinued operations related to the sale of the company's amines business and $0.21 for corporate reorganization and streamlining initiatives, as previously announced. Also included is a $0.03 per share charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for asset retirement obligations. On a continuing operations basis excluding the impact of these items, net income was $210 million and EPS was $0.94, up 19 and 22 percent, respectively, compared with prior year results.*
The discussion of fourth quarter and full year results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. It excludes the impacts of the above items and includes the proforma impact of stock option expensing on fiscal 2005 results. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,359 million were up 18 percent from the prior year on strong volume performance in the company's Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy segments. Record operating income of $305 million was up 25 percent versus prior year.
For fiscal 2006, sales of $8,850 million were up 14 percent and net income of $795 million was up 17 percent over the prior year due to higher volumes broadly across the Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy segments. Diluted EPS of $3.50 was up 19 percent.
John Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We had a strong fourth quarter, and closed out another excellent year in 2006. For the third consecutive year, we achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth and a meaningful improvement in return on capital, which this year was up 130 basis points. In addition to our solid operating performance, we overcame the challenges presented by last year's hurricanes, sold our amines business, reorganized for growth and improved returns, and completed the first $500 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program."
Individual Business Segment Performance
As announced on October 2, 2006, Air Products now manages its operations, assesses performance and reports results by six global business segments. For the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter:
 
Outlook
Looking forward, Jones said, "We enter fiscal 2007 well positioned to drive continued strong top-line and earnings growth and focused on achieving our 12.5 percent return on capital goal. We expect to see strong volume growth from the full-year impact of the new hydrogen plants we brought onstream in fiscal 2006, continued growth from new merchant and tonnage plants in Asia, and continuing strength in our Electronics and Performance Materials end markets. While we have challenges in Healthcare, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to meaningfully improve the business this year.
"Building off of the momentum we achieved in 2006, our people are generating real productivity across our businesses, using continuous improvement tools and SAP. All of the actions we are taking will make us a more focused, less cyclical, higher growth and higher return company."
The company currently anticipates fiscal year 2007 EPS in the range of $3.84 to $4.00 per share. On a continuing operations basis, this represents year-over-year earnings growth of 10 to 14 percent. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ending December 31, 2006, EPS is expected to be between $0.90 and $0.95.

1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 2006, the company announced it was exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the company's ongoing portfolio management activities. On 23 August 2006, the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Amines business to Taminco N.V. (Taminco). The sale closed on 29 September 2006. The sales price was $211.2 in cash, with certain liabilities assumed by the purchaser. The company recorded a loss of $40.0 ($23.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) in connection with the sale of the Amines business and the recording of certain environmental and contractual obligations that the company retained related to the Pace facility. The Amines business produced methylamines and higher amines products used globally in household, industrial and agricultural products. The sale of the Amines business included the employees and certain assets and liabilities of the production facilities located in Pace, Fla.; St. Gabriel, La.; and Camacari, Brazil. The Amines business is being accounted for as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. In addition, fourth quarter results also included a charge of $8.3 ($5.2 after tax or $.02 per share) for costs associated with a contract termination.
2. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
The results from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a charge of $72.1 ($46.8 after-tax, or $.21 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2006 Plan). This charge included $60.6 for severance and pension related costs for approximately 325 position eliminations and $11.5 for asset disposals and facility closures. Details of this charge are shown below.
Several cost reduction initiatives in Europe will result in the elimination of about two-thirds of the 325 positions at a cost of $37.6. The company will reorganize and streamline certain organizations/activities in Europe which will focus on improving effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, in anticipation of the sale of a small business a charge of $1.4 was recognized in the fourth quarter to write down the assets to net realizable value.
The company completed a strategy review of its Electronics business in 2006. The company has decided to rationalize some products and assets reflecting a simpler portfolio. A charge of $10.1 was recognized principally for an asset disposal and the write-down of certain investments/assets to net realizable value. Additionally, a charge of $3.8 was recognized for severance and pension related costs.
In addition to the Europe and Electronics initiatives, the company continues to implement cost reduction and productivity related efforts to simplify its management structure and business practices. A charge of $19.2 for severance and related pension costs was recognized for these efforts.
3. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The company adopted Financial Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (FIN No. 47) effective 30 September 2006 and recorded an after-tax charge of $6.2 as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. On 30 September 2006, the company recognized the transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation.
 
4. INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT
The company recorded a charge of $17.3 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to adjust its North American Healthcare inventories to actual based on physical inventory counts.
5. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006 as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the company sold its DNT production facility in Geismar, La., to BASF Corporation for $155.0. Expense was recognized for the write-off of the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and will continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas for BASF and other customers.
6. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the company, the company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
7. ACQUISITION OF TOMAH
PRODUCTS
3
On 31 March 2006, the company acquired TomahProducts of Milton, Wis., in a cash transaction valued at $120.5. A preliminary purchase price allocation was made in the second quarter. This allocation was revised in the third quarter based on a preliminary third-party appraisal and the allocation will be finalized in early fiscal 2007. As of 30 September 2006, goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $73.1 and identified intangibles amounted to $24.1. With sales of $73 in 2005, Tomah produces specialty surfactants and processing aids primarily for growth segments of the institutional and industrial cleaning, mining and oil field industries, among others. The Tomah acquisition reflects the company's strategy to expand its presence in profitable market segments where it can build on its surface science expertise.

8. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter and as of 30 September 2006 had purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1. The company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program by 30 September 2007.
9. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7 which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
10. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
On 23 May 2006, the company entered into a five-year $1,200 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries. This agreement terminates and replaces the company's $700 revolving credit agreement dated 18 December 2003.
 
11. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Insurance recoveries for property damages and business interruption are recognized as claims are settled. Operating income for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a net gain of $15.4 and $51.7, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006, the company collected insurance proceeds of $18.0 and $67.0, respectively. The company estimates the impact of business interruption at $(.9) and $(36.7) for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006.
A table summarizing the impact of the Hurricanes is provided below:
12. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," and related interpretations and began expensing the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior to 1 October 2005, the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options, as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R in 2006 reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by $.13. This excludes the acceleration of expense for share-based compensation awards included in the global cost reduction plan charge. The pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options in 2005 would have been a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $.13 for the year based on the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires a change in accounting for awards granted on or after 1 October 2005 to accelerate expense to the retirement eligible date for individuals who meet the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon their retirement. The impact of this change in 2006 for all share-based compensation programs reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by $.03, principally related to the stock option program, and is included in the total impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R of $.13 for the year.
The company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in 2006 includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to 1 October 2005, and amortization related to new awards granted on or after 1 October 2005.
Because certain of the company's share-based compensation programs included a provision for a contingent cash settlement in the event of a change in control, the carrying amount of these awards based on a grant-date intrinsic value is presented separately in the 30 September 2005 balance sheet outside of shareholders' equity. During the quarter ended 30 June 2006, the company undertook a process to amend its outstanding share-based compensation awards to remove the contingent cash settlement provision, resulting in no separate presentation outside of shareholders' equity as of 30 June 2006.
 
13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In September 2006, the company completed a business reorganization that aligns its organization structure to its strategic direction. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006, the company will report financial information based on six business segments. The company manages its operations, assesses performance, and reports results by these segments, which are organized based on differences in product and/or type of customer. The company's six business segments consist of Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, Equipment and Energy, Healthcare, and Chemicals.

7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
A teleconference will be held today at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time. See details below.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 8, 2007)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today announced it has reached definitive agreement with The Linde Group to acquire the industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o. for 370 million euros ($481 million). The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. For regulatory purposes, BOC Gazy was required to be sold by Linde as a result of its purchase of The BOC Group plc in September 2006.
The BOC Gazy business had fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately 126 million euros ($164 million) and earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately 38 million euros ($50 million). The business has approximately 750 employees, five major industrial gas plants and six cylinder transfills serving customers across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, steel and base metals, among others.
"We're taking advantage of a unique opportunity to become the number one industrial gas supplier in Central Europe's fastest growing economy," said Air Products Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Jones. "With manufacturing moving eastward in Europe and investment increasingly flowing in that direction, we intend to capitalize on the substantial growth potential in these markets. The business we are acquiring is very attractive and fits our strategy to become a higher growth and higher return company. It allows us to build critical mass and a low cost position in the region and be a bridge to serving a broad range of customers across Central and Eastern Europe."
Air Products operates in 15 countries throughout Europe, including the central and eastern European countries of the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland. Total European sales in Air Products' 2006 fiscal year were approximately $2.6 billion. Within Poland, Air Products has been a supplier of industrial gases since the early 1990s and has annual sales of about 11 million euros ($15 million).
Air Products plans to finance the transaction through euro debt.

The Company sold its Amines business to Taminco N.V. on 29 September 2006. Accordingly, the Amines business is being accounted for as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.
3. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006, as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the Company sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, to BASF Corporation for $155.0. The Company wrote off the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas to customers.
4. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the Company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the Company, the Company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the Company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the Company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the Company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the Company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
5. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The Company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7, which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the Company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
 
6. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The Company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 and purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1 during 2006. The Company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program during fiscal year 2007 and during the six months ended 31 March 2007 purchased 3.5 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $247.4.
7. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Operating income for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006 included a net gain of $19.9 and $27.2, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and six months ended 31 March 2006, the Company collected insurance proceeds of $10.8 and $35.8, respectively. The Company estimated the impact of business interruption at $(5.2) and $(31.2) for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006, respectively.
A table summarizing the estimated impact of the Hurricanes for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006 is provided below:

No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (v) of the preceding sentence.

SECTION 2.  . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the whole Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be designated in the notice thereof.
Special Meetings
SECTION 3.  . Each stockholder of record shall be given written notice of each meeting of stockholders, which notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice of any meeting may be given to a stockholder by a form of electronic transmission consented to by such stockholder.
Notice of Meetings
When a meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation during normal business hours. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and be subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
List of Stockholders
SECTION 5.  . The holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business unless and except that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, unless a different period is prescribed by applicable law.

Organization
SECTION 7.  . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
SECTION 8.  . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or the holder of a proxy of such person, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Voting and Proxies
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Inspectors of Election
SECTION 1.  . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

Treasurer
SECTION 1. . Subject to Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article V shall be a contract right.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
SECTION 2. . Subject to Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
SECTION 3. . Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
Section 4. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Indemnification by a Court
Section 5. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
Section 6. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
Advance Payment of Expenses
Section 7.
Procedure for Indemnification
(a) To obtain indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The right to indemnification as granted by Section 1, 2, or 6 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as applicable hereof, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Section 8. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
Insurance
Section 9. . For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:
Certain Definitions
(a) The term "action, suit or proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.

(d) The term "judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, all direct and indirect payments of any type or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, all penalties and amounts required to be forfeited or reimbursed to the Corporation), as well as any penalties or excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan).
(e) The term "Corporation" shall include, without limitation and in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers or agents, so that any person who is or was a director or officer or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(g) The term "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include, without limitation, any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries.

Limitation on Indemnification
(a) . To indemnify or advance expenses to an indemnitee with respect to an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, except with respect to an action, suit or proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification (which shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 7(b) and 10(b) of this Article V), unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Claims Initiated by an Indemnitee
(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or an accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by the indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
Section 11. . The Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify an indemnitee under this Article for amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the Corporation's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner that would impose any fine or other obligation on the indemnitee without the indemnitee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Certain Settlement Provisions
Section 12. . The provisions for indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which an indemnitee may have under any provision of law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in any court in which a proceeding is brought, the vote of the Corporation's stockholders or disinterested directors, agreements, or otherwise, and the indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the indemnitee has ceased acting as a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the indemnitee.
Nonexclusivity
SECTION 1. . The Board shall designate the officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation who shall have power to execute and deliver deeds, contracts, mortgages, bonds, debentures, checks, drafts, and other orders for the payment of money and other documents for and in the name of the Corporation and may authorize such officers, employees, and agents to delegate such power (including authority to redelegate) by written instrument to other officers, employees, or agents of the Corporation. Such designation may be by resolution or otherwise, and the authority granted may be general or confined to specific instances, all as the Board may determine.

Proxies in Respect of Stock or Other Securities of Other Corporations
SECTION 1. . Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, or a Vice President and the Treasurer and/or Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation. Where a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case an officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate has been issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or whose facsimile signature has been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding share certificates, the Corporation may provide that, subject to the rights of stockholders under applicable law, some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock may be uncertificated shares.
Certificates of Stock
SECTION 2. . In the event of loss, theft, or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft, or destruction and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.
Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates
SECTION 3. . Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Except where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 2 of Article VI of these Bylaws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved shall be surrendered for cancellation before a new certificate is issued therefore.
Transfers of Stock
SECTION 4. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.
Record Date
SECTION 5. . The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Registered Stockholders
SECTION 1. . Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions, if any, of the Certificate of Incorporation, may be declared by the Board at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
Dividends
SECTION 2. . Each director, each member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors, and each officer of the Corporation shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account or other records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports, or statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors so designated, or by any other person as to matters which such director or committee member reasonably believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 25, 2007)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported record net income of $285 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.28, for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007. Included in these results was a favorable tax adjustment of $27 million, or $.12 per share. On a continuing operations basis, net income increased $78 million, or 38 percent, and diluted EPS was up $.38, or 42 percent, compared with the prior year.
Record third quarter revenue of $2,595 million was up 16 percent from the prior year on higher volumes and pricing in the Merchant segment and strong volumes in the Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Operating income of $365 million was up 25 percent versus the prior year.
John Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We again exceeded expectations with record performance this quarter. Sales were at their highest ever, as demand for our gases and materials across core manufacturing, energy and electronics markets remained strong. We also saw continued benefit from the strategic investments we've made in growth businesses and regions, including closing on our acquisition in Poland. Most importantly, our people's focus on growth and productivity again delivered outstanding improvement in our drive to increase return on capital."

1. CUSTOMER CONTRACT TERMINATION
By agreement dated 1 June 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. Selected amendments to the agreements were subject to the approval of the customer's Board of Directors, which approval was obtained on 12 July 2007. As a result, the Company will recognize a before-tax gain in the range of $30 to $37 in the fourth quarter.
2. PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENT LOSS
A number of senior managers and others have retired or announced their intention to retire in fiscal year 2007. A settlement loss will be recognized at the time of the cash payment of the liability. The total settlement loss anticipated for these 2007 retirements is expected to be approximately $30-$35. The company will recognize about $10 of this charge in the fourth quarter of 2007 with the remaining balance recognized in fiscal year 2008. The actual amount of the settlement loss will be based upon current pension assumptions (e.g. discount rate) at the time of the cash payments of the liabilities.
3. INCOME TAXES
In June 2007, the Company settled tax audits through fiscal year 2004 with the Internal Revenue Service. The audit settlement resulted in a tax benefit of $27.5 ($.12 per share).
4. ACQUISITION
On 30 April 2007, the Company acquired 98.1% of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o from The Linde Group for 370 million Euros or $506.8. The results of operations for BOC Gazy were included in the Company's consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. A preliminary purchase price allocation has been made and will be finalized when information needed to affirm underlying estimates is obtained. The preliminary estimated values as of the acquisition date for plant and equipment amounted to $193.2, identified intangibles amounted to $158.8, and goodwill amounted to $140.7. With this acquisition, the Company has obtained a significant market position in Central Europe's industrial gases market. The BOC Gazy business had fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately 126 million Euros. The business has approximately 750 employees, five major industrial gas plants, and six cylinder transfills serving customers across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, steel and base metals, among others.
5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 2006, the Company announced it was exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the Company's ongoing portfolio management activities. The Company sold its Amines business to Taminco N.V. on 29 September 2006. Accordingly, the Amines business has been accounted for as discontinued operations.
6. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The Company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 and purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1 during 2006. The Company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program during fiscal year 2007 and during the nine months ended 30 June 2007 purchased 5.1 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $373.1.
7. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006, as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the Company sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, to BASF Corporation for $155.0. The Company wrote off the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Company's industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas to customers.
 
8. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the Company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the Company, the Company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the Company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the Company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the Company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the Company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
9. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The Company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7, which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the Company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
10. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Operating income for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006 included a net gain of $9.1 and $36.3, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006, the Company collected insurance proceeds of $13.2 and $49.0, respectively. The Company estimated the impact of business interruption at $(4.6) and $(35.8) for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006, respectively.
A table summarizing the estimated impact of the Hurricanes for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006 is provided below:
The Company closed-out its insurance claim related to the Hurricanes by the end of fiscal 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company collected $19.1 of insurance proceeds. Operating income for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2007 was not impacted except for higher depreciation expense of $1.4 and $4.2, respectively.

We are positioned in the right markets and geographies to deliver above-average growth into the future.
Outlook
"We are also maintaining our commitment to improve returns.

2. CUSTOMER CONTRACT SETTLEMENT
By agreement dated 1 June 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. Selected amendments to the agreements were subject to the approval of the customer's Board of Directors, which approval was obtained on 12 July 2007. As a result, the Company recognized a before-tax gain of $36.8 ($23.6 after-tax, or $.11 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007.
3. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
The results from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2007 included a charge of $13.7 ($8.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. Approximately one-half of the position eliminations relate to the continuation of European initiatives to streamline certain activities. The remaining position eliminations relate to the continued cost reduction and productivity efforts of the Company. This year's charge included $6.5 for severance and pension related costs for the elimination of approximately 125 positions and $7.2 for the write-down of certain investments.
The results from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a charge of $72.1 ($46.8 after-tax, or $.21 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. This charge included $60.6 for severance and pension related costs for approximately 325 position eliminations and $11.5 for asset disposals and facility closures. As of 30 September 2007, the majority of the planned actions associated with the 2006 charge were completed with the exception of a small number of position eliminations and/or associated benefit payments. These actions are expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Details of the charge taken in 2006 are provided below.
Several cost reduction initiatives in Europe resulted in the elimination of about two-thirds of the 325 positions at a cost of $37.6. The Company reorganized and streamlined certain organizations/activities in Europe to focus on improving effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, in anticipation of the sale of a small business, which occurred in the first quarter of 2007, a charge of $1.4 was recognized to write down the assets to net realizable value.
The Company completed a strategy review of its Electronics business in 2006 and decided to rationalize some products and assets reflecting a simpler portfolio. A charge of $10.1 was recognized principally for an asset disposal and the write-down of certain investments/assets. Additionally, a charge of $3.8 was recognized for severance and pension related costs.
In addition to the Europe and Electronics initiatives, the Company implemented cost reduction and productivity related efforts to simplify its management structure and business practices. A charge of $19.2 for severance and related pension costs was recognized for these efforts.
 
4. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of senior managers and others have retired in fiscal year 2007. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement or six months after the participant's retirement date. If payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year a settlement loss is triggered under pension accounting rules. However, a settlement loss may not be recognized until the time the pension benefit obligation is settled. The total settlement loss anticipated for these 2007 retirements is expected to be approximately $30 to $35. The Company recognized $10.3 of this charge in the fourth quarter of 2007 based on cash payments made, with the remaining balance to be recognized in fiscal year 2008. The actual amount of the settlement loss will be based upon current pension assumptions (e.g. discount rate) at the time of the cash payments of the liabilities.
5. DONATION/SALE OF COST INVESTMENT
The Company has a cost-basis investment in a publicly traded foreign company which has been classified as an available-for-sale investment, with holding gains and losses recorded to other comprehensive income, net of income tax. On 19 September 2007, the Company donated 65% of its investment to a tax-exempt charitable organization and sold 15% of its investment for cash. The Company will deduct the fair value of the donation in its fiscal 2007 income tax returns. As a result of the donation, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $18.3 in the fourth quarter of 2007 and a pre-tax expense of $4.7 for the carrying value of the investment. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $9.7. In combination, the donation and sale had a favorable net impact of $5.0 on operating income, $19.8 on net income, and $.09 on earnings per share.
6. INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS & ADJUSTMENTS
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $11.3 ($.05 per share) primarily from tax audit settlements and adjustments and related interest income. In June 2007, the Company settled tax audits through fiscal year 2004 with the Internal Revenue Service. This audit settlement resulted in a tax benefit of $27.5 ($.12 per share) in the third quarter of 2007. For the twelve months ended 30 September 2007, tax audit settlements and adjustments and related interest income totaled $38.8 ($.17 per share).
7. ACQUISITION
On 30 April 2007, the Company acquired 98.1% of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o from The Linde Group. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company increased its ownership percentage to 99.9%. The total acquisition cost, less cash acquired, was 380 million Euros or $518.4. The results of operations for BOC Gazy were included in the Company's consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation, including the recognition of deferred taxes, is substantially complete with assigned values for plant and equipment equal to $180.6, identified intangibles of $167.2, and goodwill of $186.4.
With this acquisition, the Company has obtained a significant market position in Central Europe's industrial gases market. The BOC Gazy business had fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately 126 million Euros. The business has approximately 750 employees, five major industrial gas plants, and six cylinder transfills serving customers across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, steel and base metals, among others.
8. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business and the Amines business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
 
HPPC Business
In September 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of its HPPC business which had been reported as part of the Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. The Company's HPPC product line consists of the development, manufacture and supply of high purity process chemicals used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States and Europe. In October 2007, the Company executed an agreement of sale with a buyer. The sale is scheduled to close on 31 December 2007 and will include manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, this business generated sales of $20.9 and income, net of tax, of $.4. For the twelve months ended 30 September 2007, this business generated sales of $87.2 and income, net of tax, of $2.2. In addition, the Company wrote-down the assets of the HPPC business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax, or $.04 per share).
Amines Business
On 29 September 2006, the Company sold its Amines business to Taminco N.V. The sales price was $211.2 in cash, with certain liabilities assumed by the purchaser. The Company recorded a loss of $40.0 ($23.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) in connection with the sale of the Amines business and the recording of certain environmental and contractual obligations that the Company retained. In addition, 2006 fourth quarter results also included a charge of $8.3 ($5.2 after-tax, or $.02 per share) for costs associated with a contract termination. The Amines business produced methylamines and higher amines products used globally in household, industrial, and agricultural products. The sale of the Amines business included the employees and certain assets and liabilities of the production facilities located in Pace, Florida; St. Gabriel, Louisiana; and Camacari, Brazil.
9. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. This action was in addition to an existing $1,500 share repurchase program which was announced in March 2006. During 2006, the Company purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1. During 2007, the Company purchased an additional 7.3 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $567.3. The Company expects to complete the remaining $436.6 of the original $1,500 program in fiscal year 2008. The recently announced program for an additional $1,000 will be completed at the Company's discretion while maintaining sufficient funds for investing in its businesses and growth opportunities.
10. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (FIN No. 47) effective 30 September 2006 and recorded an after-tax charge of $6.2 as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. On 30 September 2006, the Company recognized the transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation.
11. INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT
The Company recorded a charge of $17.3 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to adjust its North American Healthcare inventories to actual based on physical inventory counts.
12. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006, as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the Company sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, to BASF Corporation for $155.0. The Company wrote off the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Company's industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas to customers.
 
13. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the Company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the Company, the Company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the Company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the Company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the Company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the Company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
14. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The Company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7, which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the Company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
15. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005. Operating income for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a net gain of $15.4 and $51.7, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006, the Company collected insurance proceeds of $18.0 and $67.0, respectively. The Company estimated the impact of business interruption at $(.9) and $(36.7) for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006, respectively.
A table summarizing the estimated impact of the Hurricanes for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 is provided below:
The Company closed-out its insurance claim related to the Hurricanes by the end of fiscal 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company collected $19.1 of insurance proceeds. Operating income for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2007 was not impacted except for higher depreciation expense of $1.4 and $5.7, respectively.

"Good Reason" includes a material adverse change in the Covered Executives position or responsibilities; a reduction in compensation or benefits other than a reduction generally applicable to the Company's highly compensated employees; a relocation more than 50 mi les from the Covered Executives current place of employment; or a material breach of the Companys obligations to the Covered Executive under the agreement or any other agreement or any benefit plan, program, or arrangement. "Change in Control" is defined as the acquisition by a person or persons acting in concert of Company securities representing 30% or more of the voting power of the Company, a turnover of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in a two-year period without the approval of each new directors nomination or election by two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the two-year period, or any other event or series of events which the Board determines constitutes a change in control. Benefits provided under the agreements include the following:  A pro-rata target annual incentive award for the year of termination;  A payment equal to two times (three times in the case of Mr. McGlade, Mr. Huck, and Ms. Minella; hereafter, the "Grandfathered Executives") the sum of the Covered Executives current annual base salary, and target annual incentive award for the Companys current fiscal year;  A cash payment equal to two times (three in the case of the Grandfathered Executives) the value of the matching contributions and credits made by the Company during the last full fiscal year to the Companys qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans, respectively, on behalf of the Covered Executive;  For those Covered Executives whose primary retirement benefit is provided under the Companys defined benefit retirement plans (excludes Mr. Jones and Mr. Marsland), a cash payment equal to the actuarial present value of the additional pension benefits the Covered Executive would have been entitled to receive under the Companys qualified and nonqualified pension plans had the Covered Executive accumulated an additional two years (three years in the case of the Grandfathered Executives) of credited service under the plans; and, if the officer is not eligible for early retirement under the pension plans at the time of termination, the actuarial present value of the early retirement subsidy on the Covered Executives accumulated pension benefit including the additional service;  For those Covered Executives whose primary retirement benefit is provided under the Company's qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans (Mr. Jones and Mr. Marsland), a cash payment equal to the Company's nonmatching contributions and credits that would have been made to the plans by the Company on behalf of the Covered Executive had he or she remained employed an additional two years (three years in the case of Grandfathered Executives), assuming no adverse change in the Covered Executive's cash compensation;  Continuation of medical, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits for a period of two years (three years in the case of the Grandfathered Executives);  Outplacement benefits and legal fees associated with the termination of employment and enforcement of the agreement;  A tax gross-up payment for excise taxes incurred by a Covered Executive on payments under the agreement or otherwise considered to be excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, but only if the benefits the Covered Executive will receive under the agreement are more than 110% of the payment the Covered Executive could receive without triggering an excise tax. The benefits provided to a Covered Executive under the agreement will be reduced to the extent the cash benefits described above and any other payments to a Covered Executive which are considered "excess parachute payments" under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code are less than 110% of the amount of the payments the Covered Executive could receive without incurring an excise tax liability. The c hange in control severance agreements also provide for modification of a Covered Executives outstanding equity awards under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan upon a Change in Control as follows:  Stock options and stock appreciation rights outstanding for at least six months become immediately exercisable and may, at the discretion of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the "Committee"), be exchanged for a cash payment of the value based on the "Change in Control Price";  Restrictions on restricted stock lapse and such stock may, at the discretion of the Committee, be exchanged for a cash payment of its value based on the "Change in Control Price";  Deferred stock units not subject to performance conditions vest, and are distributed in shares or may be paid out in cash based on the "Change in Control Price" in the discretion of the Committee;  A pro-rata portion of d eferred stock units subject to performance conditions vest at the target level and will be distributed in shares or may be paid out in cash based on the "Change in Control Price" in the discretion of the Committee. The "Change in Control Price" is the highest tender or exchange offer price paid or to be paid for the Companys common stock pursuant to an offer associated with the Change in Control, or the price paid or to be paid for common stock under an agreement associated with the Change in Control. The foregoing description of the change in control severance agreements is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements, a form of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1.

In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company and to assure your continued dedication and the availability of your advice and counsel during the possibility and pendency of, and following, a change in the control of Air Products, Air Products agrees that it will provide you, or cause you to be provided the severance benefits set forth in this change in control agreement ("the Agreement") in the event your employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a Change in Control under the circumstances described herein.

COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
A.  If during the Contract Period the Company terminates your employment for Cause, or your employment terminates due to death, Disability or Retirement, the Company shall pay to you as soon as practicable but no later than 30 days after the Termination Date (i) your Base Salary to the extent earned but unpaid as of the Termination Date and vacation pay accrued through the Termination Date, plus (ii) any benefits or awards which have been earned by you or become payable to you under any policy or employee compensation or benefit plan of the Company. The benefits payable to you due to your death, Disability, Retirement or other Termination of Employment under all Benefit Plans, Bonus Plans and Incentive Plans in which you are participating before such Termination of Employment, will be paid as provided under such plans and the Company will have no further obligation.
Termination for Cause, Death, Disability, or Retirement.
B.  If during the Contract Period the Company terminates your employment other than for death, Retirement, Disability or Cause (it being understood that a purported termination for Disability or Cause which is disputed and finally determined not to have been proper or which is not effected in accordance with the procedures required in Section 3 will be a Termination other than for Cause or Disability), or you terminate your employment for Good Reason, then Air Products will provide you or cause you to be provided the payments and benefits described below in this Subsection 4B.
Termination other than for Cause, Death, Retirement or Disability or for Good Reason.
(i) . The Company will pay to you on or before the fifth day following your Termination Date, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of the following amounts:
Cash Payment
(a) Your earned but unpaid Base Salary through your Termination Date at the higher of the rate in effect on the Termination Date or the rate in effect immediately before any purported reduction in your Base Salary constituting Good Reason and the vacation pay that you accrued through the Termination Date.
(b) The product of (I) the amount of the Target Annual Bonus for which you would have been eligible if you had been employed by the Company on the last day of the Fiscal Year (or other bonus performance cycle that includes your Termination Date), multiplied by (II) a fraction of which the numerator is the number of days which have elapsed through the Termination Date in such Fiscal Year (or, if applicable, such other bonus performance cycle that includes your Termination Date) and the denominator is 365 (or, if applicable, the number of days in such other performance cycle that includes your Termination Date).
(c) Two [three for Grandfathered Executives] times the sum of (I) your Base Salary at the rate required by subparagraph (i)(a) above and (II) the Company matching contributions made and/or accrued in respect of your contributions to or deferrals under the Savings Plans during and/or for the last full Fiscal Year of the Company preceding your Termination Date.
(d) Two [three for Grandfathered Executives] times the Target Annual Bonus for the Fiscal Year or other bonus performance cycle in which your Termination Date occurs.
(e) (I)  If you are a participant in the Pension Plans and are not a Core Contribution Participant under the Retirement Savings Plan, a pension payment equal to the sum of (I) the difference between the actuarial present values as of the Termination Date of your accrued vested pension benefits under the Pension Plans and those pension benefits calculated by adding two [three for Grandfathered Executives] years of service to the actual service credited under such plans for benefit accrual and vesting purposes, and (II) the actuarial present value as of the Termination Date of any early retirement subsidy available under the Pension Plans (as in effect immediately prior to the beginning of the Contract Period), for which you are not eligible due to termination before satisfying age and service requirements for such subsidy, the value of such subsidy to be calculated on your benefit with the two [three for Grandfathered Executives] additional years of
credited service described in (I). For purposes of determining present values in calculating the pension payment, it shall be assumed that your benefit will commence in the form of a straight life annuity on the later of the Termination Date or the date on which you could retire and commence a benefit under the Pension Plans without reduction for commencement before the normal retirement date under such Pension Plans were you employed by the Company on such date. The interest rate used for such purposes shall be the average of the average monthly yields for municipal bonds published monthly by Moodys Investors' Service Inc. for the three months immediately preceding your Termination Date. For purposes of determining actuarial present values in calculating the pension payment, life expectancy assumptions most frequently used by the Pension Plans' actuaries for other purposes shall be used. The calculation of the pension payment described in this subparagraph shall be made by a nationally recognized firm of enrolled actuaries acceptable to you and the Company. The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such actuarial firm. The calculation made by such actuarial firm shall be binding on you and the Company;
or
(II)  If you are a Core Contribution Participant in the Retirement Savings Plan, a payment (in lieu of the payment described in clause (I) above) equal to the Company Core Contributions and Core Credits (as defined in the Savings Plans) that you would have received under the Savings Plans during the two-year period following the Termination Date assuming that (i) you remained actively employed by the Company during such two-year period, (ii) your Base Salary continued at the higher of the rate in effect on the Termination Date or the rate in effect immediately prior to any purported reduction in your Base Salary constituting Good Reason and (iii) your Annual Incentive Plan awards were equal in amount to the higher of the most recent award received prior to the Termination Date and the average of the awards available to you under the Annual Incentive Plan during and/or for each of the three full Fiscal Years immediately preceding the beginning of the Contract Period.
(f) For purposes of subparagraphs (i)(c), (i)(d) and (i)(e) of this Subsection 4B, in the event you have attained age 63 on or [62 for Grandfathered Executives] before your Termination Date, the amounts payable shall be reduced to an amount which bears the same proportion to the unreduced amount as the number of months preceding your sixty-fifth birthday bears to twenty four [thirty six for Grandfathered Executives].
(g) The amount of the payment described in (a)-(f) shall be reduced to the extent of any severance or redundancy benefit or payment sponsored by the Company and/or provided or required by applicable law or regulation, which is received by you on account of your Termination of Employment.
(h) If the amount of the payment described in (a)  (g) above cannot be finally determined on or before the fifth day following the Termination Date, the Company will pay to you on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of such payment and will pay the remainder of such payment as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth day after your Termination Date.
(ii) . The Company will provide for you and your dependents for two [three for Grandfathered Executives] years following your Termination Date, benefits equivalent to those provided by the Company under all life insurance, medical, dental, health and accident, long term disability, long term care plans or programs in which you were participating on your Termination Date or, in the event of a reduction in such benefits constituting Good Reason, equivalent to those provided immediately before such reduction; provided that, such benefits will not be provided beyond the period of time during which they would have been provided to you under such plans or programs, as in effect on your Termination Date or immediately before a reduction constituting Good Reason, had you not been Terminated other than for death, Retirement, Disability or Cause or Terminated for Good Reason, and such benefits will be provided for at least the period during which they would have been provided to you were this Agreement not in effect. In the event of your death during such two [three for Grandfathered Executives] year period, benefits in respect of you or to your beneficiaries will be provided in accordance with the terms of such plans or programs as if you were actively employed by the Company on the date of your death. Any continuation of benefits pursuant to this subparagraph shall not run concurrent with any continuation rights provided pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), and for purposes of applying COBRA with respect to your coverage under any group health plan, the end of coverage under this subparagraph shall be deemed to be the date of a qualifying event resulting from the termination of a covered employee. Except as specifically permitted by Section 409A, the coverage provided to you during any calendar year will not (A) affect the coverage to be provided to you in any other calendar year and (B) be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cost of continued benefits provided pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be shared by you and the Company in the same proportion and on the same terms as such costs were shared by you and the Company prior to your Termination Date or the proportion and terms in effect immediately prior to any purported change constituting Good Reason.

Any payment to you by the Company under this clause (iii) shall be limited to expenses incurred by you prior to the tenth anniversary of the expiration of this Agreement. All reimbursable expenses shall be reimbursed to you as promptly as practicable and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the expenses are incurred.

The Company shall, within 30 days of the Termination Date, make available to you at the Company's expense, outplacement counseling at times and locations that are convenient to you, with a nationally recognized outplacement counseling firm.

If the aggregate amount of Payments that you receive under this Agreement is less than 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount your Payments under the Agreement will be reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount; provided that the Payments to be reduced will be determined by you. The amount of the Excise Tax liability (including whether any such tax is properly applied), the Gross-Up Payment and the Safe Harbor Amount shall be determined by a nationally recognized public accounting firm acceptable to you and the Company, which firm shall provide you with a written opinion of the amount of the excise tax liability, if any. The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such accounting firm. The determination of the firm shall be binding on you and the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment paid to you under this clause (v) shall be paid as soon as practicable and before the underlying taxes are due and payable.

D.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 23, 2008)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $264 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.19, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2007. Net income increased 15 percent, and diluted EPS increased 16 percent compared with the prior year.
These results include $0.03 of discontinued operations related to a previously announced definitive agreement to divest Air Products' interest in its polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG and the completed sale of the company's High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business to KMG Chemicals during the quarter. On a continuing operations basis, net income increased 16 percent, and diluted EPS increased 17 percent.
First quarter revenues of $2,474 million were up nine percent from the prior year on higher volumes, improved pricing across most segments, and a weaker dollar. Operating income of $372 million was up 17 percent versus the prior year.
John McGlade, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our fiscal year is off to a great start, thanks to the dedication and commitment of our 22,000 employees worldwide. We delivered double-digit earnings growth and significant margin improvement during the quarter. This strong performance reflects the continued emphasis we have placed on delivering profitable growth through our global focus and relentless drive for productivity."
First Quarter Segment Performance
 
Outlook
McGlade said, "Economic activity through the first quarter of this year is tracking in line with our expectations. Looking forward, we expect high bidding activity and solid demand from our customers, who rely on our products and services to improve energy efficiency, plant productivity, product quality and environmental performance.
"We believe the actions we have taken over the past few years have transformed us into a high performing company that is positioned to produce strong results in a slowing economic environment. Our focus on growth markets and geographies, productivity and streamlined operations, combined with a robust backlog of projects, should allow us to consistently deliver higher growth and higher returns in both the short and long-term.
"We are now expecting 15 to 19 percent* year-on-year earnings growth and therefore, are raising our guidance."
The EPS guidance provided at the end of fiscal 2007 was $4.80 to $5.00, which included $0.17 of income for polymers for the full year and a $0.07 charge for pension settlements. Excluding these items, the underlying guidance was $4.70 to $4.90. On the same basis, the company is now forecasting a range of $4.85 to $5.00 for the year and $1.17 to $1.21 for the fiscal second quarter.

*The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate the Company's baseline performance. Presented below is a reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars)
1. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," (FIN No. 48) on 1 October 2007. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a $25.5 increase to its liability for uncertain tax positions. This increase was recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for $13.7, and goodwill for $11.8.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business and the Polymer Emulsions business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The balance sheet items of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
HPPC Business
In September 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of its HPPC business, which had previously been reported as part of the Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. The Company's HPPC business consisted of the development, manufacture, and supply of high-purity process chemicals used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States and Europe. The Company wrote down the assets of the HPPC business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax, or $.04 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the Company executed an agreement of sale with KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007 for cash proceeds of $69.3 and included manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe. Certain receivables and inventories will be sold to KMG Chemicals, Inc. subsequent to 31 December 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $22.9 and income, net of tax, of $.2. Also, the Company recorded an additional loss of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) on the sale of the business.
Polymer Emulsions Business
The Company announced it was exploring the sale of its Polymer Emulsions business in 2006 as part of the Company's ongoing portfolio management activities. In November 2007, the Company's Board of Directors granted the Company the authority to sell this business to its partner based on achieving certain contractual terms and conditions. On 11 December 2007, the Company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of the agreement, the Company will receive Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C., production facilities and their related businesses plus cash considerations of $265. The sale, which is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company anticipates a gain on the sale of the Polymer Emulsions business in the range of $65 to $85 ($42 to $55 after-tax).
In the first quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $151.2 and income, net of tax, of $6.8.
The sale consists of the global VAE polymers operations including production facilities located in Calvert City, Ky.; South Brunswick, N.J.; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea; and commercial and research capabilities in Allentown, Pa., and Burghausen, Germany. The business produces VAE for use in adhesives, paints and coatings, paper and carpet applications.
Upon completion of the sale, the Company will assume full ownership of the Elkton and Piedmont plants and related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives business. The Company intends to sell these businesses.
 
3. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of senior managers and others who were eligible for supplemental pension plan benefits retired in fiscal year 2007. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. If payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year, settlement accounting is triggered under pension accounting rules. However, a settlement loss may not be recognized until the time the pension obligation is settled. The Company recognized $10.3 for settlement losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 and an additional $1.4 in the first quarter of 2008, based on cash payments made. The Company expects to recognize an additional $25 to $30 for settlement losses in 2008, primarily in the second quarter. The actual amount of the settlement loss will be based upon current pension assumptions (e.g. discount rate) at the time cash payments are made to settle the obligations.
4. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. This action was in addition to an existing $1,500 share repurchase authorization which was announced in March 2006. As of 30 September 2007, the Company had purchased 15.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $1,063.4 under these two authorizations. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company purchased 2.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $189.8. The Company will continue to purchase shares under these authorizations at its discretion while maintaining sufficient funds for investing in its businesses and growth opportunities.
5. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Previously, the Company reported results for the Chemicals segment, which consisted of the Polymer Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business. Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business has been accounted for as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 2. Also beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the PUI business is reported as part of the Tonnage Gases segment and prior period information has been restated to reflect this business reorganization.

www.airproducts.com/Invest/financialnews/EarningsReleases.htm
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 23, 2008)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $314 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.43, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2008. Net income increased 38 percent, and diluted EPS increased 40 percent compared with the prior year.
These results include income from discontinued operations of $0.28 per share and a pension settlement charge of $0.08 per share. Excluding these items, net income of $270 million increased 24 percent, and diluted EPS of $1.23 increased 27 percent.
Second quarter revenues of $2,605 million were up 13 percent from the prior year on higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, higher pricing in Merchant Gases, and favorable currency. Excluding the pension settlement charge, operating income of $365 million increased 18 percent versus the prior year.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We had another strong quarter of double-digit sales and earnings growth. We made good progress on a number of our fiscal 2008 targets, including improving our operating margin and increasing our quarterly dividend by 16 percent. Finally, we completed the sale of our Polymer Emulsions business and announced our first sale of gas orders in the Middle East."
Second Quarter Segment Performance
 
Performance Materials volume gains were driven by strong demand in Europe and the Middle East and new product growth in emerging markets.
Outlook
McGlade said, "Despite slowing economic growth, we are positioned to continue double-digit earnings and sales growth while delivering on our commitment to improved margins and returns. This consistent performance is a result of the actions we have taken to shift our business portfolio to higher growth, less cyclical and higher return businesses. We see great opportunities ahead to expand our leading positions in the markets we serve around the world. We will continue to capitalize on our strong business and financial positions to serve our customers, drive for lower costs and productivity, and deliver superior financial results to our investors."
"With our strong first-half performance, growing backlog of new investments and improving margins driven by our productivity efforts, we are raising our guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share, representing 18-20 percent year-on-year earnings growth."
The company currently anticipates fiscal third quarter EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 per share, or 12 to 16 percent year-on-year earnings growth.

(Millions of dollars)
1. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," (FIN No. 48) on 1 October 2007. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a $25.5 increase to its liability for uncertain tax positions. This increase was recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for $13.7 and goodwill for $11.8.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business and the Polymer Emulsions business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The balance sheet items of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
HPPC Business
In September 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of its HPPC business, which had previously been reported as part of the Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. The Company's HPPC business consisted of the development, manufacture, and supply of high-purity process chemicals used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States and Europe. The Company wrote down the assets of the HPPC business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax, or $.04 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In October 2007, the Company executed an agreement of sale with KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007 for cash proceeds of $69.3 and included manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe. Subsequent to the sale, certain receivables and inventories are being sold to KMG Chemicals, Inc. In the first quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $22.9 and income, net of tax, of $.2. Also, the Company recorded an additional loss of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) on the sale of the business.
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 11 December 2007, the Company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. The sale closed on 31 January 2008. As part of the agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C., production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of the Polymer Emulsions business of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax).
In the second quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $78.8 and income, net of tax, of $3.3. For the six months ended 31 March 2008, sales were $230.0 and income, net of tax, was $10.1.
The sale consisted of the global VAE polymers operations including production facilities located in Calvert City, Ky.; South Brunswick, N.J.; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea; and commercial and research capabilities in Allentown, Pa., and Burghausen, Germany. The business produces VAE for use in adhesives, paints and coatings, paper and carpet applications.
Upon completion of the sale, the Company assumed full ownership of the Elkton and Piedmont plants and related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives business. The Company is currently actively marketing these businesses.
 
3. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of corporate officers and others who were eligible for supplemental pension plan benefits retired in fiscal year 2007. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. However, a settlement loss may not be recognized until the time the pension obligation is settled. Based on cash payments made, the Company recognized $10.3 for settlement losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 and an additional $1.4 and $26.3 in the first and second quarter of 2008, respectively. The Company expects to recognize an additional $1 to $2 for settlement losses in the remainder of 2008.
4. U.S. HEALTHCARE
The U.S. Healthcare business has operated below plan through the first six months of this fiscal year. While the Company continues to execute its plan to increase volume in key product lines such as respiratory therapy, the Company is evaluating its strategic alternatives. The Company expects to complete this process during the third quarter of this fiscal year. The Company continues to monitor the recoverability of goodwill of this reporting unit within the Healthcare segment. The asset value of the U.S. Healthcare business at 31 March 2008 was $456.1, of which $294.3 was goodwill.
5. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. This action was in addition to an existing $1,500 share repurchase authorization which was announced in March 2006. As of 30 September 2007, the Company had purchased 15.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $1,063.4. During the first six months of fiscal year 2008, the Company purchased 6.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $554.3. The Company has completed the 2006 authorization and will continue to purchase shares under the 2007 authorization at its discretion while maintaining sufficient funds for investing in its businesses and growth opportunities.
6. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Previously, the Company reported results for the Chemicals segment, which consisted of the Polymer Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business. Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business has been accounted for as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 2. Also beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the PUI business is reported as part of the Tonnage Gases segment and prior period information has been restated to reflect this business reorganization.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 22, 2008)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) announced today that it is planning to sell its U.S. Healthcare business and will record an impairment charge of approximately $315 million ($237 million after-tax) in its fiscal 2008 third quarter results, ended June 30. The company plans to report the U.S. Healthcare business as a discontinued operation beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter and will continue to operate and serve patients until the business is transitioned to a new owner.
In 2007, the company implemented a number of significant actions to improve the performance of its U.S. Healthcare business, including changes in management, a product and service offering simplification program, and other measures to drive earnings growth and improve profitability. During 2008, the business continued to underperform. As a result, in April 2008, Air Products disclosed that it was evaluating its strategic options for the business. Based on a review of the market and competitive conditions, the company determined that the U.S. Healthcare business no longer fit its business portfolio. At its July meeting, the company's Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the business, and the company is in discussions with potential buyers.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer John E. McGlade, said, "Our U.S. Healthcare employees have worked very hard to execute our plan to increase volumes and reduce costs. Unfortunately, despite progress in a number of areas, the U.S. business is still not meeting expectations. At this time, we believe the decision to sell this business is in the best interest of our shareholders. This in no way affects our healthcare operations outside of the U.S, which continue to perform well and remain a core component of our strategy moving forward."
Air Products is also announcing that it has reached preliminary agreement to sell its U.S. Healthcare businesses in the metropolitan New York area and in New Jersey, including its A&J Care locations in Glendale and Peekskill, New York and its COPD Services locations in Runnemede, Cape May Courthouse and Cedar Grove, New Jersey.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 23, 2008)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $70 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.32, for its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2008. These results include an impairment charge for its U.S. Healthcare business of $237 million after-tax, or $1.09 per share, and income from discontinued operations of $19 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share, principally from the company's sale of its remaining polymer emulsions assets. Excluding these items, income from continuing operations of $288 million increased 16 percent and diluted EPS of $1.32 increased 18 percent over the prior year.
Third quarter revenues of $2,808 million were up 16 percent from the prior year on higher volumes in the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, higher pricing in Merchant Gases, favorable currency, and higher natural gas cost pass through. Excluding the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge, operating income of $382 million increased nine percent versus the prior year. In addition, higher equity affiliate income contributed to the quarter's results, with continued growth and operating performance in a number of countries.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our businesses again delivered strong growth in a challenging economic environment. Our consistent operating performance reflects the actions we have taken to transform Air Products into a higher growth and less cyclical company under any economic scenario. We also announced two major orders in Tonnage Gases, completed the sale of our remaining Polymer Emulsions assets, and as we announced yesterday, are moving forward with the decision to sell our U.S. Healthcare business."
Third Quarter Segment Performance
 
Outlook
McGlade said, "We expect to continue to benefit from our very strong new business signings and the geographic diversity of our markets and portfolio of businesses. We are not, however, relying on growth and pricing alone. We will continue to focus relentlessly on driving productivity and reducing costs."
The company currently anticipates fiscal fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.37 to $1.42 per share, or 19 to 23 percent year-on-year earnings growth.

1. U.S. HEALTHCARE IMPAIRMENT
For the third quarter 2008, the Company performed an impairment analysis and recorded a charge of $314.8 ($237.0 after-tax, or $1.09 per share) related to its U.S. Healthcare business. The charge relates to the impairment of goodwill for $294.3, intangible assets for $11.7, plant and equipment for $7.8, and other assets for $1.0. The impairment reduces the carrying amount of the U.S. Healthcare reporting unit goodwill and intangible assets to zero. The impairment charge will not result in cash disbursement.
In 2007, the Company implemented several changes to improve performance, including management changes, product and service offering simplification, and other measures. However, market and competitive conditions have been more challenging than anticipated and financial results have not met expectations. In response to the disappointing financial results, during the third quarter management conducted an evaluation of the strategic alternatives for the business.
In accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142), and FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144), the Company determined an interim test for impairment was required for its U.S. Healthcare reporting unit during the third quarter of 2008, based on the combination of events described above. The Company reforecast its cashflows and utilized the expected present value of the future cash flows to calculate fair value of the U.S. Healthcare reporting unit in completing its SFAS No. 142 and 144 impairment tests.
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business, which will be reported as a discontinued operation beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additional charges may be recorded in future periods dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition.
Below are the consolidated results of the Company as if the U.S. Healthcare business was reported as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of 2008.
 
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Polymer Emulsions business and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The balance sheet items of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland Inc. for $92.0. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The expense to record the environmental obligation was $24.0 ($14.5 after-tax). The Piedmont site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner. Before the sale, which triggered expense recognition, remediation costs had been capitalized since they improved the property as compared to its condition when originally acquired. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company's Polymer Emulsions business.
On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C., production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax) in the second quarter of 2008 for this sale which consisted of the global VAE polymers operations including production facilities located in Calvert City, Ky.; South Brunswick, N.J.; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea; and commercial and research capabilities in Allentown, Pa., and Burghausen, Germany. The business produces VAE for use in adhesives, paints and coatings, paper, and carpet applications.
 
The operating results of the Polymer Emulsions business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
HPPC Business
In September 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of its HPPC business, which had previously been reported as part of the Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. The Company's HPPC business consisted of the development, manufacture, and supply of high-purity process chemicals used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States and Europe. The Company wrote down the assets of the HPPC business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In October 2007, the Company executed an agreement of sale with KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007 for cash proceeds of $69.3 and included manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe. Subsequent to the sale, certain receivables and inventories are being sold to KMG Chemicals, Inc. In the first quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $22.9 and income, net of tax, of $.2. Also, the Company recorded an additional loss of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) on the sale of the business. In 2007, the HPPC business generated sales of $21.2 and $66.2 and income, net of tax, of $.4 and $1.8 in the three and nine months ended 30 June 2007, respectively.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," (FIN No. 48) on 1 October 2007. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a $25.1 increase to its liability for uncertain tax positions. This increase was recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for $13.3 and goodwill for $11.8.
4. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of corporate officers and others who were eligible for supplemental pension plan benefits retired in fiscal year 2007. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. However, a settlement loss may not be recognized until the time the pension obligation is settled. Based on cash payments made, the Company recognized $10.3 for settlement losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 and an additional $1.0 and $28.7 in the three and nine months ended 30 June 2008, respectively. The Company expects to recognize an additional $1 for settlement losses in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
5. INCOME TAXES
In June 2007, the Company settled tax audits through fiscal year 2004 with the Internal Revenue Service. The audit settlement resulted in a tax benefit of $27.5 ($.12 per share).
6. BOC GAZY ACQUISITION
On 30 April 2007, the Company acquired 98.1% of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z.o.o. (BOC Gazy) from The Linde Group for 370 million Euros or $506.8. The results of operations for BOC Gazy were included in the Company's consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company increased its ownership percentage to 99.9%. The total acquisition cost, less cash acquired, was 380 million Euros or $518.4.
7. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. This action was in addition to an existing $1,500 share repurchase authorization which was announced in March 2006. As of 30 September 2007, the Company had purchased 15.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $1,063.4. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, the Company purchased 6.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $554.3. The Company has completed the 2006 authorization and will continue to purchase shares under the 2007 authorization at its discretion while maintaining sufficient funds for investing in its businesses and growth opportunities.
8. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Previously, the Company reported results for the Chemicals segment, which consisted of the Polymer Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business. Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business has been accounted for as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 2. Also beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the PUI business is reported as part of the Tonnage Gases segment and prior period information has been restated to reflect this business reorganization.

Highlights:
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 22, 2008)  Air Products today reported net income of $262 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21, for its fiscal 2008 fourth quarter versus $293 million and $1.31, respectively, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fiscal 2007 fourth quarter results included a gain on a polyurethane intermediates contract settlement of $.11 per share, a tax benefit on the charitable donation and gain on sale of an investment of $.09 per share, a charge for a supplemental pension plan of $.03 per share, a charge for a global cost reduction plan of $.04 per share, and a tax benefit from audit settlements and adjustments of $.05 per share. With these items excluded, income and EPS from continuing operations were $256 million and $1.15, respectively.
Excluding these five items from income from continuing operations in 2007, 2008 fiscal fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $273 million increased seven percent and diluted EPS of $1.26 increased 10 percent.
The following discussion of fourth quarter and full year results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,715 million were up 14 percent from the prior year on higher volumes and better pricing in Merchant Gases and Performance Materials, favorable currency, and higher natural gas and raw material cost pass-through. Operating income of $373 million was up three percent. Included in operating income was a $.05
 
per share loss related to a fire at the company's nitrogen trifluoride (NF) facility in Korea, and a $.05 per share unfavorable impact from the recent Gulf Coast hurricanes.

For fiscal 2008, sales of $10,415 million were up 14 percent and income from continuing operations of $1,107 million was up 16 percent over the prior year. Operating income of $1,522 was up 12 percent, and diluted EPS of $5.05 was up 18 percent over the prior year.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, 2008 represented another year of strong performance for the company, with 14 percent sales growth, 18 percent EPS growth and a 50 basis point improvement in ROCE to 13 percent, while continuing to drive improvements in our portfolio. However, weaker demand in Electronics and softer-than-expected volumes in Europe impacted our fourth quarter results."
Fourth Quarter Segment Performance
Outlook
Looking forward, McGlade said, "Despite the unprecedented volatility in the global economy, we remain committed to our long-term goals to improve our margins and returns, and capture the substantial growth opportunities that exist in our markets. We currently project our capital spending to be $1.6 to $1.8 billion in 2009, up from $1.4 billion in 2008. Our project backlog is at an all-time high, and we announced this week two new agreements to supply hydrogen to ExxonMobil at their Baton Rouge and Baytown refineries. Our strong, predictable cash flow, coupled with our solid, well-
 
managed balance sheet, allows us to finance the growth next year and continue to grow our capital spending in the future."
McGlade went on to say, "In the short term, we are very focused on controlling costs and are taking many actions to minimize discretionary spending. We also are pursuing cost reductions by capitalizing on our SAP investment to continue driving down SG&A and transaction costs. We are increasing the energy efficiency at our plants, lowering maintenance costs, and reducing distribution expense per unit of product delivered. Although we are likely to see a much weaker global economy in 2009, we remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle."
The company today announced initial guidance for fiscal year 2009 EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.35 per share, representing year-over-year earnings growth on a continuing operations basis of one to six percent. For the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ending December 31, 2008, EPS is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.21 per share.

The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate the Company's baseline performance. Presented below are reconciliations of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is calculated as earnings after tax divided by five-quarter average total capital. Earnings after tax is defined as operating income and equity affiliates' income, after tax at the Company's effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and taxes have been adjusted for the disclosed items detailed in the consolidated results table above. Total capital consists of total debt, shareholders' equity, and minority interest.
Capital Expenditures
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures when adjusting for spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities which are built to service a specific customer are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with EITF No. 01-08, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease," and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities.
Billions of Dollars
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars)
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike reduced short-term demand from U.S. Gulf Coast customers and drove temporary increases in operational costs. The estimated impact on fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $.05.
1. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2008, a fire at the Company's Ulsan, Korea nitrogen trifluoride (NF) production facility required the plant to be shut down. The Company has been able to continue supplying NF to its customers. The Company anticipates bringing the Ulsan plant back online beginning in January 2009.
2. LOSS FROM PROPERTY DAMAGE
3
3
Other income (expense) for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2008 included a net loss of $14.7 ($10.7 after-tax, or $.05 per share) related to property damage. The net book value of the damaged property was written off and a receivable was recorded for expected property damage insurance recoveries.
The U. S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The balance sheet items of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. Accordingly, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. Healthcare business is accounted for as discontinued operations.
U.S. Healthcare
For the fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business.
In 2007, the Company implemented several changes to improve performance, including management changes, product and service offering simplification, and other measures. However, market and competitive conditions were more challenging than anticipated and financial results did not meet expectations. In response to the disappointing financial results, during the third quarter 2008 management conducted an evaluation of the strategic alternatives for the business.
In accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142), and FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144), the Company determined an interim test for impairment was required for its U.S. Healthcare reporting unit during the third quarter of 2008, based on the combination of events described above. The Company reforecast its cash flows and utilized the expected present value of the future cash
 
flows to calculate fair value of the U.S. Healthcare reporting unit in completing its SFAS No. 142 and 144 impairment tests.
The operating results of the U.S. Healthcare business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland Inc. for $92.0. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The expense to record the environmental obligation was $24.0 ($14.5 after-tax). The Piedmont site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner. Before the sale, which triggered expense recognition, remediation costs had been capitalized since they improved the property as compared to its condition when originally acquired. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company's Polymer Emulsions business.
On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md., and Piedmont, S.C., production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax) in the second quarter of 2008 for this sale which consisted of the global VAE polymers operations including production facilities located in Calvert City, Ky.; South Brunswick, N.J.; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea; and commercial and research capabilities in Allentown, Pa., and Burghausen, Germany. The business produces VAE for use in adhesives, paints and coatings, paper, and carpet applications.
 
The operating results of the Polymer Emulsions business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
HPPC Business
In September 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of its HPPC business, which had previously been reported as part of the Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. The Company's HPPC business consisted of the development, manufacture, and supply of high-purity process chemicals used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States and Europe. The Company wrote down the assets of the HPPC business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In October 2007, the Company executed an agreement of sale with KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007 for cash proceeds of $69.3 and included manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe. Subsequent to the sale, certain receivables and inventories were sold to KMG Chemicals, Inc. In the first quarter of 2008, this business generated sales of $22.9 and income, net of tax, of $.2. Also, the Company recorded an additional loss of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) on the sale of the business. In 2007, the HPPC business generated sales of $20.9 and $87.2 and income, net of tax, of $.4 and $2.2 in the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2007, respectively.
4. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of corporate officers and others who were eligible for supplemental pension plan benefits retired in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. However, a settlement loss may not be recognized until the time the pension obligation is settled. Based on cash payments made, the Company recognized $10.3 for settlement losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 and an additional $1.6 and $30.3 in the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2008, respectively.
5. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. This action was in addition to an existing $1,500 share repurchase authorization which was announced in March 2006. As of 30 September 2007, the Company had purchased 15.0 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $1,063.4. During fiscal year 2008, the Company purchased 8.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $787.4. The Company has completed the 2006 authorization and will continue to purchase shares under the 2007 authorization at its discretion while maintaining sufficient funds for investing in its businesses and growth opportunities.
6. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," (FIN No. 48) on 1 October 2007. Upon adoption, the Company
 
recognized a $25.1 increase to its liability for uncertain tax positions. This increase was recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for $13.3 and goodwill for $11.8.
7. CUSTOMER CONTRACT SETTLEMENT
By agreement dated 1 June 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated, and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. Selected amendments to the agreements were subject to the approval of the customer's Board of Directors, which approval was obtained on 12 July 2007. As a result, the Company recognized a before-tax gain of $36.8 ($23.6 after-tax, or $.11 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2007.
8. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
The results from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2007 included a charge of $13.7 ($8.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. The charge included $6.5 for severance and pension-related costs for the elimination of approximately 125 positions and $7.2 for the write-down of certain investments. Approximately one-half of the position eliminations related to the continuation of European initiatives to streamline certain activities. The remaining position eliminations related to the continued cost reduction and productivity efforts of the Company. As of 30 September 2008, the actions associated with the 2007 charge were complete.
9. DONATION/SALE OF COST INVESTMENT
The Company has a cost-basis investment in a publicly traded foreign company which has been classified as an available-for-sale investment, with holding gains and losses recorded to other comprehensive income, net of income tax. On 19 September 2007, the Company donated 65% of its investment to a tax-exempt charitable organization and sold 15% of its investment for cash. The Company deducted the fair value of the donation in its fiscal 2007 income tax returns. As a result of the donation, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $18.3 in the fourth quarter of 2007 and a pre-tax expense of $4.7 for the carrying value of the investment. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $9.7. In combination, the donation and sale had a favorable net impact of $5.0 on operating income, $19.8 on net income, and $.09 on earnings per share.
10. INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS & ADJUSTMENTS
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $11.3 ($.05 per share) primarily from tax audit settlements and adjustments and related interest income. In June 2007, the Company settled tax audits through fiscal year 2004 with the Internal Revenue Service. This audit settlement resulted in a tax benefit of $27.5 ($.12 per share) in the third quarter of 2007. For the twelve months ended 30 September 2007, tax audit settlements and adjustments and related interest income totaled $38.8 ($.17 per share).
11. BOC GAZY ACQUISITION
On 30 April 2007, the Company acquired 98.1% of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z.o.o. (BOC Gazy) from The Linde Group for 370 million Euros or $506.8. The results of operations for BOC Gazy were included in the Company's consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company increased its ownership percentage to 99.9%. The total acquisition cost, less cash acquired, was 380 million Euros or $518.4.
12. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Previously, the Company reported results for a Healthcare segment and a Chemicals segment (which consisted of the Polymer Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business). Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. Healthcare business was accounted for as discontinued operations and the European Healthcare business was reported as part of the Merchant Gases segment. Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business was accounted for as discontinued operations and the PUI business was reported as part of the Tonnage Gases segment. Prior period information has been restated. Refer to Note 3 for information on discontinued operations.
 
 
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures when adjusting for spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities which are built to service a specific customer are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with EITF No. 01-08, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease," and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's capital expenditures.
Presented below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a Non-GAAP measure.

No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (10) of the second preceding sentence.

The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present.

SECTION 1. .

Interpretation, Amendment, and Survival of this Article
SECTION 2. . Subject to Section 4 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
SECTION 3. . Subject to Section 4 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity, and only to the extent of such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
SECTION 4. . Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or Section 3 of this Article V, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
SECTION 5. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 2 and 3 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because such indemnitee has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the indemnitee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Indemnification by a Court
SECTION 6. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article V to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
SECTION 7. Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such actions, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) the statement or statements described in Section 8 (a) from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be made without regard to whether a determination that indemnification is proper has been made in accordance with Section 4. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
SECTION 8.
Procedure
(a) To obtain an advance or final indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's advance or final indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for advancement pursuant to Section 7 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The rights to indemnification and advancement as granted by Section 2, 3, or 7 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 7 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as applicable hereof, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's rights to indemnification and advancement, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
Insurance
SECTION 10. . For purposes of this Article V, the following definitions shall apply:
Certain Definitions

(d) The term "judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, all direct and indirect payments of any type or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, all penalties and amounts required to be forfeited or reimbursed to the Corporation), as well as any penalties or excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan).
(e) The term "Corporation" shall include, without limitation and in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers or agents, so that any person who is or was a director or officer or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

Limitation on Indemnification
(a) To indemnify or advance expenses to an indemnitee with respect to an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, except with respect to an action, suit or proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification (which shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 8(b) and 11(b) of this Article V), unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or an accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by the indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.

SECTION 12. . The Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify an indemnitee under this Article for amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the Corporation's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner that would impose any fine or other obligation on the indemnitee without the indemnitee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Certain Settlement Provisions
SECTION 13. . The provisions for indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which an indemnitee may have under any provision of law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in any court in which a proceeding is brought, the vote of the Corporation's stockholders or disinterested directors, agreements, or otherwise, and the indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the indemnitee has ceased acting as a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the indemnitee.
Nonexclusivity
SECTION 1. . The Board shall designate the officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation who shall have power to execute and deliver deeds, contracts, mortgages, bonds, debentures, checks, drafts, and other orders for the payment of money and other documents for and in the name of the Corporation and may authorize such officers, employees, and agents to delegate such power (including authority to redelegate) by written instrument to other officers, employees, or agents of the Corporation. Such designation may be by resolution or otherwise, and the authority granted may be general or confined to specific instances, all as the Board may determine.
Execution of Documents
SECTION 2. . The Board shall designate the officers of the Corporation who shall have authority to appoint from time to time an agent or agents of the Corporation to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Corporation the powers and rights which the Corporation may have as the holder of stock or other securities or interests in any other corporation or business entity and to vote or consent in respect of such stock securities or interests; such designated officers may instruct the person or persons so appointed as to the manner of exercising such powers and rights; and such designated officers may execute or cause to be executed in the name and on behalf of the Corporation and under its corporate seal, or otherwise, such written proxies, powers of attorney, or other instruments as they may deem necessary or proper in order that the Corporation may exercise such powers and rights.

Where a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case an officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate has been issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or whose facsimile signature has been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding share certificates, the Corporation may provide that, subject to the rights of stockholders under applicable law, some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock may be uncertificated shares.
Certificates of Stock
SECTION 2. . In the event of loss, theft, or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft, or destruction and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.

SECTION 4. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.

News Release
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
The company will host a teleconference on this announcement at 9:00 a.m. EST today.
Access it by dialing 416-642-5212 and entering passcode 5689240 or listen on the Web:

. A replay will be available beginning at 12:00 p.m. EST on December 16 through midnight December 23, 2008.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (December 16, 2008)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today announced that it will take a restructuring charge to earnings in its fiscal 2009 first quarter to move to a lower cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The company also announced that it is revising its earnings outlook for its fiscal 2009 first quarter.
The pre-tax charge to earnings in the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $140 to $160 million, or approximately $0.43 to $0.50 per share. About three-quarters of this restructuring charge is for severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 1,300 positions, or about seven percent of Air Products' global workforce. The reductions are targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the company's technology and business development spending, and lowering its plant operating costs. The remainder of the restructuring charge is for business exits and asset management actions.
The restructuring charge is expected to reduce fixed costs by approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009, with savings expected to exceed $110 million in fiscal 2010 and beyond.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said, "These cost-reduction actions are necessary to reach our margin improvement goals. They are also in response to declining business conditions around the world. This is clearly one of the weakest business environments we have seen across our end-markets. However, our financial position remains strong, and with a significant portion of our business under medium- and long-term supply contracts, we expect to continue generating strong cash flow."
The company also posted its quarter-to-date sales through November on its website at . Sales were down six percent, principally due to a falloff in consumer demand for semiconductors and liquid crystal displays impacting demand in Air Products' Electronics business, and a negative currency impact, as the dollar has strengthened.
www.airproducts.com/Invest/financialnews/current.htm
Based on current financial data, fiscal 2009 first quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations is now expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.00, excluding the restructuring charge.
Air Products plans to provide full fiscal 2009 first quarter financial results on Wednesday, January 21, 2009 and will issue a press release later this month with the teleconference details.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 21, 2009)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $69 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.32 for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2008. This includes a $0.55 per share charge for the previously announced global cost reduction plan and a $0.10 per share loss from discontinued operations.
Excluding the impact of these items, income was $206 million and diluted EPS was $0.97, down 21 and 18 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. The discussion of first quarter results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. It excludes the impacts of the above items. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
First quarter revenues of $2,195 million declined nine percent and operating income of $288 million was down 24 percent from the prior year on weaker volumes, primarily in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments, and unfavorable currency.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Over the quarter, we saw further deterioration in business conditions, resulting in one of the weakest economic environments we've ever seen. It was evident that the shocks to the global economy have shattered consumer confidence, which has significantly impacted customers' operating rates across most of our end markets. In response, we continue to take aggressive actions to reduce our costs and drive to a lower cost structure."

demand. Performance Materials volumes dropped on lower demand from coatings, autos, housing and other end markets.
Outlook
McGlade said, "While the global economic environment is poor, we continue to build and maintain our strong positions, taking the necessary near-term actions to deliver improvement and growth in the future. We have a good backlog of projects and opportunities in front of us. Our solid balance sheet and access to capital will enable us to take advantage of these opportunities."
The company expects second quarter EPS from continuing operations to be between $0.80 and $0.90 per share and full year EPS from continuing operations to be between $4.00 and $4.30 per share.

(Millions of dollars)
 
(Millions of dollars)

(Millions of dollars)
1. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective 1 October 2008, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a method for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 157-2 delayed the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities until 1 October 2009 for the Company. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not impact the Company's financial statements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company adopted the early measurement date change of SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," for its U.K. and Belgium pension plans as of 1 October 2008. SFAS No. 158 required the Company to change the measurement date for these plans from 30 June to 30 September (end of fiscal year). As a result of this change, pension expense and actuarial gains/losses for the three-month period ended 30 September 2008 were recognized as adjustments to retained earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), respectively. The after-tax charge to retained earnings was $8.1. AOCI was credited $35.8 for net actuarial gains on an after-tax basis. These adjustments only affected the balance sheet.
2. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
During the first quarter ended 31 December 2008, the Company announced a global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The results from continuing operations included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share) for this plan. This charge included $120.0 for severance and pension costs. The Company will eliminate approximately 1,400 positions, or about seven percent of the Company's global workforce. The reductions are targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the Company's technology and business development spending, and lowering its plant operating costs. The remainder of the charge, $54.2, is for business exits and asset management actions. Assets held for sale were written down to net realizable value and an environmental liability of $16.0 was recognized. The planned actions are expected to be substantially completed within the next twelve months.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The balance sheet items of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
For additional historical information on these discontinued operations, refer to the Company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K.
U.S. Healthcare
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. During fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business. The Company anticipates selling this business in fiscal 2009 and is in active discussions with potential buyers.
 
In December 2008, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share) reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Also, a tax benefit of $8.8, or $.04 per share, was recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit related to the impairment charges.
Additional charges may be recorded in future periods dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition.
The operating results of the U.S. Healthcare business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
Polymer Emulsions Business
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business generated sales of $151.2 and income, net of tax, of $6.8. The Company completed the sale of its Polymer Emulsions business in fiscal year 2008.
HPPC Business
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and income, net of tax, of $.2. The Company closed on the sale of its HPPC business on 31 December 2007.
4. CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY
On 6 January 2009, a major customer of the Company began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This customer receives product principally from the Tonnage Gases segment. At 31 December 2008, the Company had outstanding net trade receivables with the customer of $35.7. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate its exposure related to this customer, if any. As such, the Company did not recognize any charges associated with this bankruptcy as of 31 December 2008.
 
(Millions of dollars)
(Millions of dollars)
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to service a specific customer are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with EITF No. 01-08, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease," and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's capital expenditures.
Presented below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 22, 2009)  Air Products (NYSE: APD) today reported income from continuing operations of $189 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2009. Income from continuing operations decreased 31 percent and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 29 percent from the prior year. Prior year results included a pension settlement charge of $0.08 per share, which is excluded from prior year comparisons.
Second quarter revenues of $1,955 million declined 23 percent on weaker volumes, unfavorable currency, and lower natural gas and raw material cost pass-through. Operating income of $260 million was down 31 percent from the prior year on weaker volumes and unfavorable currency.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The unprecedented deterioration in global manufacturing continued into our second quarter, as producers extended their holiday shutdowns. As expected, we saw weaker volumes, contributing to what we said would be our low point for our fiscal year. However, we were able to partially offset these declines with benefits from our cost and productivity actions."
Second Quarter Segment Performance
 
Outlook
McGlade said, "In this economic environment, visibility is limited, and the business climate remains weak. We expect to see some seasonal volume pick up in Merchant Gases and Performance Materials, and a modest improvement in Electronics in the second half of our fiscal year. Our continued discipline and cost reduction actions will also further benefit earnings. Despite the challenging environment, we continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities serving energy, environmental and emerging markets."
Air Products now expects third quarter EPS from continuing operations to be between $0.93 and $1.02 per share and full-year EPS from continuing operations to be between $3.85 and $4.05 per share. Given the lack of economic momentum, the company continues to look at additional cost actions that could result in a charge in its fiscal third quarter. This guidance excludes the impact of these potential cost reduction charges.

Presented below are reconciliations of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars)
1. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective 1 January 2009, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and how they affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement only requires additional disclosure and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The disclosures will be included in the Company's Form 10-Q filing.
The Company adopted the measurement date change of SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," for its U.K. and Belgium pension plans as of 1 October 2008. SFAS No. 158 required the Company to change the measurement date for these plans from 30 June to 30 September (end of fiscal year). As a result of this change, pension expense and actuarial gains/losses for the three-month period ended 30 September 2008 were recognized as adjustments to retained earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), respectively. The after-tax charge to retained earnings was $8.1. AOCI was credited $35.8 for net actuarial gains on an after-tax basis. These adjustments only affected the balance sheet.
Effective 1 October 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a method for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. 157-2 delayed the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities until 1 October 2009 for the Company. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not impact the Company's financial statements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
2. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
During the first quarter ended 31 December 2008, the Company announced a global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The results from continuing operations included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share) for this plan. This charge included $120.0 for severance and pension-related costs. The Company will eliminate approximately 1,400 positions, or about seven percent of its global workforce. The reductions are targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the Company's technology and business development spending, and lowering its plant operating costs. The remainder of the charge, $54.2, is for business exits and asset management actions. Assets held for sale were written down to net realizable value and an environmental liability of $16.0 was recognized. This environmental liability results from a decision to sell a production facility. The planned actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented.
 
For additional historical information on these discontinued operations, refer to the Company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K.
U.S. Healthcare
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business. In April 2009, the Company signed a contract to divest approximately half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business and expects to conclude the sale of the remaining portions of this business in 2009.
In the first quarter of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share) reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Also, a tax benefit of $8.8, or $.04 per share, was recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit related to previously recognized impairment charges.
As a result of events occurring during the second quarter of 2009, which increased the Company's ability to realize tax benefits associated with the impairment charges recorded in 2008, the Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $16.7, or $.08 per share.
Additional charges may be recorded in future periods dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition.
The operating results of the U.S. Healthcare business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
 
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 31 January 2008, the Company sold its Polymers Emulsions business to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of the agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax).
In the second quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business generated sales of $78.8 and income from operations, net of tax, of $3.3. For the six months ended 31 March 2008, sales were $230.0 and income from operations, net of tax, was $10.1.
HPPC Business
In the first quarter of 2008, the HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.2. The Company closed on the sale of its HPPC business on 31 December 2007.
4. CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY
On 6 January 2009, a customer of the Company began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This company receives product principally from the Tonnage Gases segment. At 31 March 2009, the Company had outstanding net receivables with the customer of $37.3. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment's results. At the present time, the Company does not expect any material charges related to long-term assets associated with this customer bankruptcy.
5. PENSION SETTLEMENT
A number of corporate officers and others who were eligible for supplemental pension plan benefits retired in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. Based on the timing of when cash payments were made, the Company recognized $26.3 and $27.7 in the three and six months ended 31 March 2008, respectively. The Company expects to recognize settlement charges in the second half of 2009.
6. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company's outstanding common stock. During the six months ended 31 March 2009, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 31 March 2009, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remains.
 
7. SUMMARY BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to service a specific customer are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with EITF No. 01-08, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease," and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's capital expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 22, 2009)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported income from continuing operations of $115 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $0.54, for its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2009. These results included charges of $110 million, or $0.51 per share, for the company's global cost reduction plan, a customer bankruptcy and other asset actions, and a pension settlement.
Excluding the impact of these items, income from continuing operations was $225 million and diluted EPS was $1.05, down 24 and 22 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year.
Approximately three-quarters of the fiscal third quarter global cost reduction plan is for severance and pension costs related to the elimination of approximately 1,150 positions from the company's global workforce. These reductions are targeted at continued cost and productivity efforts, including closure of certain manufacturing facilities. The remainder is for a write-down of certain assets held for sale to net realizable value.
The global cost reduction plan is expected to reduce fixed costs by approximately $30 million in fiscal 2010, with annual benefits of $50 million in fiscal 2011 and beyond.
The discussion of third quarter results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. It excludes the impacts of the above items. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Third quarter revenues of $1,976 million decreased 28 percent from the prior year on weaker volumes, lower energy and raw material cost pass-throughs, and unfavorable currency. Underlying sales were down 11 percent. Operating income of $308 million declined 22 percent from the prior year on weaker volumes and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by lower operating and overhead costs.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "While we are still seeing the impact of the global recession on our volumes, we've seen signs of improvement during this quarter in some of our end markets, particularly in Electronics and Asia. The productivity and continuous improvement efforts of our employees are having an impact, as margins improved substantially both sequentially and versus prior year."
 
Third Quarter Segment Performance
Outlook
McGlade said, "The global recession remains challenging; however, we believe the actions we are taking to drive improvement in costs are positioning the company for continued margin improvement. We are focused on and remain committed to achieving our 17 percent margin goal."
Air Products now expects fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.04 and $1.14 per share and full-year EPS from continuing operations to be between $3.95 and $4.05 per share, excluding the impact of disclosed items in the fiscal first and third quarters.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this press release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors, including, without limitation, longer than anticipated delay in global economic recovery; renewed deterioration in economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company's products, future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; the effects of a pandemic or epidemic or a natural disaster; charges related to current portfolio management and cost reduction actions; the success of implementing cost reduction programs and achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company's foreign operations; the impact of new or changed environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting standards; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized and other risk factors described in the Company's Form 10K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.

(Millions of dollars)
1. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
Third Quarter 2009
During the third quarter ended 30 June 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan which resulted in a charge to continuing operations of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share).
This charge included $90.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 1,150 positions of its global workforce. The reductions are targeted at continued cost reduction and productivity efforts, including the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. An impairment charge of $34.0 was recorded to write-down certain assets held for sale to net realizable value.
The planned actions associated with the third quarter charge are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
First Quarter 2009
During the first quarter ended 31 December 2008, the Company announced a global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The results from continuing operations in the first quarter included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share).
This charge included $120.0 for severance and pension-related costs, associated with eliminating approximately 1,400 positions from its global workforce. The reductions are targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the Company's technology and business development spending, and lowering its plant operating costs. The remainder of this charge, $54.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. Assets held for sale were written down to net realizable value and an environmental liability of $16.0 was recognized. This environmental liability resulted from a decision to sell a production facility.
The planned actions associated with the first quarter 2009 charge are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented.
For additional historical information on these discontinued operations, refer to the Company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K.
 
U.S. Healthcare
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business.
In the first quarter of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share) reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Also, a tax benefit of $8.8, or $.04 per share, was recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit related to previously recognized impairment charges.
As a result of events which occurred during the second quarter of 2009, which increased the Company's ability to realize tax benefits associated with the impairment charges recorded in 2008, the Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $16.7, or $.08 per share.
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business to OptionCare Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Walgreen Co., and Landauer-Metropolitan, Inc. (LMI) for cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from these sales combined with adjustments to the net realizable value of the remaining businesses. The Company expects to conclude the sale of the remaining portions of this business in 2009.
The operating results of the U.S. Healthcare business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 31 January 2008, the Company sold its Polymer Emulsions business to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax).
On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company's Polymer Emulsions business.
 
The operating results of the Polymer Emulsions business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
HPPC Business
In the first quarter of 2008, the HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.2. The Company closed on the sale of its HPPC business on 31 December 2007.
3. CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY AND ASSET ACTIONS
As a result of events which occurred during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a $22.2 charge primarily for the write-off of certain receivables due to a customer bankruptcy. This customer, who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment, began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 6 January 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment's results. At 30 June 2009, the Company had remaining outstanding receivables with the customer of $16.4. At the present time, the Company does not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer.
Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $9.9 for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share).
4. PENSION SETTLEMENT
The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. Based on the timing of when cash payments were made, the Company recognized an $8.0 ($5.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) charge in the third quarter of 2009. An additional $2 to $3 for settlement losses is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the three and nine months ended 30 June 2008, the Company recognized $1.0 and $28.7 ($17.9 after-tax, or $.08 per share) of settlement charges, respectively.
 
5. SUMMARY BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to service a specific customer are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with EITF No. 01-08, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease," and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's capital expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

Highlights:
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 21, 2009)  Air Products today reported income from continuing operations of $246 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.14, for its fiscal 2009 fourth quarter versus $273 million and $1.26, respectively, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,129 million declined 22 percent versus prior year. Lower energy and raw material cost pass-throughs and unfavorable currency impacted sales by 12 percent and three percent, respectively. Underlying sales declined seven percent on lower volumes in the Merchant Gases and Electronic and Performance Materials segments, and lower pricing in Electronics and Performance Materials. Sequentially, sales were up eight percent, seven percent on an underlying basis. Operating income of $328 million declined 12 percent on lower volumes and unfavorable currency, partially offset by cost reduction actions. Sequentially, operating income increased seven percent, primarily on improved volumes.
The following discussion of full year results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.
For fiscal 2009, sales of $8,256 million declined 21 percent on lower volumes, lower energy and raw material cost pass-throughs and unfavorable currency. Underlying sales declined eight percent. Operating income of $1,185 million was down 22 percent, and diluted EPS of $4.06 declined 20 percent from the prior year.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The beginning of our fiscal 2009 coincided with the start of the global financial crisis, driving the recession that resulted in unprecedented declines in demand for our products worldwide. While this affected our fiscal year results, we were able to offset some of the decline with
 
aggressive cost controls. Sequentially, we are seeing volume improvement in all our businesses, and our actions to move to a sustainable, low-cost structure have positioned us to capitalize on growth as our markets recover."
Fourth Quarter Segment Performance
Outlook
Looking forward, McGlade said, "We have implemented the difficult but necessary actions to take advantage of our strong global market positions. Additionally, we see significant future opportunities in the evolving energy, environment, and emerging market sectors. We also continue to drive to a low-cost structure to enable us to grow faster than our competition. While the pace of the recovery is unknown, our people remain committed to achieving our margin, return and growth goals. "
The company today announced initial guidance for fiscal year 2010 EPS in the range of $4.65 to $4.90 per share, representing year-over-year earnings growth on a continuing operations basis of 15 to 21 percent. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ending December 31, 2009, EPS is expected to be between $1.07 and $1.15 per share.
The company also announced that it expects capital spending in fiscal 2010 to be between $1.3 and $1.5 billion, approximately equal to fiscal 2009.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this press release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors, including, without limitation, longer than anticipated delay in global economic recovery; renewed deterioration in economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company's products, future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; the effects of a pandemic or epidemic or a natural disaster; charges related to current portfolio management and cost reduction actions; the success of implementing cost reduction programs and achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company's foreign operations; the impact of new or changed environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting standards; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized and other risk factors described in the Company's Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.

The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate the Company's baseline performance. Presented below is a reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures.
(Millions of dollars, except for share data)
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to service a specific customer are required to be accounted for as capital leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars)
1. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The first quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan which resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share).
The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from its global workforce. The reductions are targeted at reducing overhead and infrastructure costs, reducing and refocusing elements of the Company's technology and business development spending, lowering its plant operating costs, and the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. Assets held for sale were written down to net realizable value and an environmental liability of $16.0 was recognized. This environmental liability resulted from a decision to sell a production facility.
The planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan are expected to be substantially completed within one year of when the related charges were recognized.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and the High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented.
For additional historical information on these discontinued operations, refer to the Company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K.
U.S. Healthcare
In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business.
In the first quarter of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share) reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Also, a tax benefit of $8.8, or $.04 per share, was recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit related to previously recognized impairment charges.
As a result of events which occurred during the second quarter of 2009, which increased the Company's ability to realize tax benefits associated with the impairment charges recorded in 2008, the Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $16.7, or $.08 per share.
 
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business to OptionCare Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Walgreen Co., and Landauer-Metropolitan, Inc. (LMI) for cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from these sales combined with adjustments to the net realizable value of the remaining businesses.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions with Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and with LMI, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business.
The operating results of the U.S. Healthcare business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
Polymer Emulsions Business
On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG's interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax).
On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company's Polymer Emulsions business.
 
The operating results of the Polymer Emulsions business have been classified as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
3. CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY AND ASSET ACTIONS
As a result of events which occurred during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a $22.2 charge primarily for the write-off of certain receivables due to a customer bankruptcy. This customer, who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment, began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 6 January 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment's results. At 30 September 2009, the Company had remaining outstanding receivables with the customer of $16.3. At the present time, the Company does not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer.
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.9 for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share).
4. PENSION SETTLEMENT
The Company's supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers six months after the participant's retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. Based on the timing of when cash payments were made, the Company recognized $2.7 and $10.7 ($6.7 after-tax, or $.03 per share) of settlement charges for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2009, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2008, the Company recognized $1.6 and $30.3 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) of settlement charges, respectively.
 
5. LOSS FROM PROPERTY DAMAGE
In the fourth quarter of 2008, a fire at the Company's Ulsan, Korea nitrogen trifluoride (NF) production facility required the plant to be shut down. Other income (expense) for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2008 included a net loss of $14.7 ($10.7 after-tax, or $.05 per share) related to property damage. The net book value of the damaged property was written off and a receivable was recorded for expected property damage insurance recoveries.
3
During fiscal 2009, the Company received the expected insurance recoveries for property damage of $3.7. Additionally, the Company recorded other income of $4.9 ($3.1 after-tax, or $.01 per share) comprised of $2.3 for the receipt of additional proceeds from a business interruption claim and a $2.6 adjustment to the book value of the damaged property.
6. HURRICANES
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike reduced short-term demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast customers and drove temporary decreases in operational costs. The net impact on fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $.05.
 
7. SUMMARY BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to service a specific customer are required to be accounted for as capital leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's capital expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

On December 10, 2009, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Proxy Statement for its 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held on January 28, 2010. The Company has been requested to provide additional information with respect to its Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which shareholders are requested to approve at the Annual Meeting.
On page 10 of the Proxy Statement, the Company disclosed that, as of its fiscal year end, September 30, 2009, 7,208,358 stock options granted under the Plan had been outstanding in excess of six years with a weighted average exercise price of $39.68. The following table provides additional information regarding these stock options:
 
To illustrate the intrinsic value of the stock options detailed above during the period after vesting, the New York Stock Exchange closing price for each fiscal year-end, beginning with the first grant date above, was as follows:
 
The chart below reflects the Company's five-year total shareholder return as of 30 September 2009:
Page 9 of the Proxy Statement discloses that, as of September 30, 2009, 3,629,182 previously authorized shares were still available for awards under the Plan. As also noted, no more than 20% of the shares of Company stock subject to Plan awards granted after fiscal year 2001 can be used for full value awards ("20% limit"). As of September 30, 2009, less than 12% of shares used for Plan awards since 2001 were used for full value awards. Because the 20% limit is cumulative, and less than 20% of shares subject to awards granted since 2001 have been used for full value awards, 2,757,837 of the authorized shares still available for use under the Plan could be used for full value awards under the terms of the Plan.

Highlights
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 22, 2010)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $252 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.16, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2009 versus $69 million and $0.32 for the fiscal first quarter of 2009.
The discussion of first quarter results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons due to last year's restructuring charge. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
First quarter revenues of $2,174 million declined one percent as lower energy and raw material cost pass-through offset higher volumes and favorable currency. Operating income of $345 million was up 20 percent from the prior year on improved volumes in Tonnage Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials, broad productivity gains across the company and favorable currency impacts. Sequentially, sales improved two percent while operating income gained five percent.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are off to a good start in fiscal 2010. Our earnings per share grew 20% and we continued our margin improvement putting us on track to meet our 17% goal in 2011. Both our sequential and year-over-year results benefited from an improving global economy and our efforts to move Air Products to a sustainable, low cost structure."
First Quarter Segment Performance
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "We believe we will see continued earnings growth throughout 2010 as the global economy, led by Asia, continues its gradual recovery, and as we drive further cost reductions. We also had a significant number of new business signings in the first quarter and are very excited by the opportunities we see for growth beyond 2010."
Air Products is raising its guidance for fiscal 2010 to $4.75 to $4.95 per share. The company also expects second quarter EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.15 and $1.20 per share.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
(a) Other income includes foreign exchange losses in the amount of $.5 and $6.5 for the three months ended 31 December 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
Noncontrolling Interests
Effective 1 October 2009, the Company adopted the accounting guidance that established the accounting and reporting standard for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheets. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated statement of income, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests. The Company's financial statements have been updated to reflect the new presentation. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

Strength Across All Distribution Channels
 
Air Products Expects Synergies of $250 Million and Immediate Earnings Accretion
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (February 5, 2010)  Air Products (NYSE: APD) today announced that it has made an offer to acquire Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) for $60.00 per share in cash. The offer was made in a letter to Airgas Board of Directors yesterday after the CEOs of the two companies had previously discussed Air Products interest in acquiring Airgas and after Air Products had made two written offers, and these offers and Air Products requests to discuss them were rejected by Airgas.
 
At $60.00 per share, the offer provides a 38% premium to Airgas shareholders based on yesterdays closing price of $43.53 and is 18% above Airgas 52-week high. The total value of the transaction is approximately $7.0 billion, including $5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billon of assumed debt. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Air Products earnings per share on both a GAAP and cash basis, excluding expected one-time costs.
 
Air Products offer fully values Airgas complementary capabilities and attractive long-term prospects. Headquartered in Pennsylvania, the combined company would be the largest industrial gas company in North America and one of the largest in the world, with distinctive strengths across all geographies and in all three distribution channels: packaged gases, liquid bulk and tonnage. A combination of the two companies would be financially and strategically compelling, with substantial cost synergies of $250 million by the end of year two, and the ability to accelerate growth both domestically and internationally by leveraging Airgas extensive U.S. sales force and packaged gases skills on the foundation of Air Products global presence and infrastructure.
 
Air Products is fully committed to pursuing this transaction, and has secured committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the offer. Air Products is prepared to make appropriate divestitures to address regulatory issues.
 
John E. McGlade, Air Products chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, This is an extremely compelling transaction with undeniable strategic and industrial logic that would benefit shareholders, customers and employees of both companies. Bringing together these two highly complementary companies would create substantial value. We highly value the talented operating team at Airgas, and believe they would benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available to them as part of a larger and stronger global U.S. company with significantly greater long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas. While we are disappointed that Airgas has thus far prevented its shareholders from receiving a substantial premium and immediate liquidity, we have repeatedly communicated to the Airgas Board our willingness to improve our offer to reflect any incremental value they can demonstrate. While it remains our strong desire to reach an agreement with Airgas on a friendly basis, we are fully committed to pursuing this transaction and are prepared to take all necessary steps to complete it, including making an offer directly to Airgas shareholders.

Below is the full text of the most recent letter from Air Products to Airgas:
 
February 4, 2010
 
Mr. Peter McCausland
Chairman, President and CEO
Airgas, Inc.
259 North Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 100
Radnor, PA 19087-5283
 
Dear Peter:
 
As you know, we have been trying for the last four months to engage Airgas in friendly discussions regarding a business combination. We are deeply disappointed that you and your board have rejected out of hand two written offers providing your shareholders substantial premiums. In our prior correspondence, we clearly and repeatedly stated our flexibility as to both value and form of consideration, yet you have continued to refuse even to discuss our offers. Your unwillingness to engage has delayed the ability of your shareholders to receive a substantial premium. We remain committed to completing this transaction, and we have therefore decided to inform your shareholders of our offer to expedite the process.
 
Air Products is prepared to proceed with a fully financed, all-cash offer for all Airgas shares
at $60.00 per share, which reflects a premium of 38% to Airgas closing price today of
$43.53 and 18% above its 52-week high. In addition to a substantial premium, Airgas
shareholders will benefit from immediate liquidity in an uncertain economic environment
through an offer which we believe fully values Airgas complementary capabilities and long-
term growth prospects.
 
- more-
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bringing together our complementary skills and strengths will create one of the worlds leading integrated industrial gas companies. Combining Air Products global leadership in liquid bulk and tonnage gases with Airgas leadership in U.S. packaged gases will create the largest industrial gas company in North America and one of the largest globally  a leader with distinctive strengths and world-class competencies across all distribution channels and geographies. While we have a strong and profitable packaged gas business in Europe and other key international markets, we do not have a position in the U.S. packaged gas business where Airgas is the market leader. As part of this uniquely compelling combination, Airgas would be well positioned to achieve higher growth than it could achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We do not believe there are any significant financial or regulatory impediments to your shareholders timely realization of this substantial cash premium. We have secured committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the offer and are committed to maintaining a robust capital structure. We have also thoroughly considered the regulatory issues related to this combination and are prepared to make appropriate divestitures, none of which we expect to be material.
 
The strategic and industrial logic of this combination is clear, and we are confident that an Air Products/Airgas combination would create greater value than Airgas or Air Products could each achieve on its own. There are many advantages to consummating this combination now, including:
 
 
 
We believe the timing for this combination is ideal. The economy is just beginning to emerge from recession, and together we would be able to take full advantage of the substantial growth potential, economies of scale, and synergies unique to this transaction. You have made clear your international growth aspirations, which will require significant time and expense to build out on your own. Air Products has the global infrastructure in place that would allow you to achieve your goals faster and better. Airgas is also just in the initial stages of implementing SAP, and our demonstrated expertise in this area would greatly reduce the time, expense and disruption associated with this vital rollout.
 
Bringing our two companies together would also benefit employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. We highly value the talented operating team at Airgas, which would benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available as part of a larger and stronger global U.S. company headquartered in Pennsylvania -- with significantly greater long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas. Your customers would benefit from a more robust product offering from a company with expanded resources and global scope.

Peter, let me reemphasize as I have in past discussions that Air Products is fully committed to the successful completion of this compelling transaction. Your continuing refusal to engage with us will serve only to further delay your shareholders ability to receive a substantial all-cash premium. While we would strongly prefer to proceed through friendly negotiations, you should not doubt our resolve to take the necessary actions to complete this transaction. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or with any special committee of your independent directors which has been or will be formed to consider our offer, as well as their independent financial and legal advisors. Finally, we reiterate our willingness to reflect in our offer any incremental value you can demonstrate.
 
Very Truly Yours,
 
John E. McGlade
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products), by and through its undersigned attorneys, files this verified complaint (the Complaint) against Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), and Peter McCausland, James W. Hovey, Paula A. Sneed, David M. Stout, Ellen C. Wolf, W. Thacher Brown, Richard C. Ill, Lee M. Thomas and John C. van Roden, Jr. (collectively, the Defendant Directors) upon knowledge as to matters relating to itself and upon information and belief as to all other matters, and alleges as follows:
 
1.           Today, February 4, 2010, Air Products publicly announced a non-discriminatory, all-cash offer (the Proposed Transaction) to purchase all outstanding Airgas shares for $60 per sharea 38% premium to todays closing price of $43.53.  The offer is supported by committed financing.  Air Products is offering Airgass shareholders consideration equal to the full pre-offer market capitalization of Airgas an additional $1.35 billion, all in cash.  Moreover, Air Products has committed to increasing its offer price to reflect any incremental value demonstrated by Airgas and to taking the other steps necessary to close a deal.
plus
 
 
2.           The only obstacles standing between Airgass shareholders and due consideration of this high-premium offer are the shareholders own entrusted fiduciariesthe Defendant Directors.  For months, Air Products has sought to engage the Defendant Directors to present its case for combining Airgass North American packaged gas business with Air Products global tonnage and liquid bulk gas businesses, creating a premier gas company across all geographies and distribution channels.  In its overtures, Air Products has consistently stressed its flexibility on both the price and the form of consideration that Airgass shareholders would receive.  But the Defendant Directorsled by Airgass founder, President, largest shareholder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Peter McCauslandhave refused even to meet with Air Products representatives to investigate and understand the proposal in any detail.  Upon information and belief, this just say no defensive posture is calculated to entrench McCausland as Chief Executive and Chairman and to protect the other Defendant Directors positions in Airgas, at the sacrifice of the unique and valuable opportunity offered to Airgass shareholders.
3.           Air Products brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the Defendant Directors to fulfill their fiduciary duties.  Air Products is proposing a transaction that is non-coercive, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and priced at a large premium to Airgass pre-offer market value today and its 52-week high.  As such, it is in the best interests of Airgas shareholders for this offer to be, at the very least, considered and negotiated by a special committee of Airgass independent directors advised by independent financial and legal advisors.  The Defendant Directors refusal even to form an independent committee and to discuss the proposal with Air Products constitutes an unreasonable response to Air Products proposal, one that violates the Defendant Directors fiduciary duties under Delaware law.  The Defendant Directors cannot inform themselves concerning, or properly assess, the Air Products proposal, consistent with their duty of care, without meeting with Air Products either directly or through advisors.  The Defendant Directors just say no reflexive response, apparently at the behest of their Chairman, represents a violation of their duty of loyalty to Airgas shareholders.

A.           
The Proposed Transaction Would Fuel Higher Growth
16.           Air Products has been pursuing a business combination with Airgas for approximately four months. Air Products decided to approach Airgas after Air Products management and Board of Directors determined that such a combination would foster growth and shareholder returns superior to those of the respective companies on their own.  A key driver of that assessment, in addition to the combination of world-class competencies and cost synergies, was the highly complementary nature of the two businesses.
 
 
 
4
 
 
17.           Air Products and Airgas are comparatively strong in different areas.  Air Products was founded by the late Leonard P. Pool in 1940 on a simple but revolutionary idea: the concept of on-site production and sales of industrial gases. At the time, gas was sold to even the largest consumers only in cylinders. Pool built gas generating facilities adjacent to large-volume gas users, thereby reducing distribution costs.  Today, Air Products is a leader in the delivery of tonnage gas (, gas delivered via pipeline) and liquid bulk gas (, gas delivered via tanker trucks).  On the other hand, the heart of Airgass businessbuilt through over 400 acquisitionsis the delivery of packaged gas (, gas delivered via small cylinders and dewars) to small-volume industrial, medical, and specialty users.  Combining these two businesses would marry Air Products leading bulk infrastructure, engineering, and low-cost supply with Airgass leading packaged gas distribution and sales systems.  The result: the leading gas company in America, able to offer a wide variety of gas products more efficiently and at lower cost.
i.e.
i.e.
i.e.
18.           Air Products analysis also revealed that the two companies are geographically complementary.  Air Products has invested heavily in producing a world-wide gas infrastructure, to the point that today Air Products earns a majority of its revenue from international sales.  Airgass packaged gas business, on the other hand, is primarily confined to the United States.  Though Airgas has signaled its desire to expand internationally, building out the necessary infrastructure is slow and costly.  A combination with Air Products would immediately provide a preexisting infrastructure for Airgass business to expand.

19.           Air Products concluded that the combined company would:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20.           As a standalone company, Airgass performance has faltered.  On January 28, 2010, Airgas publicly announced its fiscal third quarter results.  The market was surprised by a 25% fall in Airgass earnings from the same quarter last year, which translated to reported earnings lower than the low-end of the earnings guidance Airgas had previously issued.  Airgas also lowered its future earnings targets.
21.           Another benefit arising from the complementary, rather than overlapping, nature of Air Products and Airgass businesses is the mitigation of regulatory concerns.  Before approaching Airgas, Air Products carefully assessed regulatory issues that might arise and determined that any such issues can be addressed through limited, identifiable remedies.  In particular, Air Products concluded that a number of credible buyers exist for businesses and facilities that might be at issue, a conclusion bolstered by the fact that these assets are capable of being operated on a standalone or bolt-on basis. Indeed, the very assets likely to be divested, to a significant extent, have previously been bought and sold between gas companies.  As repeatedly communicated to Airgas, Air Products stands prepared to share the results of its regulatory analyses once representatives from the two companies meet.

22.           Air Products management is experienced in running packaged gas businesses.  For example, Air Products currently operates a large and successful European packaged gas business and a growing Asian packaged gas business, both of which would serve as platforms for Airgass growth in these areas.  Moreover, Air Products previously operated a packaged gas business in the United States. This business, which at the time held a modest share of domestic sales, and had limited breadth and scope, was sold to Airgas in 2002.  As Air Products representatives explained at that time, rather than invest its capital in building out this mode of supply, the company instead sought to focus on growing its tonnage (particularly hydrogen) and liquid bulk businesses.  With those objectives largely accomplished, a combination with Airgas now would produce a company with first-class competencies across all three modes of supply.
 
 
23.           On October 15, 2009, the Chief Executive Officers of Air Products (John E. McGlade) and Airgas (Peter McCausland) met at Airgass headquarters. McGlade suggested the meeting that week to discuss a business proposal. At the meeting, McGlade indicated that Air Products was interested in pursuing a business combination with Airgas in a stock-for-stock deal that would value Airgas at a substantial premium to its then market price and allow Airgas shareholders to share in the value created by the combination.
24.           McGlade told McCausland that careful study had convinced Air Products managers and directors that joining forces with Airgas would create a premier industrial gas company.  Through geographic and business diversification, cost savings, and highly complementary business capabilities, shareholders of both companies could expect to reap significant additional returns.

25.           After hearing McGlades proposal to join ranks, and Air Products rationale behind it, McCausland said that the timing was not right.
26.           In response, McGlade stressed that, in Air Products view, the best time for a transaction was now. Among other reasons: (1) the economy was emerging from a recession, which created a window to integrate the companies and achieve synergies at lower cost; (2) Airgas is just beginning to implement SAP software systemsa notoriously time-consuming and expensive processand Air Products could share its seven years of experience implementing SAP; and (3) Airgas is likely to begin spending capital on an international infrastructure, a costly expense that would be made unnecessary by a merger with Air Products extensive global infrastructure.
27.           Accordingly, McGlade asked McCausland to discuss Air Products proposal with Airgass Board of Directors and signaled his intent to put Air Products offer in writing.  McCausland remained noncommittal but asked that nothing be sent to him in writing.
28.           On October 31, 2009, one week before Airgas was scheduled to hold its Board of Directors annual retreat, McGlade called McCausland to reaffirm Air Products commitment to a transaction and the expectation that the offer would be presented to, and duly considered by, Airgass Board. McCausland responded that he doubted that the Board of Directors would view the proposal differently than he did and again asked that nothing be sent to him in writing.
29.           In early November, the Airgas Board of Directors held its retreat. A few days after the Defendant Directors concluded the multi-day meetings, McCausland returned McGlades call.  Despite the high-premium offer available to Airgass shareholders, McCausland stated that the Defendant Directors had no interest in even exploring the proposal, and rejected the invitation to further discuss it.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors failed even to form a special committee of independent directors with independent advisors to evaluate the offer.  The Defendant Directors rejected the offer as undervalued, despite its high premium to Airgass market price and despite knowing that Airgas was performing below its own guidance to the market.

30.           On November 19, 2009, at a meeting of Air Products directors, McGlade reported on Airgass response to Air Products overture.  The Air Products Board of Directors resolved to authorize McGlade to make a written offer to Airgas.
31.           The next day, McGlade sent a letter to McCausland setting out the basic terms of Air Products offer.  Exhibit A hereto.  Air Products offered to acquire all of Airgass outstanding shares for $60 per share in an all-stock transaction, equivalent to 0.7296 shares of Air Products common stock based on its then-current market price.  That afternoon, Airgass stock closed trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $47.05 per share.  Thus, the offers nearly $13 extra per share represented a premium of 27.5% to the market price of Airgass stock.
See
32.           In his letter, McGlade reiterated what he had told McCausland orally: that combining Air Products global leadership in liquid bulk and tonnage gases with Airgass leadership in North American packaged gases would unleash faster earnings growth, both domestically and internationally.
33.           McGlade also wrote that Air Products was ready and willing to negotiate with Airgas if Airgas found the offer unsatisfactory. In particular, Air Products has consistently stated that it will share any additional value that Airgas identifies with Airgass shareholders, and the November 20 letter reiterated that point:

34.           In a November 25 letter, McCausland responded to the written offer tersely.  Exhibit B hereto.  McCausland wrote that Airgass Board would meet in early December to consider Air Products offer and that McCausland would contact McGlade after the meeting.
See
35.           On December 8, 2009, McCausland wrote to McGlade that the Defendant Directors had considered Air Products offer and rejected it.  Exhibit C hereto. According to McCausland, the Defendant Directors concluded that Air Products was undervaluing Airgas and that Air Products stock was a currency that [was] not attractive.   at 1.  For those reasons, the Defendant Directors purportedly had no interest in pursuing the possible benefits of such a deal for Airgass shareholders.    Upon information and belief, the offer was not considered by a special committee of independent directors advised by independent advisors.  And the Defendant Directors concluded that Air Products offerdespite its high premium to Airgass market priceundervalued Airgas, despite knowing that Airgass results in the fiscal third quarter would be below market expectations.

Id.
Id.
36.           The Defendant Directors not only rejected the premium offer, but also flatly stated that they had no interest in even continuing a dialogue between the two companies, despite Air Products stated willingness to modify the terms of its offer in response to any demonstration that there is value in Airgas which Air Products is overlooking.  Instead, McCausland told McGlade that the Defendant Directors do not believe that any purpose would be served by having the companies or their advisors meet.   at 2.  The Defendant Directors did not propose a counter-offer to Air Products original offer or tell Air Products why they value Airgass stock so differently than do the buyers and sellers of Airgass highly liquid stock trading in an efficient market.
Id.

37.           Air Products remained committed to pursuing an acquisition of Airgas that would maximize shareholder value and improve the performance of both companies.  In a letter dated December 17, 2009, McGlade informed McCausland that, in a good faith effort to start discussions between the two companies, Air Products was raising its offer to $62 per share.  Exhibit D hereto.  To address the Defendant Directors purported concerns about the attractiveness of Air Products stock, Air Products also offered to fund up to half the purchase in cash. Air Products revised offer now represented a 33% premium to Airgass closing price on the New York Stock Exchange that day.
See
38.           Additionally, McGlade yet again communicated that Air Products would work flexibly with Airgas to reach a mutually acceptable deal, including on price: If you believe that there is incremental value above and beyond our increased offer, we stand willing to listen and to understand your points on value with a view to sharing increased value appropriately with the Airgas shareholders.   at 5.  Believing that a continued exchange of letters could not adequately communicate the details of and rationale for Air Products offer, McGlade requested a meeting among the Boards and advisors of each company as soon as possible to explore additional sources of value in Airgas.  
Id.

39.           Shortly thereafter, the Defendant Directors again summarily rejected Air Products offer, without a good faith evaluation of its benefits for Airgass shareholders and without any attempt to investigate or negotiate its terms.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors continued to fail to form a special committee of independent directors advised by independent advisors.  Instead, on January 4, 2010, McCausland wrote to inform McGlade that the Defendant Directors had purportedly met and concluded that Air Products was  undervaluing Airgasdespite Airgass flexible offer being set at a large premium.   Exhibit E hereto.  In his letter, McCausland shut down any exploration of this unique opportunity for Airgass shareholders: [T]he Board is not interested in pursuing your companys proposal and continues to believe that there is no reason to meet.

40.           Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors rejections of Air Products proposals were delivered while they had knowledge that Airgass financial results for the fiscal third quarter (, the quarter ending December 31, 2009) would be disappointing and would cause a drop in the market price of Airgass shares.  This became evident on January 28, 2010, when Airgas publicly announced that its fiscal third quarter earnings were below the lowest range of the earnings guidance it had given to the market, and also lowered its future earnings guidance.
i.e.
 
41.           Since January 4, the Defendant Directors have continued their unreasonable rejections of Air Products offer to Airgass shareholders.  Air Products advisors have called Airgass advisors and reaffirmed Air Products willingness to negotiate.  Through their advisors, the Defendant Directors have continued to refuse engagement.  On February 1, Air Products advisors made one last attempt to persuade the Defendant Directors, through their advisors, to engage in discussions. Airgass legal advisors responded that the Defendant Directors position on a meeting with Air Products had not and would not change. Airgass financial advisors responded that there is a regularly-scheduled meeting of Airgass Board of Directors set for next week, but refused to reveal what date the Board meeting is actually scheduled and gave no indication that the Board would be addressing Air Products repeated proposals.  None of Airgass advisors even suggested a willingness to meet with Air Products or its advisors or to otherwise discuss the possibility of a transaction.
 
 
12
 
 
42.           Today, February 4, 2010, Air Products sent a letter to the Defendant Directors reiterating its proposal to combine with Airgas, with the hope that the Defendant Directors will finally begin to fulfill their fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders.   Exhibit F hereto.  Because of the increased costs associated with a non-negotiated deal, and because the current offer is now an all-cash offer with committed financing from J.P. Morgan (which entails additional costs such as financing commitment fees), Air Products is offering $60 per share in cash. The Defendant Directors unreasonable responses to the offer have imposed costs that will be borne by Airgass shareholders unless the Defendant Directors start to put their shareholders first. At $60 per share, a 38% premium to Airgass pre-offer market value, the Proposed Transaction presents Airgass shareholders with a very compelling opportunity.
See
43.           The fact that the offer is now all cash negates any purported concern on the Defendant Directors part as to the value of Air Products shares as currency or as to the future performance of the combined company, unfounded as they may be.  Air Products has thus demonstrated its willingness to be responsive to the Defendant Directors concerns, and in its current offer letter Air Products has reiterated its willingness to engage in good-faith negotiations and to adjust its offer to reflect any incremental value in Airgas that can be demonstrated.
 
 
13
 
44.           Airgas has a Shareholders Rights Plan (poison pill) and has not opted out of 8 Del. C.  203.  A refusal on the part of the Defendant Directors to take appropriate action relating to the poison pill and Section 203 will prevent Airgas shareholders from receiving the benefits of Air Products offer.  The actions of the Defendant Directors thus far, as reported by Mr. McCausland, suggest that the Defendant Directors will refuse to take the appropriate action, and may not form a special committee of independent directors, advised by independent advisors, to consider the Air Products offer and to consider whether to engage in discussions with Air Products.
 
45.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
46.           Air Products has no adequate remedy at law. Only through the exercise of the Courts equitable powers will Air Products and Airgass shareholders be protected from irreparable injury.  Absent equitable relief from the Court, Air Products will be precluded from consummating the Proposed Transaction and Airgass shareholders will be deprived of the opportunity to sell their shares to Air Products at a substantial premium.  Should that occur, Air Products will have lost the unique opportunity to acquire Airgas, and Airgas shareholders will have lost a unique opportunity to maximize value.
 
 
47.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
 
 
14
 
 
48.           The Defendant Directors owe fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders, including the duty to act with due care and the utmost good faith and loyalty.
49.           The Proposed Transaction is all-cash, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and for all of Airgass shares. It is non-coercive and negotiable, is fair to Airgass shareholders, and poses no threat to its corporate policy and effectiveness.  The Proposed Transaction represents a substantial premium (38%) over todays closing price for Airgass common stock.
50.           Peter McCausland, Airgass President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, is not an independent, outside, or disinterested director.  Seeking to entrench himself, he has not recused himself from the Board of Directors responses to Air Products proposals, but has instead dictated them.  The other Defendant Directors, aware of McCauslands interested status, have failed to insist on forming a special committee with independent advisors. Instead, they have sought to entrench themselves and to further McCauslands interests.  The Defendant Directors conduct represents a violation of their duty of loyalty to Airgas shareholders.
51.           The Defendant Directors failed to conduct a good faith and reasonable investigation of the Proposed Transaction. Instead, the Defendant Directors summarily refused to engage Air Products in a meaningful dialogue and failed to reasonably inform themselves about the Proposed Transaction.  The Defendant Directors could not possibly be well informed concerning the offers to which they have just said no without at least engaging in discussion, either directly or through advisors, to learn more about Air Products offer and how flexible Air Products might be in response to any showing of incremental value in Airgas.  This is a violation of the Defendant Directors duty of care.
 
 
15
 
 
52.           The Defendant Directors refusal to negotiate with Air Products deprives Airgass shareholders of the opportunity to sell their Airgas shares at a substantial premium and, accordingly, to maximize the value of their shares in an uncertain economic environment.
53.           The Defendant Directors failure to adequately consider the Proposed Transaction and to negotiate with Air Products has no economic justification, serves no legitimate purpose, is an unreasonable response to the Proposed Transaction, which poses no threat to the interests of Airgass shareholders, and is a violation of the Defendant Directors duty of loyalty.
54.           The Defendant Directors actions are in breach of the fiduciary duties they owe to Airgass shareholders.
55.           The Defendant Directors conduct threatens to deprive Air Products of the unique opportunity to acquire Airgas.
56.           Air Products has no remedy at law.
 
 
57.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
58.           The Defendant Directors owe fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders, including the duty to act with due care and the utmost good faith and loyalty.
59.           The Proposed Transaction is all-cash, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and for all of Airgass shares. It is non-coercive and negotiable, is fair to Airgass shareholders, and poses no threat to its corporate policy and effectiveness.  Moreover, the Proposed Transaction represents a substantial premium (38%) over todays closing price for Airgass common stock.
 
 
16
 
60.           Air Products seeks an order declaring that the Defendant Directors fiduciary duties require them to form a special committee of independent directors, advised by independent legal and financial advisors, to investigate, consider and negotiate (without impediments) the Proposed Transaction.
61.           Air Products seeks an order declaring that the adoption, maintenance or implementation of any defensive measures by Defendants against the Proposed Transaction, or of any measure that would prevent a future board of directors from exercising its fiduciary duties, would itself constitute a breach of fiduciary duties owed to Airgass shareholders.
62.           Air Products has no remedy at law.
 
63.           WHEREFORE, Air Products respectfully requests that the Court:
     a)           declare that Defendant Directors have breached their fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders by refusing to negotiate with Air Products and to inform themselves of the potential parameters of the offer, and by failing to form a special committee of independent directors, with independent advisors, to consider and negotiate the offer;
   
    b)           compel the Defendant Directors to form a special committee of Airgass independent directors, with its own independent financial and legal advisors, to reasonably consider and negotiate the Proposed Transaction, in good faith;
   
    c)           enjoin the Defendant Directors from engaging in any action or inaction that has the effect of improperly impeding, thwarting, frustrating or interfering with the Proposed Transaction with Air Products in a manner inconsistent with their fiduciary duties;
   
    d)           enjoin Airgas, its employees, agents and all persons acting on its behalf or in concert with it from taking any action that has the effect of impeding Air Products efforts to acquire control of Airgas, in violation of their respective fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders;

Highlights
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 22, 2010)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $267 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.23, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2010. This result excludes an after-tax charge of $15 million, or $0.07 per share, for costs associated with the tender offer for the outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc.
The discussion of second quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons excluding costs associated with the Airgas offer. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Second quarter revenues of $2,249 million grew 15 percent primarily on improved volumes in Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials. Energy and raw material cost pass-through and favorable currency also contributed to the increase in sales. Underlying sales grew nine percent. Operating income of $364 million rose 40 percent from the prior year due to higher volumes and lower costs.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are seeing improvement across our businesses. Our second quarter had strong underlying revenue growth, continued margin improvement and significant earnings growth. We are delivering on our commitments."
Second Quarter Segment Performance
 
Outlook
McGlade said, "I'm particularly pleased with the performance of the Air Products team over the past year. Looking to the second half of our fiscal year, we are forecasting earnings growth in excess of 20 percent for 2010. The gradual economic recovery, combined with the leverage from our existing capacity, new project onstreams and improving productivity should position us well to meet our margin target of 17 percent in fiscal 2011. I want to assure our shareholders we will stay focused on our goals as we pursue the strategic opportunities in front of us."
Air Products now expects third quarter EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.25 and $1.29 per share and full-year EPS from continuing operations of $4.90 to $5.00 per share.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1. AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, specialty gases, and hardgoods. The total value of the transaction would be approximately $7 billion, including $5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billion of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 4 June 2010, unless further extended.
Prior to the tender offer, the Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. An after-tax unrealized holding gain of $16.7 for the period was recorded in other comprehensive income.
In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.
For the second quarter 2010, $23.4 in expense was recognized related to this transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. This includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility and other acquisition-related costs.
2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In the second quarter of 2010, the Company entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the French SAGA group (SAGA) which consists of SAGA, SAGA Medical, and SAGA Technologies. SAGA is an independent industrial gas provider in France with packaged gases, liquid bulk, and medical businesses. SAGA revenues in calendar year 2009 were approximately 25 million, or $35.
Under the terms of these agreements, the Company purchased 51.47% of the shares of SAGA on 1 March 2010 for 34.5 million, or $47.2 ($25.0 net of cash acquired of $22.2). The remaining shares are expected to be purchased in November 2010 for a fixed price of 44.8 million, or approximately $61, under a put and call option structure. This structure has been accounted for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

The 2010 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces the Company's existing $1,450,000,000 revolving credit agreement dated May 23, 2006, as subsequently amended (the "2006 Agreement"). No borrowings were outstanding under the 2006 Agreement at the time of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred.

AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, specialty gases, and hardgoods. On 8 July 2010, the Company increased the value of its tender offer to $63.50 per share. The total value of the transaction approximates $7.3 billion, including $5.5 billion of equity and $1.8 billion of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 13 August 2010, unless further extended.
Prior to the tender offer, the Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. For the nine months ended 30 June 2010, an after-tax unrealized holding gain of $15.4 was recorded in other comprehensive income within total equity on the consolidated balance sheet.
In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement.
For the three and nine months ended 30 June 2010, $37.9 ($23.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) and $61.3 ($38.3 after-tax, or $.18 per share), respectively, in expense was recognized related to this transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. This includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility and other acquisition-related costs.
 
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, specialty gases, and hardgoods. On 6 September 2010, the Company increased the value of its tender offer to $65.50 per share. The total value of the transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 29 October 2010, unless further extended.
In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement.
For the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2010, $34.7 ($21.8 after-tax, or $.10 per share) and $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share), respectively, in expense was recognized related to this transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. This includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility and other acquisition-related costs.
 
 
The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company's management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company's expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

First Quarter Highlights Versus Prior Year
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 21, 2011)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $296 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.35 for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2010 versus $252 million and $1.16 for the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

(April 21, 2011)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $309 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2011. This result excludes a net after-tax cost of $4 million, or $0.02 per share, associated with the now expired tender offer for the outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc.
The discussion of second quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Second quarter revenues of $2,501 million grew 11 percent versus prior year, primarily on higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases segments. Sequential sales were up five percent. Operating income of $425 million improved 17 percent versus prior year and five percent sequentially on increased volumes. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17 percent.
"For the quarter, we had strong growth with double-digit increases in both sales and earnings. This performance, along with our 18 percent dividend increase and $350 million share repurchase, reflects the strength of our business and our belief that shareholders should benefit directly from the improved operating performance of their company," said John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, we commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash, less any required withholding tax. The offer was subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated 11 February 2010, as amended, including Airgas' redemption of the preferred stock purchase rights or such rights otherwise being inapplicable to our purchase of Airgas stock. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and hard goods. On 9 December 2010, we increased the value of our tender offer to $70.00 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would have been approximately $7.8 billion, including $6.1 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. Based on a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the decision of Airgas' board of directors to retain the preferred stock purchase rights, we withdrew our offer on 15 February 2011.
In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. On 3 February 2011, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for an amended $6.7 billion term loan credit facility with a maturity date of 4 June 2011. No additional underwriting fees were incurred in relation to the amended agreement. On 16 February 2011, in connection with the termination of the offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Airgas, the credit facility was terminated. No early termination penalties were incurred and all fees previously accrued and due under the credit facility were paid as of the date of termination.
Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share).
For the three and six months ended 31 March 2011, a net loss of $5.0 ($4.4 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share), respectively, was recognized related to this transaction. These amounts are reflected separately on the consolidated income statement within "Net loss on Airgas transaction" and include amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock and other acquisition-related costs. For the six months ended 31 March 2011 and 2010, cash payments for the acquisition-related costs were $153.8 and $2.4, respectively. These payments are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

Highlights
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 22, 2011)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income from continuing operations of $318 million, up 15 percent* versus prior year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.46, up 14 percent*, for its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2011.
These results exclude a $0.04 gain in discontinued operations recognizing a tax benefit from the sale of the company's U.S. healthcare operations in 2009. The discussion of third quarter results and guidance in this release excludes this item and is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Third quarter revenues of $2,578 million increased 14 percent from the prior year. On an underlying basis, sales were up seven percent on higher volumes primarily in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments. Operating income of $417 million rose 11 percent from the prior year on higher volumes.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We continued to see strong volume growth across a number of our businesses. Growth in the Asia Merchant business and more broadly in the energy and electronics markets was strong, while both the U.S. and Europe Merchant businesses were slower. This quarter, as expected, we saw a significant number of planned customer maintenance outages in our Tonnage segment. We remain very disappointed by the continued higher operating and maintenance costs in our Merchant segment and are taking the necessary steps to improve performance."
Third Quarter Segment Performance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, McGlade said, "We anticipate continued strong revenue growth in our Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. With the Tonnage planned maintenance outages behind us and the actions we are taking to improve Merchant performance, we expect margins to improve significantly in the quarter."
Air Products expects fourth quarter EPS to be between $1.48 and $1.53 per share and the full fiscal year EPS to be between $5.70 and $5.75 per share.
Last month, Air Products unveiled new financial targets for the 2015 timeframe. The company expects to deliver top line growth of 11 percent to 13 percent per year over the next four years, which would bring its total revenues to more than $15 billion in 2015. Air Products also expects to improve its operating margin to 20 percent and its return on capital to 15 percent by 2015.
Air Products (NYSE:APD) serves customers in industrial, energy, technology and healthcare markets worldwide with a unique portfolio of atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, and equipment and services. Founded in 1940, Air Products has built leading positions in key growth markets such as semiconductor materials, refinery hydrogen, home healthcare services, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives. The company is recognized for its innovative culture, operational excellence and commitment to safety and the environment. In fiscal 2010, Air Products had revenues of $9 billion, operations in over 40 countries, and 18,300 employees around the globe. For more information, visit .

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
A tax benefit of $8.9, or $.04 per share, has been recognized in income from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2011 as it relates to the previously divested healthcare business. This benefit resulted from the completion of an audit of tax years 2007 and 2008 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. For additional historical information on the U.S. Healthcare divestiture, refer to our 2010 Form 10-K.
AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, we commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash, less any required withholding tax. The offer was subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated 11 February 2010, as amended, including Airgas' redemption of the preferred stock purchase rights or such rights otherwise being inapplicable to our purchase of Airgas stock. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and hard goods. On 9 December 2010, we increased the value of our tender offer to $70.00 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would have been approximately $7.8 billion, including $6.1 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. Based on a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the decision of Airgas' board of directors to retain the preferred stock purchase rights, we withdrew our offer on 15 February 2011.
In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. On 3 February 2011, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for an amended $6.7 billion term loan credit facility with a maturity date of 4 June 2011. No additional underwriting fees were incurred in relation to the amended agreement. On 16 February 2011, in connection with the termination of the offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Airgas, the credit facility was terminated. No early termination penalties were incurred and all fees previously accrued and due under the credit facility were paid as of the date of termination.
Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share).
For the nine months ended 30 June 2011, a net loss of $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recognized related to this transaction. This amount is reflected separately on the consolidated income statement as "Net loss on Airgas transaction" and includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock, and other acquisition-related costs. For the nine months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010, cash payments for the acquisition-related costs were $156.2 and $8.8, respectively. These payments are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.

If, after the stockholder has delivered such
 
notice, any information required to be contained in such notice as described in clauses (1) through (10) above changes prior to the date of the relevant annual meeting, such notice shall be deemed to be not in compliance with this Section 1(b) and not effective unless such stockholder, within three New York Stock Exchange business days of the date of the event causing such change in information, delivers to the Secretary an updated notice containing such change. No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (10) of the second preceding sentence.
SECTION 2. . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the whole Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be designated in the notice thereof.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Exchange Act.

At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
SECTION 4. . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
List of Stockholders
 
meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation during normal business hours. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and be subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
SECTION 5. . The holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business unless and except that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, unless a different period is prescribed by applicable law.
Quorum; Adjournment
 
SECTION 6. . Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman; or, in the absence of the Chairman, by the Chief Executive Officer if separate from the Chairman; or, in the absence of both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, by the Presiding Director, if any; or, in the absence of the foregoing persons, by a chairman designated by the Board. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting; or, in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary shall so act; or, in their absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Organization
SECTION 7. . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
SECTION 8. . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or the holder of a proxy of such person, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock
Voting and Proxies
 
vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or as otherwise required by law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation, if a quorum exists at any meeting of stockholders, stockholders shall have approved any matter, other than the election of directors, if the votes cast by stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter in favor of such matter exceed the votes cast by such stockholders against such matter. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board only upon the vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present, except that a nominee for director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of the Corporation determines, as of the record date for such meeting, that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, a majority of the votes cast means that votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election.
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the
Inspectors of Election
 
meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
 
SECTION 1. .

Number; Nomination; Qualifications
Nominations of persons for election as directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination and who complies with the procedures for such nomination specified in this Section 2. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors may nominate a person or persons for election as directors only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination is given in accordance with the procedures for bringing business before an annual meeting set forth in Article I, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws. Each such notice of nomination by the stockholder must include, in addition to all of the information required under Article I, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws: (a) the name and address of the person or
 
persons to be nominated for election as directors by the stockholder; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between the stockholder, each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) related to the nomination of each nominee that are to be made by the stockholder; (d) all information that would be reasonably relevant to a determination by the Board as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder is "independent" within the meaning of all applicable securities law and stock exchange requirements; (e) all information that would be relevant to a determination by the Board (or any relevant committee) as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder meets any standards for Board membership set forth by the Board (or any committee thereof) in any publicly available documents; (f) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had such nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (g) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director if so elected. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders to elect directors may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person if not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s) without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (10) of Article 1, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws.

(a) This Section shall be applicable during any emergency condition as a result of which a quorum of the Board cannot readily be convened in accordance with the procedures prescribed therefore above. To the extent not in conflict with this Section, the remaining provisions of these Bylaws shall remain in effect during the emergency.
(b) In the event of such an emergency, a special meeting of the Board may be called by any officer or director by any means feasible at the time. In the event a quorum of the Board cannot be obtained for such a meeting, an emergency committee of the Board may be convened.

Each member of the emergency committee thus constituted who is not a director shall continue to act in such capacity until a director or an individual standing higher on the list is available to replace them. The emergency committee shall continue to act until a quorum of the Board is available and able to act. If, at the conclusion of the emergency, the Corporation has less than three directors able to act, the emergency committee shall cause a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors to be called and held as soon as practicable.
(d) The emergency committee shall have and may exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board, including the power to implement any emergency succession plan for the chief executive officer previously adopted by the Board, to fill a vacancy in any other office of the Corporation or to designate a temporary replacement for any officer of the Corporation who is unavailable, but shall not have the power to fill vacancies in the Board.

No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefore.
Compensation
SECTION 1. . Whenever notice is required to be given to any stockholder, director, officer, or agent, such requirement shall not be construed to mean personal notice.

Whenever notice is required to be given to any stockholder, such notice may in every instance be effectively given by regular or expedited United States mail, recognized courier service for overnight delivery, telegram, cable, telex, or telecopier, facsimile transmission, or by electronic mail or other electronic transmission (if such stockholder has consented to such form of electronic transmission) addressed to such stockholder at his or her address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation, including an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice. Notice shall be deemed given (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to the number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (a) such posting and (b) the giving of such separate notice, and (iv) all other instances, when such notice is dispatched.
Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by any of the methods in the foregoing paragraph. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number, or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known such address or number of such director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one (1) permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
 
SECTION 2. . A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder, director, officer, or agent, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such stockholder, director, officer, or agent. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

Interpretation, Amendment, and Survival of this Article
SECTION 2. . Subject to Section 4 of this
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
SECTION 3. . Subject to Section 4 of this Article V, the Corporation
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
shall indemnify any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity, and only to the extent of such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
SECTION 4. . Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or Section 3 of this Article V, as the case
Authorization of Indemnification
 
may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 5. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 2 and 3 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because such indemnitee has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V nor the absence
Indemnification by a Court
 
of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the indemnitee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Section 6. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article V to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue
 
or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
Section 7. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such actions, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) the statement or statements described in Section 8(a) from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be made without regard to whether a determination that indemnification is proper has been made in accordance with Section 4. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
Advance Payment of Expenses
 
Section 8.
Procedure
(a) To obtain an advance or final indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's advance or final indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for advancement pursuant to Section 7 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The rights to indemnification and advancement as granted by Section 2, 3, or 7 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 7 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as applicable, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's rights to indemnification and advancement, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Section 9. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or
 
an accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by the indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
(d) To indemnify or to advance expenses to any indemnitee with respect to service at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to the extent of any amount the indemnitee receives as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 
Full Year Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 21, 2011)  Air Products (NYSE: APD) today reported net income of $325 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51, for its fiscal 2011 fourth quarter versus $294 million* and $1.35*, respectively, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
The discussion of fourth quarter and full year results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,611 million increased 11 percent versus prior year and one percent sequentially. Underlying revenues were up six percent and two percent respectively. Operating income of $425 million rose six percent versus prior year and two percent sequentially on improved volumes.
For fiscal 2011, sales of $10,082 million increased 12 percent, primarily driven by a nine percent volume increase. Operating income of $1,671 million was up 13 percent and diluted EPS of $5.73 increased 14 percent from the prior year.
Commenting on the results, John McGlade, chairman, president and CEO said, "This quarter's improvements were driven by growth in emerging markets and strong performance in our Tonnage Gases business. Overall economic activity for this quarter continued at the slower underlying growth rate we saw last quarter."
 
Reflecting on the year, McGlade said, "We achieved another solid year of key project wins, double digit sales and earnings growth despite a slowing global economy in the second half of 2011. More importantly, we saw strong gains in operating cash flow and we improved our most important measure, return on capital, by 80 basis points to 13.3% for the year."
Fourth Quarter Segment Performance
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "While the near-term economic outlook is for continued slow growth and is clouded by global economic and policy uncertainties, we are well positioned with a large backlog of projects backed by signed customer contracts. We are confident that the prospects for industrial gases and Air Products, in particular, remain bright and we remain committed to achieving our 2015 goals for growth, margin and, most importantly, return on capital."
The company today announced initial guidance for fiscal year 2012 EPS in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per share, representing year-over-year earnings growth of three to ten percent. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012 ending December 31, 2011, EPS is expected to be between $1.31 and $1.39 per share.
The company also announced that it expects capital spending in fiscal 2012 to be between $1.9 and $2.2 billion.

NOTE: This release contains "forward-looking statements" within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including earnings guidance, projections and targets. These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, renewed deterioration in global economic and business conditions, including weakening demand for the Company's products and inability to maintain pricing; future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the success of commercial negotiations; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the Company's ability to recover energy and raw material costs from customers; the Company's ability to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; successful development and market acceptance of new products and applications, the ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in all regions of the world where the Company operates; the success of cost reduction and productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring activities; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company's foreign operations; the impact of environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized and other risk factors described in the Company's Form 10K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company's assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.
 
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is calculated as earnings after-tax divided by five-quarter average total capital. Earnings after-tax is defined as operating income and equity affiliates' income, after-tax at our quarterly effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and taxes have been adjusted for the impact of the net loss on Airgas transaction. Total capital consists of total debt and total equity.
 
 
 
Capital Expenditures
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as capital leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
A tax benefit of $8.9, or $.04 per share, has been recognized in income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended 30 September 2011 as it relates to the previously divested healthcare business. This benefit resulted from the completion of an audit of tax years 2007 and 2008 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. For additional historical information on the U.S. Healthcare divestiture, refer to our 2010 Form 10-K.
AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, we commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash, less any required withholding tax. The offer was subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated 11 February 2010, as amended, including Airgas' redemption of the preferred stock purchase rights or such rights otherwise being inapplicable to our purchase of Airgas stock. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and hard goods. On 9 December 2010, we increased the value of our tender offer to $70.00 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would have been approximately $7.8 billion, including $6.1 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. Based on a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the decision of Airgas' board of directors to retain the preferred stock purchase rights, we withdrew our offer on 15 February 2011.
In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. On 3 February 2011, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for an amended $6.7 billion term loan credit facility with a maturity date of 4 June 2011. No additional underwriting fees were incurred in relation to the amended agreement. On 16 February 2011, in connection with the termination of the offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Airgas, the credit facility was terminated. No early termination penalties were incurred and all fees previously accrued and due under the credit facility were paid as of the date of termination.
Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share).
For the twelve months ended 30 September 2011, a net loss of $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recognized related to this transaction. This amount is reflected separately on the consolidated income statement as "Net loss on Airgas transaction" and includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock, and other acquisition-related costs. For the twelve months ended 30 September 2011 and 2010, cash payments for the acquisition-related costs were $156.2 and $12.0, respectively. These payments are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

Quarter Summary
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 24, 2012)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $292 million*, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36*, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2011, versus $296 million* and $1.35* for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
The discussion of first quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
First quarter revenues of $2,423 million increased one percent versus the prior year on higher prices in Merchant Gases and Performance Materials. Higher volumes from new plants in Tonnage Gases were offset by lower Equipment sales and lower volumes in Performance Materials and Merchant Gases.
Sequentially, sales declined seven percent due to seasonality in Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant Gases, plus currency effects. Operating income of $385 million was down five percent and margin of 15.9% was down 100 basis points from last year driven by lower Equipment sales and weaker Merchant Gases volumes.
John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "As we expected, economic growth continued to slow this quarter, depressing volumes and limiting earnings growth. In spite of these economic headwinds, we did improve our operating performance, while lowering costs and winning significant new tonnage contracts."
First Quarter Segment Performance
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "We expect second quarter economic activity to remain slow. We are forecasting Asia and North America growth to accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year. Coupled with our improved operating performance and new plant on-streams, this should lead to stronger sales and earnings growth in the last half of our year. Our recent orders, strong project backlog and robust bidding activity position us well to achieve our 2015 goals for growth, margin and returns."
Air Products is maintaining its guidance for fiscal 2012 of $5.90 to $6.30 per share. The company expects second quarter EPS to be between $1.37 and $1.43 per share.
Annual Meeting of Shareholders
Air Products will host its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, January 26, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. ET. Access the audio Webcast at:

1. INCOME TAXES
We have been challenged by the Spanish tax authorities predominantly over income tax deductions taken by certain of our Spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005-2011. Although we continue to believe that all positions taken were compliant with applicable laws, in November 2011 we reached a settlement with the Spanish tax authorities for 41.3 million (approximately $56) in resolution of all tax issues under examination. Of this settlement, $43.8 ($.20 per share) increased our income tax expense and had an 11.2% impact in our effective tax rate for the three months ended 31 December 2011. The cash payment for the settlement was principally paid in January 2012.
2. SUBSEQUENT EVENT  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Homecare
In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business.
On 8 January 2012, we reached agreements for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain. This business represents approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues.
The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and employee consultation requirements and are expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Total sale proceeds of 590 million (approximately $767) will be received in cash at closing. This amount includes contingent proceeds of 110 million (approximately $143) related to future business activity in Spain and Portugal. The gain related to the contingent proceeds will be deferred until the contingency period ends and the final proceeds are realized per the terms of the agreement. We will also be entitled to receive additional cash proceeds based on a percentage of the collection of the accounts receivable recorded between 30 September 2011 and the sale closing date.
We expect to sell the remaining portion of our Homecare business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom, within the next year.
The Homecare business is currently reported in the Merchant Gases segment and will be accounted for as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

On 15 March 2012, the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") amended the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws to eliminate the exclusive forum provision in Article VIII, Section 7. This provision mandated that the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware be the exclusive forum for derivative claims brought on behalf of the Company, breach of fiduciary duty claims involving the officers, directors, or employees of the Company, and any other action involving the Company asserting a claim arising under the Delaware General Corporation law or governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company's Bylaws, as amended, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that stockholder meetings shall not be held at any place, but may instead by held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, to the extent authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, by

For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given written notice thereof, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, not more than 120 days or less than 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days before or more than 60 calendar days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th calendar day prior to such annual meeting or the 10
th

In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement of such adjournment or postponement commence a new time period (or change the existing time period) for
 
the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Any such notice by the stockholder shall include (1) a brief description of each item of business proposed to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment; (2) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business; (3) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; (4) the name of each person with whom such stockholder has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except pursuant to a revocable proxy given to such person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made generally by such person to all holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation) or disposing of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, or to cooperate in obtaining, changing or influencing the control of the Corporation (except independent financial, legal and other advisors acting in the ordinary course of their respective businesses), and a description of each such agreement, arrangement or understanding; (5) a description of the material interest of the stockholder, each affiliate (as defined under Regulation 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of such stockholder, each person described under clause (4) above and each person (if any) nominated by such stockholder in accordance with Article II, Section 2 of these Bylaws for election as a director to the
 
Board (each person described in this clause (5), a "Covered Person") in each item of business described pursuant to clause (1) above; (6) a list of the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are owned of record or beneficially by each Covered Person and documentary evidence of such record or beneficial ownership; (7) a list of all derivative securities (as defined under Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) and other derivatives or similar arrangements to which any Covered Person is a counterparty and which relate to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, a description of all economic terms of each such derivative securities and other derivatives or similar arrangements, and copies of all agreements and other documents relating to each such derivative securities and other derivatives or similar arrangements; (8) a list of all transactions by any Covered Person involving any shares of capital stock of the Corporation or any derivative securities (as defined under Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) or other derivatives or similar arrangements related to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation occurring within 60 days of the date of the notice; (9) all other information that, as of the date of the notice, would be required to be filed on Schedule 13D (including the exhibits thereto) under the Exchange Act by any Covered Person, regardless of whether such Covered Person has publicly filed or is required to file a Schedule 13D containing such information; and (10) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of any of such stockholder's proposals, a representation to that effect. If, after the stockholder has delivered such notice, any information required to be contained in such notice as described in
 
clauses (1) through (10) above changes prior to the date of the relevant annual meeting, such notice shall be deemed to be not in compliance with this Section 1(b) and not effective unless such stockholder, within three New York Stock Exchange business days of the date of the event causing such change in information, delivers to the Secretary an updated notice containing such change. No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (10) of the second preceding sentence.
SECTION 2. . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the whole Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be designated in the notice thereof.
Special Meetings
SECTION 3. . Each stockholder of record shall be given written notice of each meeting of stockholders, which notice shall state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
Notice of Meetings
 
for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Exchange Act.
When a meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
SECTION 4. . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place
List of Stockholders
 
of business of the Corporation during normal business hours. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and be subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
SECTION 5. . The holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business unless and except that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, unless a different period is prescribed by applicable law.
Quorum; Adjournment
 
SECTION 6. . Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman; or, in the absence of the Chairman, by the Chief Executive Officer if separate from the Chairman; or, in the absence of both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, by the Presiding Director, if any; or, in the absence of the foregoing persons, by a chairman designated by the Board. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting; or, in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary shall so act; or, in their absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Organization
SECTION 7. . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
SECTION 8. . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or the holder of a proxy of such person, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Voting and Proxies
 
Unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or as otherwise required by law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation, if a quorum exists at any meeting of stockholders, stockholders shall have approved any matter, other than the election of directors, if the votes cast by stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter in favor of such matter exceed the votes cast by such stockholders against such matter. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board only upon the vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present, except that a nominee for director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of the Corporation determines, as of the record date for such meeting, that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, a majority of the votes cast means that votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election.
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The
Inspectors of Election
 
Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
 
SECTION 1. . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
General Powers
SECTION 2. . The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed from time to time by a vote of the majority of the whole Board. (The term "whole Board" as used in these Bylaws shall mean the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies or unfilled previously authorized directorships.)
Number; Nomination; Qualifications
Nominations of persons for election as directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination and who complies with the procedures for such nomination specified in this Section 2. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors may nominate a person or persons for election as directors only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination is given in accordance with the procedures for bringing business before an annual meeting set forth in Article I, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws. Each such notice of nomination by the stockholder must include, in addition to all of the information required under Article I, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws: (a) the name and address of the person or
 
persons to be nominated for election as directors by the stockholder; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between the stockholder, each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) related to the nomination of each nominee that are to be made by the stockholder; (d) all information that would be reasonably relevant to a determination by the Board as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder is "independent" within the meaning of all applicable securities law and stock exchange requirements; (e) all information that would be relevant to a determination by the Board (or any relevant committee) as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder meets any standards for Board membership set forth by the Board (or any committee thereof) in any publicly available documents; (f) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had such nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (g) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director if so elected. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders to elect directors may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person if not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s) without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (10) of Article 1, Section 1(b) of these Bylaws.
 
SECTION 3. . Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his resignation to the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or, if the time when it is to become effective shall not be specified therein, then it shall take effect when received.

Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by one-third of the directors then in office, or by the Presiding Director, if any; and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as they or he shall fix. Notice of the place, date, and time of each such special meeting shall be given each director by whom it is not waived by providing written notice not less than four hours before the scheduled time of such meeting. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting.
Special Meetings
 
SECTION 7. . Members of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Bylaw shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

SECTION 8. . At all meetings of the Board one-third (1/3) of the total number of the whole Board, but not less than two (2), shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise provided herein or be required by law.

Emergency Bylaws
(a) This Section shall be applicable during any emergency condition as a result of which a quorum of the Board cannot readily be convened in accordance with the procedures prescribed therefore above. To the extent not in conflict with this Section, the remaining provisions of these Bylaws shall remain in effect during the emergency.
(b) In the event of such an emergency, a special meeting of the Board may be called by any officer or director by any means feasible at the time. In the event a quorum of the Board cannot be obtained for such a meeting, an emergency committee of the Board may be convened.
 
(c) An emergency committee of the Board shall consist of any members of the Board who are available and able to act and, in the event less than three members of the Board are available and able to act, one or more persons standing highest on the following list who are available and able to act, but not to exceed the number of persons needed to comprise an emergency committee of three:
 
 
 
 
 
Each member of the emergency committee thus constituted who is not a director shall continue to act in such capacity until a director or an individual standing higher on the list is available to replace them. The emergency committee shall continue to act until a quorum of the Board is available and able to act. If, at the conclusion of the emergency, the Corporation has less than three directors able to act, the emergency committee shall cause a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors to be called and held as soon as practicable.
(d) The emergency committee shall have and may exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board, including the power to implement any emergency succession plan for the chief executive officer previously adopted by the Board, to fill a vacancy in any other office of the Corporation or to designate a temporary replacement for any officer of the Corporation who is unavailable, but shall not have the power to fill vacancies in the Board.

SECTION 15. . The directors may be reimbursed for their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board, of special and standing committees thereof and in connection with other business of the Corporation, and may be paid for their services as directors and as members of such committees as may be determined by resolutions adopted by the Board from time to time. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefore.
Compensation
SECTION 1. . Whenever notice is required to be given to any stockholder, director, officer, or agent, such requirement shall not be construed to mean personal notice.

SECTION 2. . A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder, director, officer, or agent, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such stockholder, director, officer, or agent.

Interpretation, Amendment, and Survival of this Article
SECTION 2. . Subject to Section 4 of this
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
SECTION 3. . Subject to Section 4 of this Article V, the Corporation
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
shall indemnify any indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity, and only to the extent of such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
SECTION 4. . Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or Section 3 of this Article V, as the case
Authorization of Indemnification
 
may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 5. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 2 and 3 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because such indemnitee has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4 of this Article V nor the absence
Indemnification by a Court
 
of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the indemnitee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Section 6. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article V to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue
 
or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
Section 7. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such actions, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) the statement or statements described in Section 8(a) from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be made without regard to whether a determination that indemnification is proper has been made in accordance with Section 4. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
Advance Payment of Expenses
 
Section 8.
Procedure
(a) To obtain an advance or final indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's advance or final indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for advancement pursuant to Section 7 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The rights to indemnification and advancement as granted by Section 2, 3, or 7 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 7 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, as applicable, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's rights to indemnification and advancement, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Section 9. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or

Where a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case an officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate has been issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or whose facsimile

Second Quarter Summary
 
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 24, 2012)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $281 million* and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.31* on a non-GAAP, continuing operations basis, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2012. This excludes: a $0.28 per share charge for cost reduction actions, mostly in Europe; a $0.27 per share tax benefit resulting from a non-cash Spanish tax ruling; and $0.08 per share of earnings from the Homecare Business, which has been reclassified to discontinued operations.
The discussion of second quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP continuing operations comparisons that exclude these items. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Second quarter revenues of $2,344 million decreased two percent versus prior year, primarily on lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar. Underlying sales were up two percent on higher Tonnage Gases volumes and improved pricing in Merchant Gases. Operating income of $375 million was down six percent and operating margin of 16% decreased 60 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to volume mix between the businesses.
Sequentially, sales increased one percent, with underlying sales up 3%, primarily due to increased volumes in Performance Materials and Equipment. Operating income was up six percent and operating margin increased 80 basis points, mainly due to higher Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases volumes.
Commenting on the quarter, John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, second quarter volumes were below our expectations, as business activity did not pick up as much as we expected. With Europe in recession, we have taken actions to improve our business portfolio and cost positions. While our volumes were held down by lower demand, we did see positive impact from our pricing efforts and new plants."
Second Quarter Segment Performance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "We are entering the second half of the year at lower levels of business activity than originally anticipated, reducing growth in both sales and earnings for fiscal 2012. We still expect both to pick up during the second half of 2012 and into 2013. Our capital spending for this year is anticipated to come in at the high end of our range at approximately $2.2 billion. We expect to sign a record amount of new business this year and to continue to deliver gains in productivity that will contribute to strong, profitable growth."
Air Products expects third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.40 and $1.45 per share. The company's adjusted guidance for continuing operations for fiscal 2012 is $5.47 to $5.60 per share. This includes a $0.30 per share reduction for the movement of Homecare to discontinued operations.

Capital Expenditures
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as capital leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment.
On 8 January 2012, we reached agreements for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain. This business represents approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues. We expect to sell the remaining portion of Homecare, which is primarily in the United Kingdom, within the next year.
The transaction with Linde received regulatory approval on 18 April 2012 and is expected to close on 30 April 2012. Total sale proceeds of 590 million (approximately $785) will be received in cash at closing. This amount includes contingent proceeds of 110 million (approximately $146) related to future business activity in Spain and Portugal. The gain related to the contingent proceeds will be deferred until the contingency period ends and the final proceeds are realized per the terms of the agreement. We will also be entitled to receive up to 32 million (approximately $43) of additional cash proceeds based upon collection of accounts receivable. We anticipate an after-tax gain in the range of 105-130 million (approximately $140-$170) on the sale of this business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
The Homecare business is being accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
2. COST REDUCTION PLAN
During the second quarter ended 31 March 2012, we initiated a cost reduction plan. The results from continuing operations includes a charge of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for this plan. This charge represents the ongoing actions we are taking to improve our cost structure, particularly in Europe. It includes removing the stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business and the actions we are taking to right-size our European business cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook.
This charge includes $80.8 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions from our workforce. The remainder of the charge, $6.0, is related to the write-down of certain assets. The planned actions are expected to be completed within the next twelve months. The charge for the cost reduction plan is excluded from segment operating profit. The charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials.
3. INCOME TAXES
Q1 Spanish Tax Settlement
We were challenged by the Spanish tax authorities over income tax deductions taken by certain of our Spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005-2011. Although we continue to believe that all positions taken were compliant with applicable laws, in November 2011 we reached a settlement with the Spanish tax authorities for 41.3 million (approximately $56) in resolution of all tax issues under examination. Of this settlement, $43.8 ($.20 per share) increased our income tax expense and had a 6.7% impact in our effective tax rate for the six months ended 31 March 2012. The cash payment for the settlement was principally paid in January 2012.
Q2 Spanish Tax Ruling
As of 30 September 2011, our unrecognized tax benefits included an amount related to certain transactions of a Spanish subsidiary for years 1991 and 1992, a period before we controlled this subsidiary. In March 2009, the Spanish appeals court (Audiencia Nacional) ruled in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. The Spanish government appealed this court decision to the Spanish Supreme Court, and as a result, we did not reverse the liability accrued for these unrecognized tax benefits. On 25 January 2012, the Spanish Supreme Court released its decision affirming the decision of the Audiencia Nacional in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. As a result, in the second quarter we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $58.3 ($.27 per share), including interest and penalties, and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. This reduction in income tax expense had a 19.8% and 8.9% impact on our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended 31 March 2012, respectively.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

 -         Change the focus and design to reflect a more global perspective than the current version which is more U.S. centric.
 -         Provide updated messages from the Company's Chairman and Chief Risk Officer.
 -         Strengthen the language on employees' obligations to report and the Company's policy on non-retaliation for employees that do report in good faith.
 -         Include a focus on Sustainability in the Environmental, Health, and Safety section.
 -         Emphasize employee safety and employee responsibility for security in the Environmental, Health and Safety section.

 -         Include guidance for external networking sites and add a new section on social media use.
 -         Strengthen the global anti-bribery section to reflect the broadened definitions and responsibilities under the new U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and reference the requirement for compliance under all international legislation.
 -         Remove the specific section on healthcare law compliance, due to the Company's divestiture of its European homecare business and intention to divest its entire homecare business.
The above summary of changes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Code of Conduct which is filed as Exhibit 14 to this current report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

For simplicity of language, the Code of Conduct addresses "employees" or "employee" or refers to the collective workforce as "we" or addresses employees as "you." Groups other than "regular employees" may sometimes be asked, before or during their relationship with Air Products, to read/and or comply with some or all of the Code of Conduct and related policies, standards, guidelines, and processes. Completion of this step by non-regular employee groups, if requested during the course of the business relationship, does not imply employee status, employment, or any employer obligation by Air Products. The term "Air Products" will be used throughout the Code to refer to Air Products and its companies.

Exhibit 14
Letter from John McGlade on Integrity
Air Products has, since its founding, succeeded because of our people. Our people listen, understand and respond to the needs of customers. Our employees' unwavering focus on safety and sustainability maintains our outstanding industry performance. Our shareholders know we will work hard to meet our financial goals. And there's another quality we possess that is a deeply held value and an integral part of our brand. It's integrity.
Upholding our integrity reinforces the trust and respect we've worked so hard to earn in our relationships. Preserved, it strengthens us in powerful ways. If integrity is lost, a priceless asset is not only gone but also very difficultif not impossible to earn back.
As a global company, we meet or exceed the laws in the countries where we operate. We must also at all times follow Air Products' policies, practices, standards, and guidelines. We all have an obligation to preserve Air Products' commitment to ethical business and integrous behavior at all times. It's the right way and the only way we will do business. Consider what's right as you do your daily work, and if a situation is unclear to you, ask for help before you act!
We've highlighted the basics in our Code of Conduct. Read it carefully and consider how the information applies to you. Familiarize yourself with the resources to report violations. Follow your instinct if it tells you to ask questions or express concerns. These are responsibilities we are each accountable to build into our daily work.
You also have rights. It's your right to make a report or ask questions without fear, retaliation, or retribution. Air Products makes a firm promise of non-retaliation.
Winning in the marketplace is our goal. That can be hard work in today's business world. No challenge justifies giving away your integrity. It's a treasure beyond price. We must all fiercely protect it as we work together to achieve our vision.
John E. McGlade
Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 14
Overview
It's essential that we keep the highest standards of integrity during all our business interactions. That means complying with the laws as well as Air Products' policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures in every country where we operate. It also means being fair and honestdoing the "right" thing. But what's "right" isn't always immediately clear.
Company Expectations
This Employee Code of Conduct describes Air Products' expectations for ethical behavior by employees of Air Products. Company policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures provide more detail about how we should act as members of the Air Products workforce. You should review the Code of Conduct and all related documents that apply to your position and role and ask questions of your manager or supervisor whenever the information is not clear.
If you encounter a situation where what's "right" isn't obviouseither for you or for those with whom you're collaboratingyou should seek guidance. There are resources, described here, to help you get more information. Ask questions, express concerns, or report suspected Code violations for follow-up by your manager or supervisor and our ethics and compliance subject matter experts and contacts. As employees, we're all responsible for ethical behavior. We're also expected to report violations or suspected violations. Air Products promises that those who, in good faith, report violations or suspected violations of the Code of Conduct will never be retaliated against in any way. We must each do our part to support the Company's commitment to ethical business.
Requirements
As a company, we must uphold our integrity and safeguard our reputation for transacting business in a honest manner. Since Air Products is a multinational company, employees will encounter many different laws, regulations, policies, and formal or informal business practices. Compliance with all laws and Air Products' policies, standards, guidelines and procedures in all geographies where we do business is necessary. Where you're unsure of legal requirements or Company policies, or if they seem to conflict, you should consult with your manager or supervisor or the Law Group or Chief Risk Office for guidance.
Employees who don't comply with the Code of Conduct may be subject to termination of employment and/or criminal prosecution and legal action by the Company in some cases. As allowed by local law, managers and supervisors may be subject to disciplinary action and/or personal liability for failure to address violations committed by employees. This means that managers and supervisors should report misconduct by employees under their management. Not being familiar with the Code of Conduct or policies, standards, guidelines and procedures for your role does not excuse a violation; we are all responsible for understanding this important information.
If you are in a role that requires you to interact with joint ventures, agents, distributors, or service providers, you may be aware of the requirements of their Codes of Conduct. We must also follow Air Products' Code of Conduct, policies, practices and guidelines, especially if these are more stringent.

Exhibit 14
Reporting
Air Products expects employees to report misconduct or ethics violations. There are several tools and resources to help you. If you have questions or doubts, or you need to report a Code violation, first talk to your supervisor or manager. If you are not comfortable speaking to your manager, or if you've done so and are not satisfied with his or her response, you can seek help from any of the contacts listed on the Company's website: www.airproducts.com/codeofconduct.
At any time, you can also seek guidance or assistance from the Law Group, Chief Risk Officer, Corporate Audit, or any of the Company's executives. And if you prefer to speak to someone outside of Air Products, you can call the IntegrityLine at 1-877-272-9726 or visit www.airproducts.com/integrityline for local reporting numbers and instructions.
The phone lines and website are operated by a third-party vendor Air Products has engaged to assist with ethics and compliance reporting. Further instructions for their use are available in the Code of Conduct insert on reporting. The categories and process allowable for reporting vary by country/ region. Please familiarize yourself with your local law when using the third- party reporting tools. Remember, Air Products enforces a strict promise of non-retaliation.
A Note from George Bitto, Chief Risk Officer, on Behaving with Integrity
As employees, it's our duty to reinforce Air Products' high standards of integrity and ethical behavior. Air Products employees value honesty and fairness. In surveys, discussion forums and through anecdotal feedback, colleagues have repeatedly emphasized the importance of professional ethics. Our actions speak louder still. We've built a strong reputation for integrity. It's an expectation of the Company that we all work to preserve it.
We do that by understanding the Code of Conduct and all related policies, standards and guidelines, by taking all training required for our role or position, by reporting violations or suspicions, and, most importantly, by keeping integrity at the forefront of our daily work. We're fortunate to work for a company where a commitment to integrity is a core corporate value and personally important to our employees as well.
George Bitto Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Risk Officer
But even in a culture where integrity is key to our brand, situations arise where the right path is not always obvious. There are resources to help, including your supervisor, manager or any other leader in the company. When that's not possible or practical, employees can utilize the IntegrityLine phone and Web submission process administered by our third-party vendor or refer to our internal contact list of subject matter experts.
It's the responsibility of each employee to comply with the Code of Conduct. Managers and supervisors have an additional obligation to create and maintain a work environment that encourages and promotes openness and honesty. Employees should feel comfortable using any of the resources outlined in the Code of Conduct to seek assistance during compromising situations. Leadership means offering full support to those who help uphold our integrity, including keeping our promise of non-retaliation.
We view integrity as essential to our ongoing success. Employees in any geography, in any role, should not hesitate to approach an Air Products leader on this topic.

Exhibit 14
Company Compliance
How to File a Report
Employees who have questions or concerns, need advice, or suspect that a Code violation may have occurred should first speak to their immediate supervisor or manager. However, if the situation or questions involve the supervisor or manager, or when an employee prefers to speak to someone else, he or she should take the matter to the Law Group, the Chief Risk Officer, Corporate Audit, or any company executive.
As employees, in some circumstances we may sometimes feel reluctant or uncomfortable reporting violations or concerns to others within Air Products. Anyone inside or outside the company can make a report, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, using one of several tools available with external, third-party companies contracted by Air Products. Using our IntegrityLine, callers can speak (often in local language) to vendor representatives who can document concerns and route for follow-up. The IntegrityOnline website is available in numerous languages from any Internet connection. The employees of the third-party vendor are trained to accurately document information you provide. That enables Air Products to investigate all concerns.
Those making reports can choose to remain anonymous (where permitted by local law), but you are encouraged to identify yourself to make follow-up more effective. Withholding your name or detailed information can make it difficult for Air Products to address or resolve issues and concerns. Whether you choose to discuss your concerns by phone or online, you'll receive a report number to use if you want to follow up. Then the third-party company will forward the report to the appropriate people at Air Products for investigation.
Please note that Data Privacy laws in some countries limit the type/category of report employees can make using the IntegrityLine phone numbers or IntegrityOnline Web page. In some countries, reports can be made only for audit, accounting, fraud and financial irregularities using these tools. Similarly, anonymous reporting is prohibited by law in some countries. In this case, the reporting system will advise you how to proceed.
Here are your options: www.airproducts.com/integrityline

Exhibit 14
Reporting Accounting Irregularities
Those who want to report suspected violations related to questionable accounting or auditing matters directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors may do so. Employees can ask that a report made online or by phone be forwarded to the Audit Committee, or the complaint may be mailed directly to the Audit Committee in care of the Corporate Secretary's Office at Air Products in Allentown, Pennsylvania (see address information on back cover).
Code of Conduct Certification Requirements
Periodically, the Chief Risk Officer, Corporate Risk Office, or Audit Department may designate certain employees who will be required to provide a written certification that they have reviewed and understand the Code of Conduct, or portions of it, or related policies, standards, and guidelines. The certification will confirm that, during the immediately preceding period, the employee complied with the Code of Conduct and that he or she has no personal knowledge of any violation of it by others.
Fairness and Non-retaliation
Fair Dealing
We should all deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers, competitors, and our colleagues. No one should take advantage of people or situations through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice.

Protecting Those Who Help
Protect the Company
Our reputation for honesty is a valuable asset. That's why we promise non- retaliation for employees who protect it. You should report actual or suspected Code of Conduct or ethics and compliance and governance policy violations. If you feel you are the victim of retaliation because you adhered to the Code of Conduct, questioned unethical business practices, or reported a violation, use one of the reporting tools or resources to report the retaliation immediately. Air Products will not tolerate retaliation against those who uphold the Company's commitment to integrity.

Exhibit 14
Work Environment
and Employment
Diversity and Inclusion
Air Products is sincere in its commitment to build an inclusive working environment where openness, trust, and respect are integral parts of our global corporate culture. As employees, we must treat each other with respect and value each other's differences. The perspectives those differences bring are important to our ongoing success.
The Company considers harassment and discrimination to be unjust and damaging to our work environment. In most countries, harassment and discrimination are illegal. Air Products strives to meet or exceed existing laws in all countries where we operate.
Employees should consult all relevant regional policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures related to work environment and respect in the workplace. They should also keep up-to-date on the Company's training on Diversity and Inclusion, anti- harassment, and other courses about our work environment.
Air Products will not tolerate violence or threats of violence in the workplace. Employees who bring weapons or hazardous materials to work or who act in a manner that frightens or intimidates other employees will be disciplined.
Q My colleague has an e-mail distribution list to which she forwards jokes that sometimes poke fun at gender, race, religion, politics and other personal differences. I find some of them offensive and worry that others do too. What should I do?
A Humor is very much a matter of personal taste, and people sometimes share jokes that are not appropriate for the workplace.
Your colleague may not realize that the subject matter of some of the jokes she forwards might insult or demean members of the distribution. You should talk to her and explain your feelings. If she reacts negatively to your request, you should speak with your
supervisor. Jokes, graphics, verbal comments, gestures, and other communications that embarrass or degrade people damage our working environment. You have every right to speak up.

Exhibit 14
Equal Opportunity
Employment
Air Products' employees are its most valuable assets. Our continued success depends on attracting and keeping a diverse workforce of talented men and women. Every employee will be judged on the basis of his or her qualifications and skills, without regard to personal characteristics. The Company fully supports all principles of equal opportunity in employment and will follow all such laws in the countries where we operate.
Human Rights and Labor and Employment Laws
For creativity and innovation to flourish, people need an inclusive environment where their rights and points of view
are welcome and respected and they are treated with decency and dignity. Air Products is committed to fostering this environment. We follow all labor and employment laws in the countries where we operate, including laws pertaining to child labor and employee rights, such as freedom of association, privacy, and equal opportunity employment.
A I'm the hiring manager for a position that involves international work. The best qualified person I've interviewed is a woman, but I know that some businessmen in some of these countries do not like dealing with women. Her skills are the best match, but her gender might affect our business. What should I do?
It is against the policy of Air Products, and illegal, to exclude a job candidate because of gender. It is important that we follow the right path in what we do, regardless of location. Our integrity should never be compromised, even if the right choice might affect profit.

Sustainability, Environment,
Health, Safety, and Security
Ensuring Sustainability
For Air Products, sustainability encompasses many activities that are important to the Company and its stakeholders. We strive to create lasting value through environmental stewardship, social and corporate responsibility, and innovative solutions for energy, environmental and emerging market needs. We strive to be good neighbors and fair employers in the communities where we operate. We are responsible environmental stewards and corporate citizens. Each of us should try to maintain the values of sustainable business during our daily work.
Like most large companies, Air Products uses water, energy and other resources and has an environmental footprint. That's why we've established goals to conserve resources and reduce emissions and have policies to support those goals. Our water and energy consumption goals and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets are monitored by the Air Products Sustainability Council, and we're working to continuously improve our performance. It's every employee's responsibility to advance the company towards those goals by using resources wisely, following appropriate practices for reducing waste, and recycling or reusing materials when possible.
Sustainability includes good governance. This Code of Conduct document, related policies, standards, guidelines, and any training required for your role reinforce our commitments for behaving with integrity in all our business transactions. If you become aware of any sustainability-related ethics and compliance issue, you should discuss your concerns immediately, using one of the contacts or tools provided here.
Acting Responsibly to Preserve and Protect the Environment
Air Products is committed to preserving the environment. The Company's policies meet or exceed government environmental protection laws in the countries where we operate. We're proud to be a Responsible Care company and a member of several organizations that aim to minimize environmental impact from the manufacture, distribution, and use of chemicals. It's our practice to meet those environmental guidelines in all instances. Employees must always follow all Air Products Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability policies, standards, and procedures and take all required training.

Exhibit 14
Keeping Our Workplace, Employees and Communities Safe
Air Products has made it a priority to operate with safe and healthy working conditions, and that takes commitment as well as constant safety focus by each of us. Our safety record is commendable, and we are committed to continuous improvement in safety performance.
All employees are responsible for working safely and reporting unsafe conditions. We should follow all safety-related policies, standards, processes and guidelines to preserve and protect our own safety and that of our colleagues. We also have some local and regional programs, information, and tools to enhance employee health and wellness as well as policies to ensure that we all go home from work as safe as we arrived. These may vary by region, and might include policies and standards related to tobacco use, badge systems for entry to sites, local and regional health benefits, corporate wellness programs and more. Your manager or supervisor, EH&S and Human Resources can help you understand any that apply to your site or role.
Employee violations of safety policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures, at work or at customer sites, can result in disciplinary action. Violence, or threats of violence, and possession of weapons in the workplace won't be tolerated. Likewise, substance abuse on the job compromises everyone's safety and is prohibited.
Securing Our Sites and Products
Protecting each other, our neighboring communities, and our company property is a matter we take seriously. Because we manufacture and transport products that could cause harm if used by people with malicious intent, security is a priority for Air Products. We have taken stringent measures to ensure the safety and security of our operations and products. We are all required to follow all security policies, standards, and procedures at our sites, without exception. As employees, it's also our responsibility to ensure visitors and guests are aware of our safety and security procedures and act in compliance with them.
Employees should alert Global Corporate Security (the Global Asset Protection Group) when they have security concerns or suspicions of any sort. In the past, potentially dangerous situations have been averted because vigilant employees took the proper security precautions or alerted Global Corporate Security about issues.
Did you know?
Q I noticed that people often hold the door open to allow those behind them in the queue at our entrance to come along in without swiping their badge. I figure it's probably OK because we're all employees, but sometimes I do see people I don't recognize. What should I do?
A You should never allow others entry to our buildings without following the proper security procedures, which require each individual to swipe their badge at most sites. You are not being rude to deny access; you're helping protect our people, plants and confidential information. If someone questions your action, explain that it's a matter of Company policy that everyone entering our buildings use their own authorized badge. Likewise, we should all follow policies and procedures related to guests and visitors for our sites.

Exhibit 14
Managing Company
Assets and Information
Did you know?
Information Security Risks: One
of the biggest threats to important Company information (and your own private information) can be avoided by simple behavior changes. Those with malicious intent constantly invent more sophisticated ways to trick people into divulging information or giving them an "in" for hidden computer programs to access systems, databases, and other information repositories. These criminals pose as legitimate businesses or contacts or publish e-mails or websites that appear to be genuine. You should treat every e-mail, Internet link, attachment or information request (electronic, live, or by phone) with caution. Never share your network or personal passwords, provide sensitive information online or in e-mail, or click on links in unverified e-mails. Always double-check to confirm the true identity of those requesting information.
Appropriate Use of Company Systems, Information and Equipment
It's everyone's responsibility to protect Company assets. Theft and carelessness impact our profits. We should not only follow policy ourselves but also help to protect our propertyincluding information assetsby immediately reporting any suspected fraud, theft, security breach, or improper use of Company assets by others.
Company equipment, systems, information, goods, and services should be used only for Company business. Incidental personal use is permissible in some cases, provided it does not affect business transactions or productivity. Using Air Products' assets or information for personal gain is prohibited.
If you misplace or lose any device with company data stored on it, you should report that loss to Corporate Security (Global Asset Protection).
Managing Records and Documents
Company records are important corporate assets. Effective and efficient record keeping helps our work processes operate smoothly. Proper records management is driven by legal, regulatory and operational requirements. Records and other important company information must be properly managed (created, used, shared, stored, and destroyed) throughout their life cycle.
All employees are responsible for understanding how to classify the information they handle and manage it according to company policies as well as laws and regulations. You should consult your supervisor or department Information Lead for guidance if you are uncertain how to manage your records or documents.
 
Exhibit 14
Insider Trading
It is a violation of Air Products' policy for an employee to disclose, directly or indirectly, any nonpublic information he or she becomes aware of in the course of employment with the Company. We are not allowed to use such information to our own advantage or to Air Products' disadvantage. For example, employees may not purchase stock in another company that we have reason to believe Air Products may be interested in acquiring. The policy is consistent with U.S. laws on insider trading and also aims to prevent damage to the Company from the disclosure of valuable information.
Insider Tradingbuying or selling Air Products stock while you know material information about the company that the public doesn't knowis unfair. It's also a crime. "Material" information includes anything likely to influence a potential investor's decision to buy or sell Air Products stock. Significant things like potential acquisitions or divestitures, corporate earnings projections, and planned changes in senior management can all be considered material information.
Insider trading laws prohibit less obvious things, too. If you know nonpublic material information, you may not trade Air Products stock either directly or within your retirement and savings plan. If you can't make a trade, neither can your family members, nor anyone living in your household. Also, you are prohibited from telling others material information that is not public. Similarly, you may not buy or sell the stock of our customers, suppliers, or other business partners if you have material nonpublic information about them.
It's about basic fairness. Investors should be able to trust that everyone trading in the market has the same information. Insider trading distorts the market and damages trust.

Exhibit 14
Intellectual Property and Protecting
Company Information Assets
We are all responsible for helping to protect Air Products' intellectual assets. Intellectual assets (or intellectual property) include the knowledge, information, and know-how that a company and its employees possess that can be converted to value. Written plans, product designs, current and future projects, patents, trademarks, know-how and work processes, and other valuable information are examples of intellectual assets owned by Air Products. The free flow of information at Air Products is critical to our performance. However, details of our intellectual assets could be valuable to a competitor or other outside parties. Air Products has a comprehensive Information Risk Management program, which includes tools and techniques for protecting intellectual assets, so employees can make the most of our combined intellectual resources. But it takes vigilance by everyone to safeguard them. There are also policies, standards, and guidelines to help us maintain the security of our intellectual assets.
Air Products' employees may hold or desire to receive confidential information owned by other companies or individuals, which the Company is legally obligated to protect. If you wish to receive or make use of such confidential or proprietary information, you must first take certain steps. You must have a signed nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement, approved by the appropriate business leader, and you must abide by its terms. Following this step can help avoid potential legal claims or issues that might compromise the Company's own research efforts, developments, and business. If you have questions or are uncertain what process to follow, consult your manager or supervisor or the Law Group.
Employees should protect all sensitive and confidential information about Air Products or other companies or individuals from unauthorized disclosure or use. This includes following policies to protect information you personally possess as well as that housed or exchanged on any Air Products system, database or application. Using such information for personal gain or to the disadvantage of the Company is also against Air Products' policies. In addition, care must be taken when storing, sharing or disposing of sensitive and confidential information, whether electronic or hard copy.
Q I receive some external web site advertising and promotions on my work e-mail account and subscribe to some non-work related news. Is that allowed by Company policy?
A Air Products hardware, software, and systems should be used primarily for business purposes. However, it's fine to enjoy some limited personal use as long as it doesn't impact system security, efficiency, or reliability or the productivity of you or your colleagues. However, such use can pose a threat to the Company. Viruses, malware, hacking, phishing, and other security risks are increasingly common. You should thoroughly familiarize yourself with all related policies as well as steps to take to ensure your use of email and internet aren't putting
Air Products informationand your own personal informationin peril. Please note that reputable institutions will never ask for your identification and password when communicating with you via e-mail.

Exhibit 14
Security in Our Computing Environment
We store valuable company information on our computers, on external storage devices and service (e.g., cloud), within our own personal technology devices, and within Air Products' systems. That's why employees must use Air Products' computing environment responsibly and follow policies, standards, and guidelines related to its securitythey are designed to protect our information and safeguard our computing environment from viruses, security breaches, and other "cyber threats." These include details related to appropriate use of systems and hardware, security program installations and encryption processes, password protection, approved application downloads and installations, external storage devices, intranet access, Internet and social media use, measures to secure your PC or site hardware, and more.
Computing assets and systems are intended to be used for business purposes. However, some limited personal use is allowed as long as it doesn't affect business productivity, system efficiency, or the employee's performance or violate any Company policies or standards. It's the employee's responsibility to familiarize himself
or herself with such policies and guidelines as well as complete any required information security-related training.
Data Privacy for Employees and Other Stakeholders
It's the responsibility of the Company and all employees to protect personally identifiable information (PII), just as we do Air Products' corporate information. Examples of PII are personal identification numbers; employment, medical, and financial details; employment records; and similar information. Air Products' employees must also protect information about customers, suppliers, partners, and other stakeholders.
Employee Privacy in Our Computing Environment
Air Products' computing and data storage hardware, software, systems, and applications are Company property. Some e-mail uses are strictly prohibited, including sending illegal, defamatory, offensive, or harassing messages or files; violating copyright laws; unauthorized disclosure of confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information; and sending solicitations for funds.
Since the hardware and software used by employees are the Company's responsibility, individual privacy may not be guaranteed when using any system, including e-mail and instant messaging, with internal or external parties. Employees should not assume that their e-mail is private or personally confidential. The Company reserves the right, to the fullest extent available under applicable regional law, to intercept and scan e-mail and monitor all other systems to ensure appropriate use and compliance with policy, standards, guidelines, and the law.
We can help protect Air Products' information, as well as our own personal information by using our computing environment responsibly and complying with related policies and procedures.

Exhibit 14
Conflicting Personal
Interests
What Might Constitute a Conflict of Interest?
Employees should avoid any situation that involves, or appears to involve, a conflict between their personal interests and the interests of the Company. That means employees should avoid circumstances that might cloud their judgment or impartiality when doing their jobs. If your personal interests or your relationships cause you to feel favoritism (or if it might appear to others that you feel favoritism), a conflict of interests exists.
 -  If an employee or his or her family member is an owner or part-owner of an Air Products customer or supplier company or a consultant, wage earner, or someone who gets other compensation from that company
 -  If an employee would have personal gain from arranging a relationship between Air Products and a customer, supplier, or partner
 -  If an employee receives personal benefits, such as loans or guarantees of obligations, from a customer, supplier, or partner
Examples of where a conflict of interest may arise include:
 -  If an employee is connected with any business that is in direct or indirect competition with Air Products
 -  If an employee discovers an opportunity for personal gain through his or her position or through the use of Company equipment or systems
Investing in shares in companies traded on major public exchanges acquired in an arm's-length transaction as a part of a normal investment program doesn't normally constitute a conflict. If you have questions about whether a situation is a conflict of interest, contact the Law Group or the Corporate Audit Department.
Q My sister is part-owner of a company bidding for a supply agreement with Air Products. It's my job to evaluate the incoming bids. Is this a conflict of interest?
A Yes. Because of your close family tie, you might be perceived as biased in your bid evaluation. You should explain the situation and ask your supervisor to assign someone else to look at and compare the supplier proposals.
16
 
Exhibit 14
Giving or Receiving Gifts during the Course of Business
It's normal and customary for people to give and receive meals or inexpensive entertainment during the course of business. Exchanging high-value gifts or providing or receiving excessive or inappropriate entertainment is unethical and may be illegal. It can be damaging to both your personal business reputation and that of Air Products.
In business relationships, no employee should offer or accept anything of value that might seem to be an attempt to influence business decisions or that might look like a bribe or a payoff. Giving or receiving cash is against Company policy, except in very specific and defined circumstances. It's appropriate to accept reasonable and appropriate meals or entertainment during business interactions, and we're encouraged to reciprocate with similar courtesies to maintain a balanced relationship. But providing or receiving entertainment or gifts that are inappropriate or in excess of that permitted by current Company policies, standards, or guidelines is unethical. Likewise, employees should avoid even inexpensive exchanges when they know or suspect they're against the policy of the other party's company.
The Company sets limits on the amount of goodwill gifts an employee may give or accept, and we are expected to understand these limits. If you have any questions concerning whether any gift or entertainment is excessive or inappropriate, you should consult related Company policies and ask your supervisor or manager, the Audit Department, or the Chief Risk Officer for advice.
Because there are very technical laws and regulations regarding dealings with government employees, gift-giving in these relationships might be illegal. No gifts should be given to government employees without first seeking the approval of your immediate supervisor and a representative of the Law Group.
Q A supplier has suggested meeting at a luxury resort to
discuss our contract, and he has offered to pay for my trip and all associated expenses, including some pricey show tickets. Since this is business-related, can I take the offer?
A No, the supplier's offer exceeds what is considered reasonable and customary by Air Products' policies and guidelines. Accepting such an inappropriate offeror giving gifts, travel, or entertainment in excess of allowable amountscould be perceived as corruption

Interacting with
the Public
Community
Involvement
Air Products has a long-standing tradition of supporting and helping the communities where we operate and where our employees and their families live and work. The Company organizes and sponsors community outreach and education events. Employees from our local sites work together with residents and organizations in their areas to improve both the community and the way we do business. However, employees should always follow Air Products' policies when using Company funds for such outreach and events. Likewise, a non-solicitation policy applies to some situations and/or regions, which prohibits individual employees from fundraising or organizing events. The Community Relations Department, Corporate Communications, or Human Resources can guide employees with questions in this area.
Employee participation during normal working hours is subject to the local manager's discretion in some regions. Joining in community outreach is generally a matter of choice. No employee should feel pressured to participate in any Air Products outreach event or to contribute to company-organized fundraising. During working hours, employee participation is subject to his or her manager's discretion. Political Involvement, Lobbying, Gifts and Contributions
At Air Products, one of our core values is to responsibly care for each other, our communities, and the global environment. Air Products encourages employees, officers, and directors to contribute to the community and to fully participate in local, national, and international politics. However, in doing so, Air Products and its employees must follow the laws governing participation in political affairs, including political contributions, lobbying, and gift giving. In some countries and jurisdictions, political contributions, lobbying, and gift giving are not permitted.
We may not lobby, give gifts, or otherwise try to influence the actions of government officials regarding legislation or other policy decisions on matters relating to Company business unless the action is approved by the
Law Group and/or Corporate Relations.

Communicating with the Public
It's important to coordinate our lobbying efforts. Often employers and employees who engage in lobbying must register to lobby, as must external parties hired by the Company to engage in lobbying activities or make lobbying contacts. It's also Air Products' policy to comply with all laws governing political contributions. And, as a matter of policy, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., as a legal entity, does not make corporate political contributions to candidates in any country or region, even where allowed by law. Employees are free to give a personal contribution to a party or candidate on their own behalf, but they may not make any contribution of Company funds, including petty cash, property, or services, to any political party or committee, or to any candidate for or holder of any office of any government. And they may not seek reimbursement for any such personal contribution. This policy does not prevent, where lawful, the operation of a Political Action Committee ("PAC").
The Air Products Political Alliance (PAC), which is a separate legal entity from
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., makes contributions to U.S. federal and state candidates who support the Company's
interests.
It's particularly important that external communications are accurate and consistent and don't violate confidentiality, applicable laws, privacy rights, or sensitivities. External communications could include those
to customers, journalists, financial analysts and investors, bloggers, participants of social and professional networking sites, our communities, our colleagues in industry, and other members of outside groups. Published information can have a significant effect on Air Products' reputation as
well as have serious business and legal consequences. We should all use caution when communicating outside the Company.
The ease of electronic communication in today's world means Company information that well-intentioned employees casually post or publish or perhaps do not even mean to share broadlycan easily appear on the Web and be found through an Internet search. To be sure that external communications comply with current policies and standards, Air Products requires certain internal reviews.
If you are approached by the media or wish to publish information about your work, contact Corporate Communications for advice. If you are approached by an investor or analyst, contact Investor Relations. Technical papers should include approval from your manager or supervisor and, in some cases, legal review. If you are asked to make an external presentation, consult your supervisor, who may decide to review it with Corporate Communications or the Law Group. These reviews are intended to protect you and the Company from unintended consequences and to present Air Products consistently and professionally. If you have contact with the media or publish information in your outside-of-work activities, specify that you're offering your personal opinion, not necessarily that of Air Products. Likewise, use caution not to disclose sensitive information.

Social Media Use
Ease and speed of electronic communication continues to advance,
and employees should use extra
caution when using these electronic communication tools inside or outside of work. Social networking sites and other electronic forums, both personal and professional, are very popular. It's easy to distribute information to a very broad audience in just a few clicks. But we must take precautions that what we share in social media is not in violation of any Air Products policies or standards designed to protect the safety and security of our information, our business reputation, or the privacy of employees, customers, or partners.
Company information, even that intended for business use, should only be posted by authorized Air Products spokespeople after review by Corporate Communications.
Likewise, if you are using professional networking sites, take care to ensure you're not divulging any sensitive, private, proprietary, or confidential information as part of your resum, curriculum vitae, professional profile, correspondence, or other communication.
I saw some views expressed in postings on an online business community site about Air Products' financial performance. The opinions contain a number of factual errors as well as incorrect assumptions regarding management. Should I correct the errors and post to respond with more positive comments?
No, you should not respond or publish corrections or any other remarks unless you are an authorized Air Products spokesperson. The original posting could be in violation of Air Products' Social Media Standard if the person who authored it was an employee
not authorized to speak on behalf of Air Products. You should report the site to Corporate Communications for consideration. That organization will determine whether a response is appropriate and what action to take.

Exhibit 14
Interacting within
Our Industry
Antitrust and
Competition Laws
We expect our employees to follow the
"letter and spirit" of the antitrust laws
of the United States and the competition laws of any other country or group of countries whose laws apply to our business. That means obeying the clearly defined situations covered by the law as well as the intent of the laws in circumstances that are more complex and ambiguous. If an employee is ever unsure whether an action will violate the law, he or she should consult the
Law Group. Air Products prospers through the merits of our products and services in a free and open competitive marketplace. No employee should assume that profits ever require or
justify illegal actions.
Business competition is a cornerstone of a robust economy, and antitrust and competition laws protect the freedom
of the marketplace. In general, antitrust and competition laws prohibit agreements or actions that may restrain trade or reduce competition. Some of these laws make certain agreements and understandings between competitors per se unlawful. That means they are flatly prohibited and cannot be defended or justified in any way. Whether the understanding or agreement adversely affected
competition is not considered; instead it is presumed to be illegal. For example, per se violations include agreements among competitors to: 1) fix or control
prices or terms, 2) boycott certain suppliers or customers, 3) allocate products, territories or markets, or 4) limit the production or sale of products.
Antitrust and competition laws are complex and difficult to interpret, and they apply to a broad range of corporate activities. Violations can carry serious civil and criminal sanctions. Even the allegation of a violation can be damaging and disruptive to the Company. Great care and attention is expected of employees in a position to affect the commercial actions of the Company.
At a trade association meeting, a representative of one of our competitors approached me with an idea to jointly build a produc-tion facility in a certain region where both companies need more product. It would be in everyone's financial interests. Should I talk further with him about this?
This isn't a decision you can make alone. Whether this joint production effort would be legal is a question that requires careful
thought. You should contact our Law Group to review it with you.
21
 
Exhibit 14
Competitor
Relationships
Contact with competitors can serve legitimate business purposes, such as certain trade association meetings and activities or the discussion of joint business or research ventures. And in some cases we buy from and/or sell to our competitors, so legitimate business dealings must take place. However, employees should use caution in their contacts with competitors because some information should not be freely exchanged. When you have any doubt if a transaction or course of conduct is consistent with Company policy or when considering a joint business or research venture of this kind, you
should consult our Law Group for guidance.
Appropriate Ways to Obtain Competitive Information
Market researchtrying to understand and anticipate the products, plans, and strategies of competitorsis part of good business. This information can be gathered from many legal sources, but there are clear limits. Improper acquisition or use of confidential information of competitors can have serious legal and business consequences. For example, laws in many countries impose severe criminal penalties for individuals or organizations that improperly receive or pass along trade
secrets.
A competitor representative I know suggested that, in a certain region, we are probably both suffering with unnecessarily low margins. She said that we could make life simpler for ourselves by agreeing which of us will get the business of each of the major customers in that region. How should I respond?
This sort of agreement would be illegal, not to mention
unethical, and the legal consequences might be severe. You should make your refusal to consider this very clear. You do not want anyone to be in a position to suggest that you agreed by your actions, even though you did not say "yes." This should be reported to our Law Group.
22
 
Exhibit 14
International Laws
Antiboycott Laws
Some governments refuse to deal with another country's government or their businesses. They target the other country as part of a boycott and try to get others to do the same. These governments try to strengthen their boycott by making other outside customers and suppliers also refuse to do business with the targeted country. The country doing the boycotting tries to apply pressure to these outside countries by saying they must also boycott the targeted country as a condition of doing business in their own country. The United States has laws and regulations generally prohibiting U.S. companies and their foreign and domestic subsidiaries from cooperating with boycotts that the U.S. government does not support. These
laws also require companies to report to
U.S. governmental agencies when they receive written or oral requests to comply with or support such boycotts. What's more, some local laws governing international trade are extra-territorial. That means that a country can enforce its laws beyond its own borders. So if Air Products is in violation of another country's antiboycott laws, it may be held accountable. Always consult the Law Group for guidance if you are uncertain about how international laws may apply to a given situation. Violations may result in criminal and civil penalties and the loss of tax benefits.
Import/Export Laws
Global importing and exporting laws require accurate classification,
valuation, license determination, end- user/end-use screening, record keeping, timely filing, and marking of commodities and technologies crossing international borders. The United States and other governments may restrict, through required licensing, the exportation, importation, or re-exportation of commodities based on factors such as origin, classification, or the dual-use nature of many of our commodities and technologies, as well as the identity of the customer. Exports and re-exports to countries designated "embargoed" under U.S. law or the jurisdiction of the exporting country are prohibited. Violations may result in criminal and civil penalties and loss of exporting or importing privileges.
I just won a supply bid for Air Products, but the draft contract contains a provision requiring that we agree not to use components or persons from a certain country in performing the contract. We don't need to use anything from that country, but is signing it against U.S. antiboycott law?
The Law Group needs to review this contract (and any contract).
In this case, the boycott language contained in all documentation must be removed or appropriately amended. These details cannot be replaced with a verbal agreement either, so use caution when speaking to the customer.
23
 
Exhibit 14
Global Anti-bribery and Corrupt Practices Laws
As a U.S. Company, Air Products must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). That Act prohibits payments and offers of payments of anything of value to foreign officials, political parties, or candidates for foreign political office to get, keep, or direct business. And claiming not to know of the wrongdoing will not serve as a defense where circumstances
should reasonably have alerted you to it. Payments made indirectly through intermediaries, such as sales agents and consultants, when most people would understand that such payments are being passed along for prohibited purposes, are also illegal.
In addition to certain prohibited actions, the law also requires internal
accounting control and record keeping by the Company in connection with any payments by its foreign subsidiaries.
The issues presented by this law are more complex than they may at first appear. For example, although you might not consider the term "foreign official" to include employees of businesses owned by a foreign government, the law would generally consider them to be "foreign officials." To complicate things further, certain exceptions exist in the law. For these reasons and others, the assistance of the Law Group is essential for working through the complexities of the issues encountered in connection with complying with this law.
Other countries, including many of the major industrialized countries in Western Europe and Asia, have or are enacting similar laws. Recent examples include laws in the U.K. and the People's Republic of China. It's important to note that in many countries both international and local laws may applysome laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act
2010, are extra-territorial; that is, they
reach beyond the boundaries of their own countries to apply to acts of
bribery committed overseas. Many such laws apply a broad definition to "public official" or "corrupt practices" and state that local custom or practice, if questionable regarding corruption and bribes, must be disregarded. The law always takes precedence. We must never sacrifice our integrity, not even
for profit or ease of business.
The U.K. Bribery Act 2010, for example, contains two broad categories of offensethe offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting of an advantagein business transactions involving either government officials or private parties. But the Act itself is complex, and legal repercussions can be severe, including imprisonment and unlimited fines. Under the Act, companies are required not only to refuse participation in bribes or other unethical practices for business preference but to have adequate

measures in place to prevent corruption and bribery. Unlike the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 does not permit facilitation payments, which are sometimes requested to induce public officials in some countries to perform their function, such as issuing permits or licenses. While these payments may have been allowed in some cases in the past, Air Products' employees and other associated parties are prohibited from paying facilitation payments to any foreign official except in very exceptional cases with prior approval from the Law Group.
Under certain circumstances, Air Products could be found guilty of bribery for actions taken by third parties or "associated parties" acting on our
behalf. Associated parties include joint venture partners, agents, distributors, employees of outside service providers, or subcontractors who perform services on our behalf. It is important that employees of Air Products remain alert
for any suspicious behavior or events
and report them to the Corporate Risk
Office, the Law Group, or their manager.
As an Air Products employee, you must always be familiar with existing policies for global competition and international trade. You may also be required to submit certifications of ethical conduct, complete related role- or position-based training, or take steps to dispel even the impression of corruption or unfairness. Your manager or supervisor or the Law Group can assist if you're unclear about any situation. You should never hesitate to ask questions or express concerns on this important legal area.
Before doing business outside of your home country, you need to have a working knowledge of the laws and policies of the countries in which you will be doing business. If you have questions about any International Law matter, please contact the Law Group.
You should consult the Law Group for advice, Regardless of the amount of the fee or the popularity of such exchanges in local business practice, such payments may be interpreted as bribery under some laws. Many of the countries where Air Products does business have anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, some of which are extra-territorial. That means that the law applies even if the transactions take place outside the borders of the country
imposing the law. We must never engage in exchanges that might be considered bribery or corruption, even if refusing might delay our plans or impact our profit.

Air Products is a global company with operations in more than 40 countries. As such, its financial accounting and reporting is also governed by local statutory requirements. U.S. law, local statutory requirements and Air Products' policies all require honest and accurate financial reporting.
Honest reporting means a full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in all documents. Air Products files complete financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and issues financial summaries in other public statements and communications. It is essential that these statements be accurate and honest to allow us to comply with the law and investor expectations.
Accurate reporting also helps us make good decisions for our businesses and operations. So our continued business success demands it too.
Employees should accurately prepare all business records (accounts, invoices, travel and entertainment expense reports, payrolls, reports, and books) and record all financial transactions in a timely manner. Financial transactions should be recorded in accordance with Air Products' Finance Policies and Standards and local regulations and accounting rules as appropriate.
My boss asked me to play with some numbers so that our results for this quarter would look better, and then fix it next quarter.
She implied that my job would be at risk if I don't do it. I don't feel right about it, but I'm scared. What should I do?
Do the right thingaccurate and timely reporting is the law. Implied threats to your employment or attempts to intimidate employees into unethical behavior won't be tolerated for any reason. You should report the conversation to your manager's supervisor or call the IntegrityLine.

Third Quarter Summary
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (July 24, 2012)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $303 million* and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41* on a non-GAAP, continuing operations basis, for its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2012. This excludes a $.25 per share gain associated with acquiring the additional 50 percent equity interest in Air Products' existing DA NanoMaterials joint venture.
Results from discontinued operations of $.60 per share include a gain of $.70 per share associated with the sale of the Continental Europe Homecare business. These results also include a $.14 per share impairment associated with the planned disposal of the remaining Homecare business, primarily in the UK, and the income from the remaining Homecare business of $.04 per share.
On a GAAP basis, including discontinued operations, income and diluted EPS for the quarter were $485 million and $2.26 respectively.
The discussion of third quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP continuing operations comparisons that exclude these items. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Third Quarter Financial Results
Third quarter revenues of $2,340 million decreased five percent versus prior year, primarily on lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar. Underlying sales were up one percent, largely due to higher pricing in the Merchant Gases segment. Operating income of $397 million was up two percent on improved cost performance, partially offset by a stronger dollar. Operating margin of 17 percent increased 130 basis points versus prior year.
Sequentially, while overall sales were unchanged, underlying sales grew one percent due to higher volumes. Better cost performance drove operating income up six percent and operating margin increased 100 basis points sequentially.
Commenting on the quarter, John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Economic growth this quarter was below what we expected in Asia, Europe and Electronics. Despite headwinds from the economy and a stronger dollar, we were able to deliver earnings within expectations due to excellent cost performance. In addition, we recently executed several key strategic activities, including the purchase of our majority position in Indura, taking full ownership of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture and the sale of our Continental Europe Homecare business."
 
 
 
Third Quarter Segment Performance
 
Sequentially, sales decreased one percent, due to a stronger dollar. Sequential operating income increased eight percent and margins of 18.8% were up 160 basis points on better cost performance.
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "The current economic uncertainty continues to impact our near-term volume growth. To offset this, we will continue to deliver productivity and cost reduction to the bottom line. In the longer-term, we remain confident in the growth prospects for industrial gases and Air Products. Our recent Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions and Homecare portfolio actions demonstrate our emphasis on execution and position us well for future growth and profitability."
Air Products expects fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.42 and $1.47 per share. The company's adjusted guidance for continuing operations for fiscal 2012 is $5.40 to $5.45 per share.

(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment.
On 8 January 2012, we reached an agreement for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain. This business represented approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues.
The transaction with Linde closed on 30 April 2012. Total sale proceeds of 590 million ($777) were received in cash at closing. This amount included contingent proceeds of 110 million ($144) related to the outcome of certain retender arrangements. The gain related to the contingent proceeds is deferred in other noncurrent liabilities and will be recognized in the results of discontinued operations when the contingencies are resolved and the final proceeds are realized per the terms of the agreement. We will also be entitled to receive up to 32 million ($42) of additional cash proceeds based upon collection of accounts receivable. A gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share) was recognized on the sale of this business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
We are actively marketing the remaining portion of the Homecare business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom. We expect to close on the sale of this business before the end of calendar 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) to write down the remaining business to its estimated net realizable value. Additional charges may be recorded in future periods dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition.
The Homecare business is being accounted for as a discontinued operation. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
2. COST REDUCTION PLAN
During the second quarter ended 31 March 2012, we initiated a cost reduction plan. The results from continuing operations for the nine months ended 30 June 2012 include a charge of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for this plan. This charge represents the ongoing actions we are taking to improve our cost structure, particularly in Europe. The plan includes removing the stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business and the actions we are taking to right-size our European business cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook.
This charge includes $80.8 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions from our workforce. The remainder of the charge, $6.0, is related to the write-down of certain assets. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. The charge for the cost reduction plan is excluded from segment operating profit. The charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC
On 29 February 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials). DA NanoMaterials' revenues for calendar year 2011 were approximately $90.
The acquisition closed on 2 April 2012 for $158 ($147 net of cash acquired of $11), subject to working capital adjustments, and was accounted for as a business combination. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment.
Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The three and nine months ended 30 June 2012 include a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. This gain is reflected on the consolidated income statements as "Gain on previously held equity interest."
 
 
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENT- Indura S.A.
On 1 July 2012, we acquired a 51.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., from the majority shareholder. On 3 July 2012, we acquired an additional 13.0% equity interest from other shareholders. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.9 billion ($699) and assumed debt of CLP97.0 billion ($196) for these interests. This preliminary purchase price is subject to working capital and debt adjustments which have not yet been completed. Under the purchase agreement, we have a commitment to purchase up to an additional 2.0% equity interest within the next twelve months. The agreement also provides the largest minority shareholder a right to exercise a put option to require Air Products to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015, at a redemption value equal to fair market value (subject to a minimum price per share linked to the original acquisition date value escalated by an inflation factor). Founded in 1948, Indura S.A. is the largest independent industrial gas company in South America. Indura S.A.'s integrated gas and retail business comprises packaged gases and hardgoods, liquid bulk, healthcare and on-sites. Indura S.A.'s revenues for calendar year 2011 were approximately $480.
4. INCOME TAXES
Q1 Spanish Tax Settlement
We were challenged by the Spanish tax authorities over income tax deductions taken by certain of our Spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005-2011. Although we continue to believe that all positions taken were compliant with applicable laws, in November 2011 we reached a settlement with the Spanish tax authorities for 41.3 million ($56) in resolution of all tax issues under examination. Of this settlement, $43.8 ($.20 per share) increased our income tax expense and had a 3.8% impact on our effective tax rate for the nine months ended 30 June 2012. The cash payment for the settlement was principally paid in January 2012.
Q2 Spanish Tax Ruling
As of 30 September 2011, our unrecognized tax benefits included an amount related to certain transactions of a Spanish subsidiary for years 1991 and 1992, a period before we controlled this subsidiary. In March 2009, the Spanish appeals court (Audiencia Nacional) ruled in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. The Spanish government appealed this court decision to the Spanish Supreme Court, and as a result, we did not reverse the liability accrued for these unrecognized tax benefits. On 25 January 2012, the Spanish Supreme Court released its decision affirming the decision of the Audiencia Nacional in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. As a result, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $58.3 ($.27 per share), including interest and penalties, and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. The reduction in income tax expense had a 5.1% impact on our effective tax rate for the nine months ended 30 June 2012.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

Fourth Quarter Summary
 
 
 
 
 
 
Full Year Summary
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 19, 2012)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $305 million* and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42* on a non-GAAP, continuing operations basis, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2012. This excludes: an after-tax impairment charge of $127 million, or $0.59 per share, for the restructuring of our photovoltaic business; an after-tax charge of $35 million, or $0.16 per share, for exiting the polyurethane intermediates business; and an after-tax charge of $6 million, or $0.03 per share, to write-down assets following a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown.
On a GAAP basis, net income and diluted EPS from continuing operations were $137 million and $0.64, respectively, for the quarter.
The discussion of fourth quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP continuing operations. A reconciliation to GAAP results can be found at the end of this release.*
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,606 million increased four percent versus prior year. On an underlying basis, sales were up four percent on higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Acquisitions contributed six percent, which was offset by lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar. Operating income of $408 million was up three percent versus prior year. Operating margin of 15.7 percent was down 10 basis points.
Sequential sales grew 11 percent, with underlying sales up three percent on higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Acquisitions contributed six percent. Operating income grew three percent sequentially.
For fiscal 2012, sales of $9,612 million decreased one percent, with base volume growth and acquisitions more than offset by lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar. Operating income of $1,534 million was down one percent and diluted EPS of $5.40 increased one percent from the prior year.
 
 
 
Commenting on the fiscal year, John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The fourth quarter was a continuation of the economic trends that we have seen throughout the year, with global manufacturing growth continuing to slow. This has led to weak volumes in 2012, which we have been able to offset with increased productivity and cost reductions.
"During this past year we made a number of portfolio moves, including selling our European homecare business, purchasing Indura to enhance our Latin American position; buying the other half of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture; and taking a 25% stake in AHG, the largest industrial gases company in Saudi Arabia. In this most recent quarter, we continued our efforts to further position ourselves for the future by exiting our polyurethane intermediates business and restructuring our photovoltaic businesses."
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "We are starting our 2013 fiscal year with weak economic momentum worldwide. Our focus will be on taking actions in the areas that we believe can have the greatest impact on improving margins and returns. They include loading our Merchant assets, executing our new Tonnage investments on time and on budget; continuing to make improvements in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and achieving even better productivity."
The company today announced initial guidance for fiscal year 2013 EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.85 per share. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ending December 31, 2012, EPS is expected to be between $1.26 and $1.31 per share.
The company also announced that it expects capital spending in fiscal year 2013 to be between $2.0 and $2.2 billion.

(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment.
On 8 January 2012, we reached an agreement for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain. This business represented approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues.
The transaction with Linde closed on 30 April 2012. Total sale proceeds of 590 million ($777) were received in cash at closing. This amount included contingent proceeds of 110 million ($144) related to the outcome of certain retender arrangements. The gain related to the contingent proceeds is deferred in other noncurrent liabilities and will be recognized in the results of discontinued operations when the contingencies are resolved and the final proceeds are realized per the terms of the agreement. We are also entitled to additional cash proceeds based upon collection of accounts receivable. As of 30 September 2012, 26 million ($32) was received and we anticipate receipt of the remaining 6 million ($8) during the next fiscal year. A gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share) was recognized on the sale of this business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
We are actively marketing the remaining portion of the Homecare business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom. We hope to close on the sale of this business before the end of calendar year 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) to write down the remaining business to its estimated net realizable value. Additional charges may be recorded in future periods dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition.
The Homecare business is being accounted for as a discontinued operation. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.
2. BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND COST REDUCTION PLANS
In 2012, the company recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring actions and cost reduction plans in our Polyurethane Intermediates, Electronics and European Merchant businesses. The net loss is reflected on the consolidated income statements as "Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans." The charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income.
During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business and actions we are taking to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. This charge includes $80.8 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions and $6.0 for the write-down of certain assets. The charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed actions in the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business to improve costs resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share). The company sold certain assets and the rights to a supply contract for $32.7 in cash at closing. A supply arrangement with terms at fair market value was established with the buyer to serve the retained product supply contracts so that our PUI production facility in Pasadena, TX could permanently close. In connection with these actions, we recognized an expense of $26.6, for the net book value of assets sold and those committed to be disposed other than by sale. The remaining charge was primarily related to contract terminations and an environmental liability. The PUI facility will be dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2013. The costs to dismantle will be expensed as incurred and reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment. Since we will have material ongoing involvement with the business through retained PUI product supply contracts, the results of this business will continue to be reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases Segment.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic (PV) market resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Air Products supplies the PV market with both bulk and onsite supply of gases including silane. The PV market has not developed as expected and as a result, the market capacity to produce silane is expected to exceed demand for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have entered into negotiations to terminate a long-term, take-or-pay contract. We recorded a charge of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate the contract. Although a settlement could differ from this amount, we do not expect it to be material to our financial position. It is uncertain when a settlement will be reached. The remaining charge was recorded in connection with the expected loss on purchase commitments, the disposal of certain assets serving PV and Electronics customers, the write-down of inventory to its net realizable value, and the write-down of accounts receivable.
 
 
 
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Indura S.A.
On 1 July 2012, we acquired a 51.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., from the majority shareholder. On 3 July 2012, we acquired an additional 13.0% equity interest from other shareholders. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements. The portion of the business that is not owned by the company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. This preliminary purchase price is subject to working capital and debt adjustments which have not yet been completed. Under the purchase agreement, we have a commitment to purchase an additional 2.0% equity interest within twelve months of the acquisition date. The agreement also provides the largest minority shareholder a right to exercise a put option to require Air Products to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015, at a redemption value equal to fair market value (subject to a minimum price based upon the acquisition date value escalated by an inflation factor). Prior to the acquisition, Indura S.A. was the largest independent industrial gas company in South America. Indura S.A.'s integrated gas and retail business comprises packaged gases and hardgoods, liquid bulk, healthcare and on-sites.
The acquisition of Indura S.A. was accounted for as a business combination. The results of Indura S.A. have been consolidated within our Merchant Gases business segment. For the quarter ended 30 September 2012, our Merchant Gases business segment includes Indura S.A. revenues of $140.0 and operating income of $9.3, which is net of acquisition related costs we incurred of $5.6.
DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC
On 29 February 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials). DA NanoMaterials' revenues for calendar year 2011 were approximately $90.
The acquisition closed on 2 April 2012 for $158 ($147 net of cash acquired of $11) and was accounted for as a business combination. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment.
Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The fiscal year ended 30 September 2012 includes a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. This gain is reflected on the consolidated income statements as "Gain on previously held equity interest."
4. INCOME TAXES
Q1 Spanish Tax Settlement
We were challenged by the Spanish tax authorities over income tax deductions taken by certain of our Spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005-2011. Although we continue to believe that all positions taken were compliant with applicable laws, in November 2011 we reached a settlement with the Spanish tax authorities for 41.3 million ($56) in resolution of all tax issues under examination. Of this settlement, $43.8 ($.20 per share) increased our income tax expense and had a 3.3% impact on our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2012. The cash payment for the settlement was principally paid in January 2012.
Q2 Spanish Tax Ruling
As of 30 September 2011, our unrecognized tax benefits included an amount related to certain transactions of a Spanish subsidiary for years 1991 and 1992, a period before we controlled this subsidiary. In March 2009, the Spanish appeals court (Audiencia Nacional) ruled in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. The Spanish government appealed this court decision to the Spanish Supreme Court, and as a result, we did not reverse the liability accrued for these unrecognized tax benefits. On 25 January 2012, the Spanish Supreme Court released its decision affirming the decision of the Audiencia Nacional in favor of our Spanish subsidiary. As a result, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $58.3 ($.27 per share), including interest and penalties, and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. The reduction in income tax expense had a 4.4% impact on our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2012.
 
 
 
5. CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY
As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. The customer, which received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment's results. We do not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

On December 12, 2012, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Proxy Statement for its 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held on January 24, 2013. The Company is providing additional information with respect to its Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which shareholders are requested to approve at the Annual Meeting.
Page 10 of the Proxy Statement contains an error relating to authorized shares still available for awards under the Plan. The proxy statement should have disclosed that, as of September 30, 2012, 3,974,353 previously authorized shares were still available for awards under the Plan.
As noted on page 8, no more than 20% of the shares of Company stock subject to Plan awards granted after fiscal year 2001 can be used for full value awards ("20% limit"). As of September 30, 2012, less than 13% of shares used for Plan awards since 2001 were used for full value awards. Because the 20% limit is cumulative, and less than 20% of shares subject to awards granted since 2001 have been used for full value awards, 2,677,697 of the authorized shares still available for use under the Plan could be used for full value awards under the terms of the Plan.

First Quarter Summary
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 23, 2013)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $277 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30, on a continuing operations basis, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2012, both up three* percent versus the prior year.
The discussion of first quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP continuing operations. A reconciliation to GAAP results can be found on page four of this release.*
First quarter revenues of $2,562 million increased 10 percent versus prior year, with underlying sales up four percent on improved volumes in Tonnage Gases. Acquisitions contributed six percent. Operating income of $372 million was up five percent versus prior year. Operating margin of 14.5 percent was down 70 basis points versus prior year, driven by an inventory accounting revaluation and the Indura acquisition.
Sequential sales declined two percent, with underlying sales down four percent and seasonally lower volumes in the Merchant Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Operating income decreased nine percent sequentially.
Commenting on the first quarter, John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Globally, economic growth underperformed our expectations for the quarter. We delivered higher volumes in Tonnage Gases, and Equipment and Energy. However, both Merchant Gases and Electronics volumes declined. Our operating performance was encouraging and we are seeing improvements from our cost and restructuring actions. It's a positive start that we expect to improve upon through the year. We also repurchased 5.7 million shares during the quarter."
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "Global economic growth is expected to be modest at best so we will continue to take actions to improve our performance. Solid execution, cost control, price improvement and volume growth are our priorities. Our strong project backlog and our significant leverage in existing assets position us well for the future."
Air Products is updating its guidance for fiscal 2013 of EPS in the range of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. For the second quarter of fiscal 2013 ending March 31, 2013, EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.39 per share.

Certain facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as capital leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests.

Second Quarter Summary
 
 
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 23, 2013)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $289 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37, on a continuing operations basis, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2013, up three* percent and five* percent respectively versus prior year.
The discussion of second quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP continuing operations. A reconciliation to GAAP results can be found on page four of this release.*
Second quarter revenues of $2,484 million increased six percent versus prior year, with underlying sales down two percent due to the previously announced decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates business (PUI). Acquisitions contributed six percent. Operating income of $390 million was up four percent versus prior year. Operating margin of 15.7 percent was down 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily on acquisitions and higher pension expense, partially offset by better cost performance.
Sequential sales declined three percent, with underlying sales down three percent on lower Tonnage Gases volumes due to planned customer maintenance. Operating income increased five percent sequentially, primarily from the inventory accounting revaluation last quarter and better cost performance.
Commenting on the second quarter, John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Good cost performance helped offset weaker than expected volumes in the second quarter. Global economic growth continued to be a challenge, with a slower U.S., contraction in Europe, softness in China, and an electronics market much weaker than we expected. Despite these difficult conditions, we were able to deliver bottom-line earnings growth in the first half of the year by focusing on superior execution and cost discipline. With a project backlog totaling over $3 billion and significant leverage to an economic recovery, Air Products remains well positioned for growth over the long-term."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Looking ahead, McGlade said, "Given the weakness we saw coming out of Q2, we are tempering our expectations for economic growth in the second half of our fiscal year. We remain focused on those things within our control, including reliable plant operations, disciplined project execution, capital allocation, and further productivity improvements. In light of our view of continuing slow growth, we are actively assessing whether there are additional actions we can take that would result in increased value to our shareholders."
Air Products expects third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be between $1.33 and $1.38 per share. The company's adjusted guidance for continuing operations for fiscal 2013 is a range of $5.45 to $5.60 per share.
