ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On April 3, 2003, the Registrant issued the following press release announcing that the Lumberton, North Carolina plant will discontinue producing cotton linter pulp by mid-2003 and conference call regarding the partial closure and recent management changes. News from Buckeye FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Kris Matula, Senior Vice President 901-320-8588 Gordon Mitchell, Investor Relations Manager 901-320-8256 Website: www.bkitech.com BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES PARTIAL SHUTDOWN OF LUMBERTON, N.C. PLANT MEMPHIS, TN April 3, 2003 - Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it will discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at its Lumberton, North Carolina facility by mid-2003. The Company will continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at that location. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, "While cotton linter pulp is a core Buckeye business, we can no longer economically justify operating a facility which can only produce products for paper applications. The cotton fiber paper industry has contracted by about one-third since the late 1990's. Buckeye will better meet customer needs by consolidating U.S. cotton linter pulp production at our larger Memphis, Tennessee facility which is capable of producing products for both chemical and paper applications. This consolidation will enable us to improve our overall cotton linter pulp operating results by at least $6 million annually on a going basis and reduce working capital needs by about $10 million. The more efficient operating configuration will improve our results beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2004." Mr. Ferraro further commented, "It is extremely unfortunate that business conditions are forcing us to terminate approximately 100 dedicated employees. The Company will incur one-time costs in the April-June quarter of approximately $2 million for the partial closure, including related employee termination expenses. Additionally, we will include a non-cash asset impairment charge which relates primarily to this facility of about $18 million after tax in our January-March financial results." Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for 1:00 PM Central Time Friday, April 4, to further discuss the Lumberton plant partial shutdown and the Company's recent organizational changes. All interested parties are invited to dial in at 888-855-5428 (U.S.) or 719-457-2665 (International).

EXHIBIT 99.1 News from Buckeye Technologies Inc. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Kris Matula, Senior Vice President 901-320-8588 Gordon Mitchell Investor Relations Manager 901-320-8256 Website: www.bkitech.com BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES JANUARY-MARCH RESULTS MEMPHIS, TN April 22, 2003 - Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that its net sales in the quarter ended March 31, 2003 were $163.5 million, essentially equal to the comparable quarter of the prior year. During January-March the Company incurred a loss of one cent per share (net loss of $0.4 million after tax), excluding the previously disclosed non-cash asset impairment charge of 52 cents per share (net loss of $19.3 million after tax), which primarily related to the partial closure of the Lumberton, North Carolina cotton linter pulp plant. Excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, the Company's after tax loss is a $3 million improvement versus the loss incurred in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman David B. Ferraro commented, "The combination of energy cost increases and a raw material write-down led to a small operating loss in the just completed quarter. However, we are pleased to report continued progress in reducing our net debt. The Company's net debt stood at $609.2 million on March 31, which is down $17.6 million from December 31 and $48.7 million below March 31 a year ago. Reducing debt is a strategic imperative for the Company." Mr. Ferraro added, "We are also pleased that January-March sales were 6.8% above the immediately preceding quarter. The increased demand for our products enabled us to reduce inventories by $6 million from the December 31 level. These higher sales, combined with the price increases that we are implementing, are indications that our business is improving." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty cellulose and absorbent products, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, Ireland and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Buckeye Reports Fourth Quarter Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 31, 2003--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a loss of $5.2 million after tax (14 cents per share) in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The loss was due to a $5.4 million after tax impairment of idle equipment, principally an uninstalled airlaid machine acquired with the purchase of Walkisoft in 1999, and severance payments to employees at the Lumberton plant whose closure was previously announced. Excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, the Company achieved one cent earnings per share ($0.2 million after tax) in April-June 2003. This compares to a loss of seven cents per share ($2.6 million after tax) in the same period a year ago, which excluded impairment and restructuring charges of $6.9 million after tax. During fiscal year 2003, the Company incurred a loss of $24.9 million after tax (67 cents per share), including impairment and restructuring costs of $24.7 million after tax (also 67 cents per share). This compares to a loss of $26 million after tax (74 cents per share) in fiscal year 2002, which included a $19.1 million after tax (54 cents per share) impairment and restructuring charge. Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the Company's results improved by 19 cents per share from a loss of $6.9 million after tax in fiscal year 2002 (20 cents per share) to a loss of $0.2 million after tax in fiscal year 2003 (one cent per share). Net sales for the April-June quarter were $168 million, 5% above the $160.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for fiscal year 2003 were $641.1 million, 1% above the $635.2 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented that, "April-June was another challenging quarter. We have strengthened our operations by increasing productivity and achieving numerous cost reductions. Pricing and product mix of our specialty cellulose business is improving, and we intend to reduce our fluff pulp production substantially over the next several years. This shift of a higher percentage of our products to specialty applications will improve our results in fiscal year 2004 and beyond." Mr. Ferraro went on to say, "Our focus remains on debt reduction. During the year we just completed, we reduced our net debt by $25.4 million (from $630.4 million to $605 million). As we go forward, we plan to limit capital spending to $40 million in fiscal year 2004 and apply our free cash flow to further debt reduction."

The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, Ireland and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Exhibit Buckeye Reports First Quarter Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 20, 2003--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a loss of $2.4 million after-tax (seven cents per share) in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The loss was due to a $2.1 million after-tax expense (six cents per share) for the early extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of $150 million of 8.5% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and previously announced restructuring charges of $0.6 million after-tax (two cents per share). Excluding the expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt and restructuring noted above, the Company earned a profit of one cent per share ($0.3 million after-tax) in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. This compares to a loss of one cent per share ($0.5 million after-tax) in the same period a year ago. Net sales for the July-September quarter were $155.8 million, slightly below the $156.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman David B. Ferraro commented, "Sales during the just completed quarter, which is always our seasonally slowest quarter, were restrained by our need to maintain adequate inventories during our major Foley plant maintenance shutdown which was conducted during the first eight days of October. The shutdown was completed in an exemplary fashion with all major projects being accomplished as planned and, importantly, with no serious injuries or safety incidents. The Foley plant is now back to operating at its full productive capacity." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "The major accomplishment of the July-September quarter was our successful placement of $200 million of senior notes which have a maturity date of October 2013 and a coupon of 8.5%. This debt placement, combined with the refinancing of our bank credit facility, which is currently in progress, ensures that the Company will have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for the next five years." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty cellulose and absorbent products, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, Ireland and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and certain other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our revolving credit facility, and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants.

(NYSE:BKI) announced today that it has established a $220 million senior credit facility comprised of a $70 million revolving loan facility and a $150 million term loan facility. This facility amends and restates the Company's existing $215 million revolving credit facility. Buckeye Chairman David B.

This refinancing, together with the previously closed $200 million senior notes offering due in 2013, greatly enhances the company's financial flexibility, as we will now face no meaningful debt maturities before 2008. We appreciate the support provided by Fleet, Citibank and UBS in securing this senior credit facility."

The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, Ireland and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On December 16, 2003, the Registrant issued the following press releases. News from [OBJECT OMITTED] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Kris Matula, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 901-320-8588 Gordon Mitchell Investor Relations Manager 901-320-8256 Website: www.bkitech.com BUCKEYE EXPECTS TO REPORT EARNINGS LOSS FOR THE OCTOBER-DECEMBER QUARTER MEMPHIS, TN December 16, 2003 - Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects to incur a loss of 27-30 cents per share for the quarter ending December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates the October-December quarter will be negatively impacted 16-19 cents per share by the following factors: - - Lenzing Fibers, a specialty cellulose customer which owes Buckeye $3.7 million, has recently filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy. The Company is uncertain of the amount it will be able to recover and is establishing a reserve that will negatively impact earnings by six cents per share. - - During the quarter, the Company incurred high manufacturing costs and reduced production at both its Foley, Florida wood pulp mill and its Memphis, Tennessee cotton cellulose facility. The poor operations traced to maintenance work accomplished in early October at each location. The Foley plant had difficulty reestablishing stable operations following the maintenance shutdown, and the Memphis plant was impacted by the startup of new equipment and processes associated with the production of paper grade products previously produced at the recently closed Lumberton cotton cellulose plant. Although both plants have now returned to normal operations, the reliability issues will reduce October-December earnings by approximately four to five cents per share. - - A one-time retroactive payment as a part of the Foley labor agreement signed in October will reduce earnings by two cents per share. - - Seasonally weak nonwovens sales will reduce earnings by two to three cents per share. - - The impact of the strong Canadian dollar and Euro on the results at our Canadian and Glueckstadt, Germany facilities are expected to reduce earnings by two to three cents per share. In addition to the operating items listed above, the Company expects to incur previously reported refinancing and restructuring charges which will further reduce earnings by about 11 cents per share.
Sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2003 are expected to be at or above the levels achieved in both the year ago quarter and the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2003. Buckeye Chairman David B. Ferraro commented, "Although the high costs we have recently experienced are very disappointing, they are related to special situations and one-time events in the current quarter. The combination of sales increases and cost reductions now being implemented gives us confidence we will be profitable in the January-March quarter." Buckeye, which plans to announce its earnings for the quarter on January 21, 2004, has scheduled a conference call at 10:30 a.m. EST, Wednesday, December 17, 2003 to further discuss these issues. All interested parties are invited to join the call by dialing 800-888-5452 (U.S.) or 719-867-0660 (International). Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty cellulose and absorbent products, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

(NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a loss of $10.0 million after tax (27 cents per share) in the quarter ended December 31, 2003.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility which had availability of $55.2 million on December 31, 2003, and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.).

(NYSE:BKI) today announced that it will discontinue producing airlaid nonwoven materials at its Cork, Ireland facility by August. The Company will continue to meet customer needs for airlaid nonwoven materials by producing these products at its facilities in Delta, British Columbia, Canada; Steinfurt, Germany; and Gaston, North Carolina. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, "Airlaid nonwoven materials are a very important part of Buckeye's product portfolio. Although we will cease production at the small single-line Cork plant, we will meet current and anticipated needs for these materials by increasing output at our three larger facilities. This consolidation will enable us to improve our overall airlaid nonwoven materials operating results by about $7 million annually and reduce working capital needs by about $4 million. We will begin to realize these benefits in the October-December quarter and anticipate achieving all the savings by the end of fiscal 2005." Mr. Ferraro further commented, "It is extremely unfortunate that market conditions necessitate closure of the Cork facility and termination of approximately 83 dedicated employees. The Company will incur restructuring costs, including employee termination expenses, of approximately $3 million during the next six months. Additionally, we will include a non-cash asset impairment charge relating to the Cork facility of about $27 million after tax in our March financial results." Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for April 2, 2004 9:30 a.m. CST to further discuss the Cork plant closure. All interested parties are invited to dial in at (800) 946-0785 (U.S.) or (719) 457-2661 (International).

Exhibit Buckeye Announces January-March Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2004--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a loss of $27.5 million after tax (74 cents per share) in the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The loss was due to $28.6 million after tax in restructuring and impairment charges, primarily relating to the previously announced closure of its Cork, Ireland nonwovens manufacturing facility. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company incurred a loss of $19.7 million (53 cents per share) which included $19.3 million after tax in restructuring and impairment charges, primarily relating to the partial closure of the Lumberton, North Carolina cotton linter pulp plant. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges in both years, the Company earned $1.1 million after tax (three cents per share) in January-March 2004 which compares to a loss of $0.4 million after tax (minus one cent per share) in January-March 2003. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $172.8 million, six percent above the $163.5 million in the same quarter in the prior year and eight percent above the $160.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter which ended December 31, 2003. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "The improvement in sales and operating earnings which we achieved in the past quarter give us confidence that we are on the road to recovery. We are beginning to benefit from both the operational changes we've made and strengthening conditions in our markets. However, our margins remain below satisfactory levels, and we recognize that further improvement is needed. We remain committed to restoring our profitability to historical levels." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty cellulose and absorbent products, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, Ireland and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility which had availability of $64.5 million on March 31, 2004, and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.).

(NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $1.4 million after tax ($.04 per share) in the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The Company's results include $2 million after tax in restructuring and impairment charges primarily related to the previously announced closures of its facilities in Cork, Ireland and Lumberton, North Carolina. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company incurred a loss of $5.2 million after tax ($.14 per share) which included $5.4 million after tax in restructuring and impairment charges, primarily relating to the partial closure of the Lumberton plant and the impairment of idle nonwovens equipment. Excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, the Company earned $3.4 million after tax ($.09 per share) in April-June 2004. This compares to earnings of $0.2 million after tax ($.01 per share) in the same period a year ago. During fiscal year 2004, the Company incurred a loss of $38.2 million after tax ($1.03 per share) including impairment, restructuring, and refinancing costs of $36.6 million after tax ($.99 per share). This compares to a loss of $24.9 million after tax ($.67 per share) in fiscal 2003, which included a $24.7 million after tax impairment and restructuring charge (also $.67 per share). Net sales for the April-June quarter were $168 million, equal to sales in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for fiscal 2004 were $656.9 million, 2.5% above the $641.1 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, "Although fiscal 2004 was a disappointing year for Buckeye, we are encouraged by recent strengthening trends in our markets. The restructuring steps we have taken are improving our efficiency and enabling us to more effectively utilize our capacity. We are confident that we have implemented the right plans to improve future earnings." Mr. Ferraro went on to say, "During April-June, we achieved a gross margin of 15.5%, which represents a 3.4 percentage point improvement over the 12.1% gross margin achieved during the year ago quarter. We remain committed to achieving additional margin improvement and restoring our profitability to historical levels." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fiber and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

We calculate EBITDA as earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting plus net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.) On June 30, 2004, we had borrowing capacity of $67.7 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004, our add back was limited to $492 of the $2,073 of restructuring expense recorded during the quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.) On June 30, 2004, we had borrowing capacity of $67.7 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004, our add back was limited to $492 of the $2,073 of restructuring expense recorded during the quarter.

MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2004--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $4.4 million after tax (12 cents per share) in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Company's results include $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) in restructuring costs, primarily related to the previously announced closure of its facility in Cork, Ireland. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company's restated net income was $3.1 million after tax (8 cents per share) which included $5.7 million after tax benefit (15 cents per share) from an accounting change related to its method of accounting for planned maintenance shutdowns. July-September 2003 also included $2.7 million after tax charge (minus 7 cents per share) related to the early extinguishment of debt and restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of accounting changes and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt and restructuring, the Company earned $5.2 million after tax in July-September 2004 compared to $0.1 million after tax in the same period a year ago. Net sales for the July-September quarter were $167.3 million, 7.4% above the $155.8 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "We made progress during July-September in improving the financial performance of our business. Revenue and profitability increased in both our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials segments. We reduced debt by $20 million. The changes we have made to improve our operations are having a positive impact." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "We ceased producing airlaid nonwoven materials at Cork, Ireland in late July. We have successfully transitioned the majority of the product previously produced at Cork to our larger dual-line plants in Europe and North America. This has increased the capacity utilization rate at our other airlaid nonwovens facilities." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Item 2.06 - Material Impairment On January 6, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our Glueckstadt, Germany facility in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we believe the commitment to discontinue production represents an indicator of impairment and have evaluated the value of the property, plant, and equipment associated with the Glueckstadt facility. Under this guidance we estimate the impairment charge will be approximately $12 million ($7 million after tax) and will be included in our financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, the closure of the Glueckstadt facility will result in the termination of approximately 100 employees. We will incur restructuring costs, including employee termination expenses, estimated to be approximately $10 million. Item 8.01 - Other Events On January 11, 2004, we issued a press release announcing the discontinuation of production at our Glueckstadt, Germany facility. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Item 9.01. - Financial Statements and Exhibits Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of our press release issued on January 11, 2005.

(NYSE:BKI) today announced that it will discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at its Glueckstadt, Germany facility in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2005. The Company will continue to meet the needs of its customers by sourcing products currently produced at Glueckstadt from its facilities in Memphis, Tennessee and Americana, Brazil. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, "Although cotton linter pulp is an important part of Buckeye's specialty pulp business, we can no longer economically justify operating this high fixed cost facility which has seen its economic position deteriorate considerably from the large rise in the Euro over the past two years. We believe we can retain most of the volume currently produced at Glueckstadt by more completely utilizing our Memphis facility, which recently has been running at about eighty percent of capacity, and bringing the Americana facility, which will have market capability by the fall of 2005, to near capacity levels on an accelerated schedule. We are confident that lower manufacturing costs at these locations will help us serve the market better and generate future growth. Transferring Glueckstadt production to other facilities will enable us to improve our operating results by about $9 million annually and reduce working capital needs by about $6 million. We expect to fully realize these benefits by calendar year 2006." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "It is extremely unfortunate that economic conditions require the closure of the Glueckstadt facility and termination of approximately 100 dedicated employees. The Company will incur restructuring costs, including employee termination expenses, estimated to be approximately $10 million. Additionally, we will include a non-cash asset impairment charge relating to the Glueckstadt facility of about $7 million after tax in our October-December 2004 financial results." Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for January 12, 2005 9:30 a.m. CST to further discuss the Glueckstadt plant closure. All interested parties are invited to dial in at 800-289-0518 (U.S.) or 913-981-5532 (International). Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods. Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, financing, markets, products, services and prices, and other factors.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Reports October-December Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 26, 2005--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $2.9 million after tax (8 cents per share) in the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The Company results include $7.4 million after tax in impairment costs relating to the previously announced closure of its facility in Glueckstadt, Germany and a $4.7 million after tax gain from the sale of its building and equipment in Cork, Ireland. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company's restated net income was a loss of $15.2 million after tax (minus 41 cents per share), which included refinancing, restructuring, and impairment costs of $3.8 million after tax. Excluding the impact of the Cork building sale, the Glueckstadt impairment charge and restructuring costs, the Company earned $5.9 million after tax (16 cents per share) in October-December 2004. This represents an improvement of $17.3 million after tax versus the loss of $11.4 million after tax (minus 31 cents per share), excluding refinancing, restructuring, and impairment costs in the same period a year ago. Last year's results also include a $5.5 million after tax expense for the Company's first in five years major planned maintenance outage at its Foley, Florida facility. Net sales for the October-December quarter were $180.6 million, 12.7% above the $160.3 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman David B. Ferraro commented, "We are pleased that both our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials achieved robust sales growth during October-December. We are also pleased that we were able to reduce our debt net of cash by $17.6 million. Our business has continued to improve." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "While the changes we have made are improving our capacity utilization and efficiency, earnings growth is being dampened by high costs for chemicals and energy, which are offsetting some of the benefit of our stronger sales." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On December 31, 2004 we had borrowing capacity of $67.3 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004 our add back was limited to $492 of the $2,073 of restructuring expense recorded during that quarter. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred after June 30, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. (d) Amounts have been restated from those previously reported based on the cumulative effect of change in accounting. CONTACT: Buckeye Technologies Inc.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces January-March Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2005--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $4.1 million after tax (11 cents per share) in the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The Company's results include $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) in restructuring costs associated with the previously announced plan to close the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant at the end of 2005, early extinguishment of debt, and fees related to amending the Company's credit facilities. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company incurred a loss of $27.5 million after tax (74 cents per share) which included $28.6 million after tax in restructuring and impairment costs, primarily relating to the closure of its Cork, Ireland nonwovens manufacturing facility. Excluding restructuring, impairment, and financing charges in both years, the Company earned $4.9 million after tax (13 cents per share) in January-March 2005 which compares with $1.1 million after tax (3 cents per share) in January-March 2004. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $180.9 million, 5% above the $172.8 million in the same quarter in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "Although we did experience some slowdown in sales of nonwoven materials, sales of specialty fibers continue to be strong. Additionally, we are making good progress in implementing our plan to transfer production of grades currently manufactured at the Glueckstadt facility to our plants in the United States and Brazil when Glueckstadt ceases production at the end of calendar 2005." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "While rising costs for chemicals, energy, and other materials continue to have a negative impact on margins, we did reduce our debt net of cash by $17.2 million. We remain confident that the underlying strength of our business will lead to future earnings growth." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On March 31, 2005 we had borrowing capacity of $66.1 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004 our add back was limited to $492 of the $2,073 of restructuring expense recorded during that quarter. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million. CONTACT: Buckeye Technologies Inc.

SECTION 1. REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On June 7, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Buckeye Technologies Inc. approved the acceleration of vesting of all out-of-the-money unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of Buckeye Technologies Inc. that would still be unvested at June 30, 2005. These options were previously awarded to non-employee directors, executive officers, and other employees under the Company's Amended and Restated 1995 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan for Management Employees and the Company's Amended and Restated Formula Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Options to purchase 898,150 shares of common stock are subject to this acceleration. The closing price of Buckeye Technologies stock on June 7, 2005 was $8.32. The following table summarizes the options subject to acceleration: The acceleration of vesting of these out-of-the money options is being undertaken primarily to eliminate any future compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its income statement with respect to these options with the implementation of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) statement "Share-Based Payment" (FAS 123R) effective July 1, 2005. We estimate this compensation expense, before tax, would total $5.2 million (approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2006, $1.5 million in fiscal 2007, $0.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2009) based on value calculations using the Black-Scholes methodology. The text of a press release dated June 8, 2005 announcing the above-described option acceleration is set forth as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. Forward Looking Statement Certain statements in this Report on Form 8-K that are not strictly historical statements constitute forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from what is expressed in those forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those related to the Company's expectations regarding the impact of the accelerated vesting of options on its financial results in future periods. Important factors that may affect such forward-looking statements include, without limitation: the possibility that FASB Statement No. 123R ("FAS 123R") could be changed, amended or interpreted in a manner that would change the Company's current assessment of the effects of the adoption of FAS 123R on the acceleration of the vesting of stock options and the final results of the closing of the Company's books for future financial periods; as well as other risks detailed in Buckeye Technologies Inc.'s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2004 and on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2004, December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005.

(NYSE: BKI) today announced that it has accelerated the vesting of certain unvested "out-of-the-money" stock options previously awarded to directors, officers, and employees. The effective date of the acceleration is June 7, 2005. Outstanding unvested options that are "in-the-money" will not be subject to acceleration and will continue to vest on the Company's normal schedule. Options to purchase 898,150 shares of Buckeye common stock, which would otherwise have vested over the next four years, will become fully vested, including 422,550 options held by executive officers, 70,000 options held by non-employee directors and 405,600 options held by other employees. These options represent about 19% of the total options outstanding. The total weighted average exercise price per share is $11.00. The closing price of Buckeye Technologies stock on June 7, 2005 was $8.32. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "The Company's decision to accelerate the vesting of these `out-of-the-money' options is in recognition of the issuance of FAS 123(R). Accelerating the vesting of these options will result in the Company not being required to recognize compensation expense before tax of approximately $2.2 million associated with these options in fiscal 2006 and another $3.0 million in future periods. We believe this is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Reports Fourth Quarter Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 2, 2005--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $8.7 million after tax ($0.23 per share) in the quarter ended June 30, 2005. The Company's results include a $5.5 million tax benefit ($0.15 per share) relating to the previously announced favorable tax ruling in connection with its investment in its discontinued facility at Cork, Ireland and $1.7 million after tax ($0.05 cents per share) in restructuring and impairment charges related to its previously announced plan to close the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant at the end of calendar 2005. During the same quarter of the prior year the Company earned $1.4 million after tax ($0.04 cents per share) which included $2.0 million ($0.05 per share) after tax in restructuring and impairment charges primarily related to the closure of its facilities in Cork, Ireland and Lumberton, North Carolina. During fiscal year 2005, the Company earned $20.1 million after tax ($0.53 per share), including impairment, restructuring, financing costs, special asset sales, and the favorable tax ruling which netted to a profit increase of $0.3 million after tax. This compares to a loss of $38.2 million after tax ($1.03 per share) in fiscal year 2004 which included impairment, restructuring, and refinancing expenses of $36.6 million after tax ($0.99 per share). Net sales for the April-June quarter were $183.9 million, 9.5% above the $168.0 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for fiscal 2005 were $712.8 million, 8.5% above the $656.9 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "Fiscal year 2005 was a year of improvement and recovery for Buckeye. We made considerable progress in restoring the Company's profitability and strengthened our balance sheet although our financial results still fell short of where we would like them to be." Mr. Ferraro went on to say, "Cash flow in fiscal 2005 was particularly encouraging. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $78.6 million, which enabled us to reduce the debt on our balance sheet by $67.1 million (from $604.0 million to $536.9 million). We remain committed to achieving further debt reduction in fiscal 2006 and beyond." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On June 30, 2005 we had borrowing capacity of $65.6 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of losses on disposal of assets to $1.0 million per fiscal year. Since we exceeded the $1.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2005 our add back was limited to $341 of the $1,276 of losses recorded during the quarter. (d) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004 our add back was limited to $492 of the $2,073 of restructuring expense recorded during that quarter. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces July-September Earnings Expectations MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 12, 2005--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects already high costs, exacerbated by the impact of Hurricane Katrina, will reduce the Company's earnings for the quarter ending September 30, 2005 to about 5 to 7 cents per share, excluding restructuring and early debt extinguishment costs. While none of the Company's operations suffered serious damage from Hurricane Katrina, the disruptions caused by the storm and the impact of high material and energy costs are expected to result in Buckeye's earnings falling below the 14 cents per share, excluding restructuring costs, earned in the July-September quarter of the previous year. Analysts expected earnings for the current quarter, excluding restructuring and early debt extinguishment costs, to be within the range of 9 to 13 cents per share. The Company expects that sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2005 will be at or above the level achieved in the year ago quarter. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "Although the high costs we are experiencing and the disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina are disappointing, we do not anticipate that they will have a long-term negative effect on our business. We will be repricing many annual contracts at the beginning of the calendar year and have confidence that we will reestablish margin growth during calendar year 2006." Buckeye plans to announce its July-September 2005 quarterly earnings on October 24, 2005 and has scheduled a conference call at 10:30 EST, Tuesday, October 25, 2005 to further discuss its quarterly results.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces First Quarter Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2005--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a net loss of $0.3 million after tax in the quarter ended September 30, 2005. The Company's results include $1.3 million after tax in early extinguishment of debt costs and restructuring expenses associated with the previously announced plan to close the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant at the end of calendar year 2005. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company earned $4.4 million after tax which included $0.8 million after tax in restructuring costs primarily related to the closure of its Cork, Ireland nonwovens manufacturing facility. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $165.5 million, 1% below the $167.3 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman David B. Ferraro commented, "The just completed quarter was a very difficult one for Buckeye. Hurricane Katrina, followed by Hurricane Rita, drove already high energy and chemical costs even higher and forced transportation providers to increase their pricing. Our energy, chemical, and transportation costs were about $8 million more in the quarter ending September 30, 2005 than they were in the same period of the prior year." Mr. Ferraro went on to say, "In addition to these high costs, transportation disruptions and lower sales of fluff pulp resulted in our revenue being slightly below the previous year. As a result of the extraordinary and unprecedented high costs, we have implemented price surcharges of up to 5% on most products effective October 1st. We are also working to mitigate rising costs and believe that the combination of cost savings, the price surcharges and volume growth in the seasonally stronger second quarter will enable us to be profitable in October-December 2005." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Prior year calculations have been restated to conform with the current credit facility definition. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On September 30, 2005 we had borrowing capacity of $42.5 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of losses on disposal of assets to $1.0 million per year. Since we exceeded the $1.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2005 our add back was limited to $341 of the $1,276 of losses recorded during the quarter. (d) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Since we exceeded the $6.0 million threshold during the three months ended June 30, 2004, restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Reports October-December Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 24, 2006--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced it earned $1.9 million after tax (5 cents per share) in the quarter ended December 31, 2005. The Company's results include $0.7 million after tax in restructuring expenses associated with the closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant. The Glueckstadt manufacturing facility ceased production in December. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company earned $2.9 million after tax, which included $6.6 million after tax in restructuring and impairment costs and a $4.7 million after tax gain from the sale of a building and equipment located at Cork, Ireland. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $188.3 million, 4% above the $180.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, "Business conditions continued to be very challenging during October-December. While we are pleased that we achieved sales growth, continuing high costs for chemicals, energy, and transportation combined with startup expenses related to installing market pulp capability at our Americana, Brazil facility depressed earnings." Mr. Ferraro went on to say, "Although high energy related costs and startup expenses at the Americana facility will continue to impact us in fiscal year 2006, product price increases we have implemented and the fact that we have essentially completed our capital expenditures related to converting Americana give us optimism that we will begin to restore margins and reduce our debt during the balance of the fiscal year." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On December 31, 2005 we had borrowing capacity of $22.7 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million.

BUCKEYE EXPECTS TO REPORT BREAKEVEN
 
 
 
RESULTS FOR THE JANUARY-MARCH QUARTER
MEMPHIS, TN March 24, 2006
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects its profitability for the January-March quarter will be near breakeven. This would be significantly below the $4.1 million (11 cents per share) earned in January-March 2005.
The Company had previously indicated that it expected January-March earnings to be slightly better than the $1.9MM (5 cents per share) earned in October-December 2005. We now believe we will fall short of that level. Manufacturing difficulties at our large wood pulp mill in Florida related to the startup of new equipment and transportation issues which reduced revenue have negatively impacted our business.
The financial shortfall versus the comparable period last year is due to the following:
These negative factors will more than offset the improvement the Company is achieving in its high-end specialty fibers and nonwoven materials.
Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, stated, While we are disappointed in our financial results, we believe the manufacturing difficulties that plagued us this quarter are behind us. We are pleased with the facility we have constructed in Brazil and believe it will be a significant profit contributor to the Company in the future. We are also pleased with our ability to maintain our margins in our high-end specialty fibers in the face of the extraordinary energy driven cost increases we have incurred.
Buckeye plans to announce its January-March 2006 earnings on April 25, 2006 and has scheduled a conference call at 10:30 EST, Wednesday, April 26, 2006 to discuss its quarterly results.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces January-March Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2006--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it incurred a net loss of $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) in the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The Company's results include $1.1 million after tax (3 cents per share) in restructuring and impairment expenses associated with the closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp mill at the end of calendar year 2005. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company earned $4.1 million after tax (11 cents per share) which included $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) in restructuring costs, early extinguishment of debt expenses, and fees related to amending the Company's credit facilities. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $181.4 million, slightly above the $180.9 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, David B. Ferraro, commented, "The combination of startup expenses at the Company's recently upgraded cotton cellulose manufacturing facility in Americana, Brazil and our inability to raise fluff pulp prices to cover extraordinarily high energy related costs resulted in our poor profit performance. On the positive side, the company was able to increase prices to offset increased costs in its high end specialty fibers and nonwovens materials and to reduce debt by about $10 million." Mr. Ferraro further stated, "With our Americana facility beginning to produce saleable products, we are optimistic that the Company's financial results will improve during April-June. The reduction in startup expense and operational improvement driven by our Lean Enterprise initiative should enable us to begin to rebuild margins and accelerate the pace of debt reduction." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods. Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, financing, markets, products, services and prices, and other factors.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On March 31, 2006 we had borrowing capacity of $31.7 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million. CONTACT: Buckeye Technologies Inc.

BUCKEYE EXPECTS SMALL IMPROVEMENT FOR APRIL-JUNE QUARTER
MEMPHIS, TN July 17, 2006
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects its profitability for the April-June quarter will be slightly above the level achieved in January-March 2006.
The Company anticipates it will report revenue growth in the mid-single digits versus both the preceding quarter and the year ago quarter. Buckeyes new initiatives in the building products industry (UltraFiber 500) and its recently upgraded specialty cellulose facility at Americana, Brazil have contributed to the revenue growth. Additionally, net debt was reduced by $30.9 million to $510.9 million.
Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe commented, While we are pleased that we are building sales for both UltraFiber 500 and at our Americana facility, we are disappointed that the ramp-up at Americana did not meet our expectations for the quarter. Additionally, high manufacturing costs at our wood facility in Florida had a negative impact on earnings. As we begin our fiscal year 2007, our priorities are to turn the higher revenues from new initiatives into improved earnings and to reduce costs across the company.
Buckeye plans to announce its fiscal year 2006 and April-June results on August 8, 2006 and has scheduled a conference call at 10:30 a.m. EST, Wednesday, August 9, 2006 to discuss these.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Reports Fourth Quarter Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 8, 2006--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $1.2 million after tax ($.03 per share) in the quarter ended June 30, 2006. The Company's results included a $0.8 million tax benefit ($.02 per share) relating to a reduction in Canadian federal and provincial tax rates and restructuring and impairment expenses of $0.5 million after tax ($.01 per share) primarily associated with equipment sales at the Company's closed operations in Lumberton, North Carolina and Glueckstadt, Germany. During the same quarter of the prior year the Company earned $8.8 million after tax ($.23 per share) which included a $5.5 million tax benefit ($.15 per share) and $1.7 million after tax ($.05 per share) in restructuring and impairment expenses related to the announced closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant. During fiscal year 2006, the Company earned $2.0 million after tax ($.05 per share) including restructuring and impairment expenses of $3.6 million after tax ($.10 per share). This compares to fiscal year 2005 earnings of $20.2 million after tax ($.54 per share) including restructuring, impairment, financing costs, special asset sales and favorable tax ruling which netted a profit increase of $0.3 million after tax. Net sales for the April-June quarter were $193.4 million, 5% above the $183.9 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for fiscal year 2006 were $728.5 million, 2% above the $712.8 million achieved in the prior year. Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe said, "Fiscal year 2006 was highlighted by the completion of the restructuring programs that began three years ago. The closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton cellulose pulp plant and the start of market pulp production at our Americana, Brazil cotton cellulose pulp plant completed the planned consolidation necessary to improve our cost structure. While the Americana ramp-up has been slower than we expected, the facility is building revenue and we expect to improve financial performance in fiscal 2007. With the restructuring program completed, we are positioned for growth in fiscal year 2007." Mr. Crowe went on to say, "During fiscal year 2006 high energy, chemical, and transportation costs coupled with the Americana startup compressed our margins. However, cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year was encouraging. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2006 totaled $58.7 million which enabled us to complete the investment in Americana and reduce debt by $16 million (from $537 million to $521 million). We intend to continue to reduce debt in fiscal 2007." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On June 30, 2006 we had borrowing capacity of $62.6 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility. (c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2004, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed $6.0 million. Restructuring charges of $1,559 incurred between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 are not added back to Adjusted EBITDA. We amended our credit facility on March 15, 2005. The amended credit facility provides for adding back restructuring charges subsequent to December 31, 2004 not to exceed $12.0 million. CONTACT: Buckeye Technologies Inc.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 8, 2006, upon recommendation of its Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of Buckeye Technologies Inc. (Buckeye) authorized entering into change in control agreements with Buckeyes Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice Presidents. The form of change in control agreement provides for (1) a lump sum severance payment, (2) continued medical coverage and (3) accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted stock and option awards upon the executives termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason within two years after a change in control of Buckeye (as each of these terms are defined in the change in control agreements). For the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, the severance payment will be equal to three times the executives highest base salary and bonus in the three years preceding termination, and medical coverage will be continued for three years following the executives termination. For a Senior Vice President, the severance payment will be equal to two times the executives highest base salary and bonus in the three years preceding termination, and medical coverage will be continued for two years following the executives termination. If the amount of the foregoing payments would cause an executive to become subject to the golden parachute excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments will be reduced so that the executive would not be subject to an excise tax.
For purposes of the agreements,
 
 
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of change in control agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Item 1.10 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Buckeye has an At-Risk Compensation program for executive officers and certain other employees.  In connection with the At-Risk Compensation program for the year ended June 30, 2006, Buckeyes Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors made the following compensation decisions on August 8, 2006:
1.  Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe will be awarded a cash bonus of $15,000.
2.  President and Chief Operating Officer Kristopher J. Matula will be awarded a cash bonus of $10,000.

3.1.3.
  
Non-Competition
. The Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and accordingly agrees as follows:
 
3.1.3.1.
  
For a period ending on the expiration of one year following the Executives termination of employment by the Company for Cause or the Executives voluntary termination of employment without Good Reason, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, (i) engage in any business for the Executives own account that competes with the business of the Company, (ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to, any person engaged in any business that competes with the business of the Company, (iii) acquire a financial interest in, or otherwise become actively involved with, any person engaged in any business that competes with the business of the Company, directly or indirectly, as an individual, partner, shareholder, officer, director, principal, agent, trustee or consultant, or (iv) interfere with business relationships (whether formed before or after the Effective Date) between the Company or any of its affiliates that are engaged in a business similar to the business of the Company (the Company Affiliates) and customers or suppliers of the Company or the Company Affiliates.

The Executive further agrees that he shall not, in any equity proceeding relating to the enforcement of the terms of this Section 3.1, raise the defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law.
 
3.1.5.
  
Special Severability
. The terms and provisions of this Section 3.1 are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall thereby be affected. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the potential restrictions on the Executives future employment imposed by this Section 3.1 be reasonable in both duration and geographic scope and in all other respects. If for any reason any court of competent jurisdiction shall find any provisions of this Section 3.1 unreasonable in duration or geographic scope or otherwise, the Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions and prohibitions contained herein shall be effective to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
 
4.
  
Severance Payments
 
4.1.
  
Severance.

In addition, the Executives employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason if (1) (a) the Executive reasonably demonstrates that the Executives employment was terminated without Cause prior to a Change in Control (I) at the request of a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company the consummation of which will constitute a Change in Control (or who has taken other steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control) or (II) otherwise in connection with, as a result of or in anticipation of a Change in Control, or (b) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason prior to a Change in Control and the Executive reasonably demonstrates that the circumstance(s) or event(s) which constitute such Good Reason occurred (I) at the request of such Person or (II) otherwise in connection with, as a result of or in anticipation of a Change in Control, and (2) such Change in Control actually occurs. The Executives right to terminate the Executives employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the Executives incapacity due to physical or mental illness. The Executives continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any act or failure to act constituting Good Reason hereunder. In the event of disability or death of the Executive after the Date of Termination in respect of any termination without Cause or any termination for Good Reason, payments and benefits shall be made to the Executive, or the Executives beneficiaries or legal representative, as the case may be.

provided
,
however
, that the continued coverage period hereunder shall be deemed to constitute a portion of the Executives entitlement to COBRA benefits as a result of his termination of employment. Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 4.1.2 shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by or made available to the Executive without cost during such period following the Executives termination of employment (and any such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported to the Company by the Executive).
 
4.1.3.
  
Immediate vesting and/or exercisability of all outstanding equity based awards.
 
4.2.
  
Excise Tax Limitation.

All determinations to be made with respect to such nondeductibility and this Section 4.2 generally shall be made by the Company in good faith based on the written advice of the Companys regular independent certified public accountants and/or regular outside legal counsel (and/or such other professionals as the Company deems appropriate), and all such determinations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Company and the Executive.
 
5.

For purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of Termination shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executives employment with the Company under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board, which was called and held for the purpose of considering such termination (which meeting may be a regular meeting of the Board where prior notice of consideration of such termination is given to members of the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive engaged in conduct set forth in the definition of Cause herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. For purposes of this Agreement, any purported termination not effected in accordance with this Section 5.1 shall not be considered effective.

6.2.
  
Binding Agreement.

REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS
Item 1.01
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 11, 2006, Buckeye Technologies, Inc. ("Buckeye") adopted a Retirement Replacement Plan to recognize the years of professional service of certain officers and key employees who joined Buckeye mid-career by providing these individuals with benefits based on prior service. This Retirement Replacement Plan replaces a similar deferred compensation plan which Buckeye terminated in December 2004.
 
Under the Retirement Replacement Plan, Buckeye's Chief Executive Officer, President and other key employees designated by the Chief Executive Officer are eligible to receive a cash payment each fiscal year equal to the difference between (A) the employer contribution that would have been made to his or her account under Buckeye's qualified retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") for the fiscal year had he or she been credited with an additional number of years of service as determined by (1) the Compensation Committee in the case of the Chief Executive Officer and the President, and (2) by the Chief Executive Officer in the case of any other employee, and (B) the employer contribution that was actually credited to his or her account under the Retirement Plan for such fiscal year. (An employee is entitled to an employer contribution equal to 1% of pay plus 1/2% of pay for each year of service with Buckeye, up to a maximum of 11% of pay.)
 
Cash payments under the Retirement Replacement Plan may not exceed 4% of pay in any fiscal year and will be made after the end of the applicable fiscal year. The amount of the cash payment made under the Retirement Replacement Plan plus the employer contribution actually credited to the employee's account under the Retirement Plan cannot exceed 11% of pay in any fiscal year. The Retirement Replacement Plan is effective beginning with the 2006 fiscal year.

BUCKEYE EXPECTS IMPROVEMENT FOR JULY-SEPTEMBER QUARTER
 
Memphis, TN October 11, 2006 - Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects its profitability for the July-September quarter to be about 10 cents per share.
 
 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Our first quarter net sales were up 16% compared to the same period last year. The improvement is a combination of good volume, higher prices and better mix. Demand for our specialty wood and cotton products, nonwoven materials and fluff pulp were all strong during the quarter.
 
 
Buckeye plans to announce its July-September results on October 24, 2006 and has scheduled a conference call at 11 a.m. EST, Wednesday, October 25, 2006 to discuss first quarter results.
 
 
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Certain statements contained in this press release contain forward-looking statements regarding Buckeye Technologies Inc.'s operations, economic performance and financial condition.  Although Buckeye believes that the expectations reflected in such statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct as a result of many factors, including those described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 1, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces July-September Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2006--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $3.8 million after tax (10 cents per share) in the quarter ended September 30, 2006. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company incurred a net loss of $0.3 million after tax (1 cent per share) which included $1.2 million after tax (3 cents per share) in restructuring expenses associated with last year's closure of our Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $191.4 million, 16% above the $165.5 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Buckeye Chairman, John B. Crowe, commented, "Our sales of nonwoven materials and specialty fibers products were strong during the quarter as we continued to see market conditions like we did in the April-June quarter. The biggest driver of the increase in sales over a weak July-September quarter last year was higher shipment volume, but our sales also benefited from increased pricing and improved shipment mix. Particularly pleasing were the record sales, volumes and operating income delivered by our nonwovens segment." Mr. Crowe went on to say, "Strong operating results, working capital reduction and low capital spending allowed us to reduce debt by $24 million during the quarter. We now have less than $500 million of debt on the balance sheet, which is a milestone for us." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On September 30, 2006 we had borrowing capacity of $65.1 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces October - December Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 30, 2007--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $3.8 million after tax (10 cents per share) in the quarter ended December 31, 2006. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company earned $1.9 million after tax (5 cents per share) which included $0.7 million after tax in restructuring expenses associated with last year's closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $184.7 million, 2% lower than $188.3 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 were $376.1 million, 6% higher than net sales of $353.7 million for the same period last year. Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe commented, "Demand for our products is strong and we have implemented price increases in January. Operational issues early in the October-December quarter at our Florida wood specialty fibers facility limited our sales. With low inventories, our sales are closely matched to production. The Florida facility has returned to full production rates. Going forward our focus on operational reliability will help maximize sales." Mr. Crowe went on to say, "Continued strong cash flow generation enabled us to reduce debt by $13 million during the quarter even with two large semi-annual bond interest payments, our annual employee retirement plan contribution and our annual Florida property tax payment." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). On December 31, 2006 we had borrowing capacity of $63.5 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces January-March Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2007--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $6.6 million after tax (17 cents per share) in the quarter ended March 31, 2007. This included $0.8 million after tax in restructuring expenses associated with consolidations made in our European Sales Offices, Product and Market Development, and corporate overhead. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Company lost $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) which included $1.1 million after tax in restructuring and impairment expenses associated with the closure of the Glueckstadt, Germany cotton linter pulp plant in December, 2005. Net sales in the just completed quarter were $193 million, 6% higher than $181 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 were $569 million, also 6% higher than net sales of $535 million for the same period last year. Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe commented, "Demand for our products continues to be strong, and our operations are responding to the challenge of matching production and sales. Good cash flow generation enabled us to reduce debt by $13 million during the quarter." Mr. Crowe went on to say, "The consolidations in our European Sales Offices, Product and Market Development and corporate overhead complement the operations consolidations we completed during the last several years and will provide annual savings of over $2 million." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: interest income, cumulative effect of changes in accounting, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). c) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of losses on disposal of assets to $1.0 million for any 12 month period. Since we exceeded the $1.0 million threshold during the three months ended March 31, 2007, our add back was limited to $423 of the $486 of losses recorded during the quarter. d) The definition of Adjusted EBITDA limits the add back of restructuring charges to costs incurred from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. Therefore, restructuring charges of $1,201 incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2007 have not been added back. On March 31, 2007 we had borrowing capacity of $61.5 million on the revolving credit facility. The portion of this amount that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility.

BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES ENERGY SAVINGS PROJECT
MEMPHIS, TN May 8, 2007
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that its Board of Directors approved $4.5 million in capital spending to fund the first of a series of energy related projects that will allow Buckeyes wood cellulose plant in Perry, Florida to become increasingly independent from fossil fuels for its energy needs. The projects will result in approximately 92% of the plants energy coming from renewable or green energy sources in
the future.
The cost of the entire project is expected to total $43 million and includes the installation of a condensing turbine and upgrades to two existing recovery boilers and related systems. The initial spending will support installation of the condensing turbine with a total cost of $14 million. Project work will begin immediately, and the total project will take several years to complete. Once completed, this green energy initiative is expected to replace the need for the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of oil per year and increases electrical generating capability to over 50 megawatts.
In addition to reducing the Foley plants dependence on fossil fuel, we anticipate these projects will result in further improvements to air quality, reducing sulfur air emissions by 93% and volatile organic compound emissions by 42%.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

BUCKEYE ESTABLISHES $200 MILLION SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY
 Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) announced today that it has established a new $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility.  The maturity date on the new revolver is July 2012, and the facility includes an increase option for an additional $50 million.  This facility amends and restates the Companys existing credit facility, which consisted at the closing date of an undrawn $70 million revolver and a $30 million balance on an original $150 million term loan.  The Company plans to use the proceeds from this facility to refinance its existing senior credit facilities, to refinance up to $20 million of its 8.0% senior subordinated notes having a maturity date of October 2010, to refinance the remaining $60 million of its 9.25% senior subordinated notes in September 2007 (one year ahead of maturity), and for general corporate purposes.  The Company expects to reduce interest expense by about $2 million per year on a going basis as a result of this refinancing.
MEMPHIS, TN July 25, 2007
Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe commented, Over the past 5 years, we have made tremendous progress in reducing our debt.  This new facility allows us to take advantage of our improved credit position and the favorable market conditions to reduce our interest costs and achieve more operating flexibility than we had under our existing credit facility.  In addition, this new facility gives us the ability to continue our debt reduction while maintaining sufficient operating liquidity to support our business.  We appreciate the leadership provided by Bank of America as lead arranger for this facility.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

BUCKEYE ANTICIPATES IMPROVEMENT IN APRIL-JUNE QUARTER RESULTS
 
 
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects its profitability for the April-June quarter to be in the range of 34-36 cents per share compared to 3 cents per share in the same quarter of the previous year.
MEMPHIS, TN July 25, 2007
 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John B. Crowe said, Our fourth quarter net sales were up 3.5% compared to a good period last year.  Demand for our specialty wood and cotton products, nonwoven materials and fluff pulp were all strong in the quarter.  The majority of the earnings improvement is due to a combination of higher prices, better mix and cost reductions.  The quarter also benefited from income associated with a water conservation partnership (3 cents per share) and adjustments to our tax valuation allowance relating to state income taxes (6 cents per share).
 
Buckeye plans to announce April-June and fiscal 2007 results on August 1, 2007 and has scheduled a conference call at 10:30 a.m. ET, Wednesday, August 8, 2007 to discuss fourth quarter and annual results.

Exhibit 99.1 Buckeye Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 1, 2007--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it earned $15.9 million after tax ($.41 per share) in the quarter ended June 30, 2007. The Company's results included a $2.0 million pre-tax benefit from a water conservation partnership payment, a $2.1 million pre-tax benefit from reversal of accrued interest related to cancellation of a contingent note owed to Stac-Pac Technologies Inc., and a $3.3 million tax benefit from adjustments relating to federal and state valuation allowances and credits. The combined benefit of these three items on our Q4 earnings was $.15 per share. During the same quarter of the prior year the Company earned $1.2 million after tax ($.03 per share) which included a $0.8 million tax benefit ($.02 per share) related to a reduction in Canadian federal and provincial tax rates and restructuring and impairment expenses of $0.5 million after tax ($.01 per share) primarily associated with equipment sales at the closed operations in Lumberton, North Carolina and Glueckstadt, Germany. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company earned $30.1 million after tax ($.79 per share) which included the benefit of the $5.7 million after tax ($.15 per share) discussed above and restructuring charges of $0.8 million after tax ($.02 per share). This compares to fiscal year 2006 earnings of $2.0 million after tax ($.05 per share), including restructuring and impairment expenses of $3.6 million after tax ($.10 per share). Net sales for the April-June quarter were $200 million, 3.5% above the $193 million achieved in the same quarter of the prior year. Net sales for fiscal year 2007 were $769 million, 5.6% above the $728 million achieved in the prior year. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, "We are pleased with the improved results, both for the quarter and fiscal year. We credit the improved earnings to strong demand across all of our businesses and to the combination of higher prices, better mix and cost reductions. Reduced costs and higher volumes at our Americana plant also contributed to improved earnings, both for the quarter and total year. Our Nonwoven materials segment sales and earnings were strong for the total year, but even though sales were higher, operating income for the quarter was down compared to the January - March quarter due to higher corporate SRA allocations and special maintenance items. We continue to generate strong cash flow and we lowered our debt during the year by $76 million (from $521 million to $445 million), which includes the cancellation of the $5.0 million Stac-Pac note." Mr. Crowe went on to say, "With the anticipated improved fourth quarter results, we provided an earnings alert on July 25. Today we are releasing our results ahead of schedule and we will discuss fourth quarter and annual results at our conference call scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern, Wednesday, August 8, 2007 following a review of our results with the Board of Directors at the previously scheduled August 7 meeting. We appreciate your understanding for the delay between today's announcement and our conference call." Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: asset impairment charges, non-cash charges, restructuring charges and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our new US revolving credit facility, established on July 25, 2007, and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.).

BUCKEYE ANTICIPATES IMPROVEMENT IN JULY-SEPTEMBER QUARTER RESULTS
 
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it expects its profitability for the July-September quarter to be in the range of 32-35 cents per share including a $2.2 million (6 cents per share) one-time favorable tax help related to the recently enacted reduction in Germanys corporate tax rate.
MEMPHIS, TN October 12, 2007
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John B. Crowe said, Our first quarter net sales were up 3% compared to the same period last year.  The earnings improvement is a combination of higher prices, better mix and cost control.  Excluding the one-time tax help (6 cents per share), operating earnings are anticipated to be in the range of 26-29 cents per share.  Operating earnings performance improved over the AprilJune quarter even with lower sales volume due to scheduled maintenance during the just completed quarter.  Demand for our specialty wood and cotton products, nonwoven materials and fluff pulp was strong in the quarter.  Nonwovens shipments were especially strong with net sales up 10% compared to the same period last year.
Buckeye plans to announce July-September results on October 22, 2007 and has scheduled a conference call at 3:00 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 23, 2007 to discuss first quarter performance.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: asset impairment charges, non-cash charges, restructuring charges prior to July 1, 2007 and other (gains) losses. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.).

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John B. Crowe said, We had another strong quarter. Second quarter net sales were up 14% compared to the same period last year. The earnings improvement is a combination of higher pricing, higher wood volume and cost control. Compared to our first quarter, operating earnings performance was better due to high operations reliability and higher wood specialty shipments.  While this quarters earnings performance will be difficult to repeat, we do anticipate strong performance in the January-March quarter 2008.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, Today we are informing our employees at our Delta airlaid facility near Vancouver, British Columbia that we will be reducing the shifts from seven to five resulting in a reduction of 20-25 employees.  The reduction will be completed this quarter and is the result of the loss of a significant volume of business for that facility following negotiations with a long time customer.  The strong Canadian dollar and the high transportation cost from Deltas location were key factors in not being able to meet the pricing requirements of our customer at an acceptable margin.  Despite this reduction in business, the demand for our airlaid nonwoven products remains solid, and we are committed to re-establishing growth and improving the financial performance of this business.
 
Buckeye plans to announce October-December results on January 29, 2008 and has scheduled a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT, Wednesday, January 30, 2008 to discuss second quarter performance.  Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (877) 852-6579 within the United States.  International callers should dial (719) 325-4823.

Buckeye Announces October-December Quarter Results
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced earnings for the October-December quarter of 35 cents per share. This compares to earnings for the same period last year of 10 cents per share.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We had an exceptional quarter. Second quarter net sales were up 14% compared to the same period last year. Sales of $211 million are our highest revenue quarter ever. The earnings improvement is a combination of higher pricing, higher specialty wood volume and cost control.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, We are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date revenue and income growth. Our markets remain solid and we will benefit from price increases that we implemented in January. In the current quarter, we anticipate lower nonwovens production and revenue due to our previously announced volume reduction from our Delta nonwovens facility. Additionally, we expect higher manufacturing costs at our Florida specialty wood facility due to planned maintenance inspections. While the just completed quarters earnings performance will be difficult to repeat, we do anticipate strong performance in the January-March quarter 2008.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EST, Wednesday, January 30, 2008 to discuss second quarter performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (877) 852-6579 within the United States. International callers should dial (719) 325-4823.

Buckeye Announces January-March Quarter Results
Earnings Increase 55% to $0.26 Per Diluted Share
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced earnings for the January-March quarter of 26 cents per share compared to 17 cents per share in the year ago quarter. These results include a $0.8 million (2 cents per share) tax benefit related to the identification of additional R&D tax credits. Earnings for the prior year period included $0.8 million after tax (2 cents per share) in restructuring expenses associated with consolidations made in our European Sales Offices, Product and Market Development, and corporate overhead.
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 5% to $201.9 million as compared to fiscal 2007 third quarter net sales of $193.0 million. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 were $610.2 million, up 7% compared to net sales of $569.1 million for the same period last year.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We had a another good quarter, with sales up 5% and earnings per share up 55% versus the same period a year ago, even though our operating performance fell short of our expectations. Unplanned maintenance outages at our Florida wood cellulose facility, delayed shipments due to ocean vessel availability issues and lower Nonwovens sales negatively impacted our results. A significant accomplishment for the quarter was the reduction of long-term debt by $18.6 million during the quarter to $394.5 million.
Mr. Crowe added, We have recently replaced a sizeable portion of the nonwovens business that we lost at the beginning of January, and we expect Nonwovens sales and operating income to increase over the next several quarters. While we expect higher sales and production volumes in the April-June quarter versus the immediately preceding quarter, we anticipate that our margins will be constrained by higher input and transportation costs.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for later this morning at 11:00 a.m. EDT to discuss third quarter performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (877) 857-6176 within the United States. International callers should dial (719) 325-4826.

Buckeye Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results
Company Reports Record Net Sales for the Quarter and Fiscal Year
Fiscal Year EPS of $1.20 versus $0.79 Prior Year - up 52%
Long-Term Debt Reduced by $51 million (12%) during Past 12 Months

Quarter Results Impacted by Unplanned Downtime & Cost Inflation
MEMPHIS, TENN.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that net sales in the April-June quarter grew by 7.6% over the prior year to $215.3 million, a new sales record for the Company. Earnings for the quarter were $9.3 million after tax ($0.24 per share, compared with $15.9 million ($0.41 per share) in the prior year. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Companys results included a $2.0 million pre-tax benefit from a water conservation partnership payment, a $2.1 million pre-tax benefit from reversal of accrued interest related to cancellation of a contingent note owed to Stac-Pac Technologies Inc., and a $3.3 million tax benefit from adjustments relating to federal and state valuation allowances and credits. The combined benefit of these three items on our year ago fourth quarter earnings was $0.15 per share.
Increased selling prices across all of our businesses as compared to the year-ago quarter were sufficient to offset significantly higher raw materials, energy, chemicals and transportation costs. However, reduced production volumes due to unplanned maintenance outages at our Perry, Florida wood cellulose mill and lower Nonwovens sales were the primary drivers behind a year-over-year reduction in Operating Income of $7.1 million. Excluding reversal of the accrued Stac-Pac interest that impacted the fourth quarter of last year, our net interest expense was reduced by about $2 million compared to last year mainly due to the reduction in debt. Also, our effective tax rate of 26.5% for the quarter, while higher than last years 21.9% rate, was favorably impacted by about $1.3 million in adjustments relating to identification of additional R&D tax credits and tax planning associated with intercompany interest charges to our Brazilian subsidiary.
Net sales for the fiscal year grew 7.3% over the prior year to $825.5 million, also a new sales record for the Company. Earnings for the fiscal year were $47.1 million after tax ($1.20 per share) compared to $30.1 million after tax ($0.79 per share) in the prior year.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Fiscal year 2008 was an outstanding year for Buckeye. Building on the momentum from 2007, we achieved a variety of significant performance milestones, including our highest ever sales revenue, debt below $400 million and EPS up 52% over the prior year. Due to the unprecedented cost escalation we have experienced over the past 6 months, we have implemented additional price increases and surcharges which went into effect on July 1st. While oil and natural gas prices have moderated from recent peaks, we are still facing rising cost trends for energy, raw materials, chemicals and transportation in the July-September quarter compared to the April-June quarter.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, We continue to involve the entire organization in Lean Enterprise as a key strategy to grow our business and improve margins, and we have made progress in eliminating waste and non-value added activities. We are entering the second year of a three-year energy savings project at our wood fibers facility in Florida, which when completed will save the equivalent of over 200,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil annually and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and purchased electricity. Complementing this project are several innovative renewable energy opportunities with the potential to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels while creating additional value streams. Finally, during the past quarter we have formed a Strategic Growth Team, which includes strong outside expertise, responsible for evaluating and developing options to support our corporate objective of executing profitable growth strategies.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow morning, August 12, at 10:00 a.m. EDT to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (877) 856-1961within the United States. International callers should dial(719) 325-4808.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces July
September Quarter Results
Company Reports another Record Sales Quarter
EPS was $0.23 versus $0.34 in Year-Ago Quarter which included $0.06 Tax Benefit
Nonwovens Earnings Improve by $2.8 million versus April-June Quarter on $4.1 million (7%) Increase in Sales
Specialty Fibers Earnings Flat versus April-June Quarter
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 28, 2008--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that net sales in the July-September quarter grew by 12.1% over the prior year to $221.3 million, a new sales record for the Company. Net income for the quarter was $8.9 million ($0.23 per share), compared with $13.5 million ($0.34 per share) in the prior year. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Companys results included a $2.2 million ($0.06 per share) tax benefit related to a reduction in Germanys tax rate. Free cash flow(a) for the quarter was $11.0 million.
Income before taxes, at $14.4 million, was down $4.0 million compared to the year ago quarter as a $5.9 million decrease in operating income was partially offset by a $1.7 million reduction in interest expense. In spite of substantial selling price increases across all businesses, our gross margin has declined from 20.6% of sales in the year ago quarter to 16.0% in the quarter just completed due to rapidly escalating input costs at all of our plants and lower capacity utilization at our airlaid nonwovens plants. Compared to the April-June quarter, operating income rose $2.9 million and gross margin improved from 15.2% to 16.0%.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We are pleased with the improvement in our operating results compared to the April-June quarter, particularly with the increase in sales and earnings in our Nonwoven Materials segment. We were also able to hold operating income for our Specialty Fibers segment constant with the April-June quarter. While we only saw a small increase in fluff pulp prices during the quarter, we were able to offset escalating input costs through a combination of surcharges and selling price increases on our specialty products and improved performance at our Perry, Florida wood cellulose mill. We continued to generate strong cash flow and increased our cash balance by $8 million while slightly reducing our long-term debt during the quarter. I believe that all of our efforts in recent years to reduce debt, take out costs, improve our product mix, and put a new credit facility in place in July 2007 have positioned us well for these uncertain economic times. We will continue to focus on maintaining and improving the strength of our balance sheet, particularly in this economic environment.

BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCES SPECIALTY COTTON MARKET DOWNTIME AND REVISES OUTLOOK FOR QUARTER
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI)
MEMPHIS, TN November 25, 2008
announced today that, due to softening of demand in the markets that use its cotton specialty fibers, Buckeye will be taking market downtime at its Americana Cotton Specialty Fibers facility in Brazil and reducing production by one shift at its Memphis Cotton Specialty Fibers facility.  The key markets experiencing the weak demand are nitrates, plastics, paper and LCD grades. This will result in the Americana facility being idled for the entire month of December and the Memphis facility operating at about two-thirds capacity going forward.  Both facilities have been running below capacity due to raw material constraints for the past two years, but the December downtime and shift reduction is due to reduced demand and the economic slowdown.
Chairman and CEO John Crowe said, We are making the decision to take downtime because of the recent weak market demand for our cotton specialty fiber.  We anticipate restarting the Americana facility at the first of the year, but the timing of this is uncertain. We are focused at all of our operations on meeting our customer needs by matching production to orders and minimizing inventory.  In todays turbulent global economic environment we will remain flexible and be proactive to minimize costs by controlling working capital.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, Our performance in the current quarter is being impacted by reduced customer demand, resulting in lower production and sales volume in our Cotton Fibers Business, and from some softening in several markets in wood specialty and nowoven materials.  We continue to see strong demand in our high-end Specialty Wood business.  We expect reduced shipments to our markets to result in earnings of 12 to 15 cents per share for the October - December quarter.

The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES SPECIALTY WOOD MARKET DOWNTIME
 
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that, due to softening demand and a planned recovery boiler maintenance outage, the Companys specialty wood pulp facility in Perry, Florida would take production downtime expected to total approximately 9,000 tons during the month of December which is equivalent to 7 production days.
MEMPHIS, TN December 8, 2008
Chairman and CEO John Crowe said, We are making the decision to take downtime because of recent weak demand in some of the markets for our wood specialty fiber products and the need to perform planned maintenance work on one of our recovery boilers.  Operating our facility during a planned boiler outage increases production costs and reduces our flexibility to produce certain products.  In todays global economic environment we are focused at all of our operations on meeting our customer needs by matching production to orders, minimizing costs and controlling working capital.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, With this added downtime, we would expect our earnings to be below the previously provided range of 12 to 15 cents per share for the October-December quarter.

Due to adverse equity market conditions which have caused a decrease in current market multiples and the price of the companys stock, which is currently trading well below book value, it has been determined that an indicator of potential goodwill impairment exists for the October-December quarter. Accordingly, the Company has commenced performing an interim goodwill impairment test, and expects by the first week of February to have an indication of whether an impairment charge will be required. In the event that there is a determination that goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge, which would reduce reported net income and earnings per share for the quarter, would be required. The maximum goodwill balance that would be subject to impairment as of December 31, 2008 is $140 million.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, This has been a challenging quarter for Buckeye, as the global economic recession has reduced demand for some of our products. While demand for most of our high-end specialty wood products remains solid, demand for our specialty cotton fibers has weakened significantly. Sales of our airlaid nonwovens products were also down primarily due to customer inventory reductions and normal seasonal weakness in Europe in December. As we previously announced, we took market downtime at our Foley, Memphis and Americana plants during the quarter to match production to shipment demand. In addition to a company-wide focus on reducing costs and maintaining tight control over our working capital, we have reduced our planned capital spending for this fiscal year from $64 million to $40 million in order to accelerate debt reduction efforts. We have established a goal of paying down our debt from the current level of $391 million to $350 million by December 2009 in order to ensure that we have sufficient borrowing capacity on our $200 million revolving credit facility to pay off the $110 million in bonds which mature in October 2010 without going to the credit markets for new financing. Buckeye was well in compliance with all of its debt covenants and had $114 million in available borrowing capacity plus $8.5 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of December.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, Because of our restructuring efforts over the last few years, which included closing high cost capacity, lowering our operating costs, and reducing our debt from $700 million to under $400 million, we believe we are well positioned to deal with this economic downturn. While our visibility into future order trends at the moment is poor, we expect that the January-March quarter will show improved profitability at similar revenue levels as compared to the quarter just completed. While we expect fluff pulp prices to decline, we have instituted price increases in our high-end wood specialty markets effective January 1 and energy and transportation costs are down. Caustic prices will start to come down in February, but our average caustic cost for the quarter is still likely to be higher than it was in the October-December quarter.

SECTION 8.  OTHER EVENTS
Item 8.01.  Other Events
On March 20, 2009, Buckeye Technologies Inc. received a registration number from the internal Revenue Service registering the Companys wood cellulose manufacturing facility as an alternative fueler.
Buckeye burns alternative fuel mixtures at its Foley plant, a wood cellulose manufacturing facility located near Perry, Florida in order to produce renewable energy and help manage the Companys exposure to high energy costs.  The federal government has implemented a program that provides incentive payments under certain circumstances for the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel mixtures in lieu of fossil-based fuels.  In early February 2009, the Company filed an application with the Internal Revenue Service for certification of its eligibility to receive incentive payments for its use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures in the recovery boilers at the Foley plant.  To date, the Company has not received any incentive payments.  The Company filed today to receive payments for alternative fuel operation since February 12, 2009.
The federal regulations relating to the alternative fuels mixture incentive program are complex, and the Company is seeking further clarification prior to the recognition of any payment received for financial reporting purposes.  Based on our current understanding of the program, only the Companys Foley facility is eligible for participation in the incentive program.  The Company is continuing to evaluate our opportunities for burning alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy.  Depending on the quantity of alternative fuel mixtures burned, the federal incentive payments that may be received by the Company could be material.  At the same time, there can be no assurance that the federal incentive program for alternative fuel mixtures will continue in effect, that its provisions will not be changed in a manner that impacts the Company, the Company operations will remain qualified to receive the incentive payments, or that the Companys claims for the incentive payments will be approved and paid.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces January  March Quarter Results
Sales off 15% versus Year-Ago Quarter due to reduced demand
Net Income of $4.3 million ($0.11 per share) down 59% versus Year-Ago Quarter
Improved Earnings compared to October-December Quarter
Free Cash Flow of $12.2 million versus $14.0 million in Year-Ago Quarter
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 28, 2009--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced earnings for the January  March quarter of 11 cents per share compared to 26 cents per share in the same period last year due to reduced demand and associated production downtime in the Specialty Fibers segment resulting from the global economic downturn. This was 4 cents per share better than earnings for the October-December period excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge which reduced earnings by $3.30 per share in that quarter.
Net sales of $171.6 million for the quarter were down 15% compared to the same quarter a year ago, with sales in the Specialty Fibers segment down 18% and sales in the Nonwoven Materials segment only off 2%. Specialty Fibers sales were negatively impacted by reduced demand for cotton specialty fibers, wood specialty fibers used in automotive applications, and fluff pulp. Net sales for the quarter were down 7% compared to the October-December quarter, primarily driven by reduced sales from our Memphis cotton cellulose plant.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, While not satisfied with our overall results, we were pleased that underlying earnings improved compared to the October-December quarter in spite of a drop in sales revenue. We continued to take market downtime at our Foley, Memphis and Americana plants during the quarter to match production to shipment demand, and effective May 1, we will further reduce staffing at our Memphis cotton cellulose plant in order to match capacity to reduced demand levels for products supplied by this plant. On the average, selling prices were comparable to the preceding quarter, as the impact of the January 1 price increases on our high-end wood specialty fibers products was offset by lower prices for fluff pulp and other products. We started to see some significant reductions in raw materials, energy and transportation costs during the quarter and we believe that chemical costs peaked during the January  March quarter. Our Nonwoven materials segment also reported higher shipment volumes and improved operating income compared to the October-December quarter.
st
st
Mr. Crowe went on to say, We made progress toward our 2009 debt reduction goal, as we generated $12.2 million in free cash flow during the quarter, reduced our debt by $2.7 million and added $9.5 million to our cash balance. Also, during the month of April we have received $25.4 million in refunds related to the alternative fuels credit covering the period between February 12 and April 14. We recognized no benefit related to this credit in the January-March quarter. We continue to believe that the Company is in much better condition to weather this downturn as compared with previous downturns because of the improvements in our balance sheet and cost structure.

BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES COMMENCEMENT OF CONSENT SOLICITATION
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it has commenced a solicitation of consents (the Consent Solicitation) from holders of its outstanding $200 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes due October 1, 2013 (the 2013 Notes) to amend the indenture for the 2013 Notes.  The purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to amend certain provisions of the indenture governing the 2013 Notes to permit the redemption, repurchase or retirement of subordinated indebtedness, including the Companys senior subordinated notes due 2010, up to 16 months prior to maturity, which represents an increase of 4 months compared to the current indenture.
MEMPHIS, TN June 17, 2009
Buckeye will pay a consent fee of $650,000 in the aggregate to all consenting holders, subject to the requisite consents being validly delivered and not revoked by the holders.  The consent fee represents a portion of the estimated interest rate savings resulting from the Companys ability to redeem its 8% senior subordinated notes due October 15, 2010 promptly following receipt of the requisite consents.  Following the expiration of the Consent Solicitation, Buckeye will compute the consent fee payable for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2013 Notes for which consents are validly delivered and not revoked by multiplying 1,000 by the quotient of (a) $650,000 and (b) the total principal amount of 2013 Notes for which consents are validly delivered and not revoked.  For example, assuming consents are validly delivered and not revoked by holders representing all of the outstanding 2013 Notes, the consent fee will equal $3.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2013 Notes.  Alternatively, assuming consents are validly delivered and not revoked by holders representing $100,001,000 of the outstanding 2013 Notes, the consent fee will equal $6.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2013 Notes for which consents are validly delivered and not revoked.  No consent fee will be paid unless the requisite consents are obtained.
 
The Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 30, 2009, unless extended.  The approval of the proposed amendments requires the consent of holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2013 Notes.  The terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation are described in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated June 17, 2009, copies of which may be obtained from Global Bondholder Services Corporation.
 
Questions regarding the Consent Solicitation and requests for documentation may be directed to Global Bondholders Services Corporation, the information agent for the Consent Solicitation, at (866) 470-4300 (US toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect).
 
This announcement is not a solicitation of consents with respect to any securities.  The Consent Solicitation is being made solely by the Consent Solicitation Statement dated June 17, 2009.

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA IFAS, BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES AND MYRIANT ANNOUNCE NEXT GENERATION CELLULOSIC ETHANOL RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PLANT
 
The University of Floridas Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Buckeye Technologies Inc. and Myriant Technologies LLC (formed by BioEnergy International, LLC) have announced plans for a research and demonstration plant that will explore ways to harness byproducts from some of the most promising cellulosic ethanol techniques to make environmentally friendly versions of petroleum products.
MEMPHIS, TN June 17, 2009
-
Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI)
 
The plant is to be located at Buckeyes Perry, Fla., facility and will be built with the aid of $20 million allocated by the Florida Legislature.  The groundbreaking is planned for this fall, with an ultimate goal of proving a level of commercial viability that could lead to a full-scale biorefinery at the site.
 
The project will seek to combine several UF-developed technologies.  The plant will employ cellulosic ethanol production technology now licensed to Verenium Corp. and used in demonstration plants around the globe.
 
This will be combined with technology licensed to Myriant to make biobased chemicals with many potential applications, such as biodegradable forms of plastic.
 
Were trying to break our dependence on petroleum. Fuel is a big part of that, but its not the only part, said Lonnie Ingram, the UF distinguished professor of microbiology and cell science who led development of the technology.  Learning how to develop these valuable byproducts not only helps to make cellulosic ethanol more economically feasible, but it takes the environmental impact of cellulosic ethanol and extends it to new areas-like plastic water bottles that wont take up space in a landfill for thousands of years.
 
Cellulosic ethanol is made from the inedible portions of plants and, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 86 percent compared with gasoline. Biobased chemicals, such as plastics, derived from cellulosic feedstocks might produce even greater savings.
 
 
 
 
Cellulosic ethanol and its associated chemicals can also be adapted to use whatever feedstock is available nearby, reducing transportation costs.  The new plant will experiment with a wide variety of potential feedstocks such as forest products, sugarcane, sugar processing byproducts and many others.
 
Headquartered in Memphis, Tenn., Buckeye is a leading producer of cellulose-based specialty products. The company owns and operates a wood cellulose plant in Perry in addition to cotton cellulose manufacturing operations in Memphis and Americana, Brazil.
 
Buckeye Chairman and CEO John Crowe said the research plant partnership is a good fit with Buckeyes sustainability vision.
 
We look forward to helping create new environmentally preferable energy and cellulosic products from renewable resources, Crowe said.  This research and development project is about making products that will improve peoples lives, reducing Americas dependency on foreign oil, reducing human impact on the environment and creating a sustainable economy.
 
Our wood cellulose manufacturing has always had an element of sustainability, but there is much more to be done.  We believe the IFAS research facility will develop a new business model for cellulose-related industries.
 
Such industries will incorporate technologies such as those offered by Myriant, which specializes in the development of low-cost cellulosic compounds that can serve as feedstock for sustainable production of high-value chemicals, said Stephen Gatto, Myriant chairman and CEO.
 
This will be the first integrated pilot plant that fulfills the vision of the true biorefinery, Gatto said. By combining the production of high-value specialty chemicals with biofuels from cellulosic materials, the facility will demonstrate the method to maximize value in a renewable, sustainable manner. Myriant is proud to expand on its already successful relationship with the University of Florida and Dr. Ingram.

The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results
Fourth quarter Net Income of $46.5 million or $1.20 per share including $39.6 million or $1.02 per share from Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits
Debt Reduced by $61 million during the Quarter
Shipment Volume, Net Sales and Gross Margin % all Improved Versus 3
rd
Quarter
Sales off 18% versus Year-Ago Quarter due to Reduced Demand, Lower Pricing and Mix
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 4, 2009--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced fourth quarter net income of $46.5 million or $1.20 per share. Fourth quarter earnings included net income of $39.6 million, or $1.02 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits for the period from February 12, 2009 through June 30, 2009. Net sales were $177 million for the fourth quarter compared to $215 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Excluding income from alternative fuel mixture credits, adjusted net income was $6.8 million, or $0.18 per share versus fourth quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $9.3 million, or $0.24 per share. This $0.06 per share decrease in earnings, compared to last year, was driven by reduced operating income (-$0.10 per share after tax) due primarily to the economic downturn which has reduced shipment volumes and resulted in unfavorable grade mix changes in our specialty fibers segment. The impact of reduced operating income was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate (+$0.04). While overall selling prices were lower, primarily driven by declines in fluff pulp prices, this was more than offset by lower input prices for raw materials, energy and transportation costs net of an increase in chemical costs.
Compared to the third quarter, sales rose 3.1% and adjusted operating income excluding the alternative fuel mixture credits rose 11.5%. This improvement was driven by higher shipment volumes and lower input costs. This was partially offset by lower selling prices and mix.
Total debt declined by $61.1 million to $327.5 million during the quarter, of which $38.0 million was due to the alternative fuel mixture credit and $23.1 million was due to strong cash flow from operations and reduced capital spending. This allowed us to use the available borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility to retire all of our outstanding $110 million in senior subordinated debt on July 31. Our nearest term debt maturity is now July 2012, when our $200 million revolving credit facility matures. This move is expected to yield significant interest savings, beginning in August, as we have replaced 8.0% fixed rate bonds with variable interest rate borrowings on our bank revolver with current interest rates of about 1.6% (LIBOR + 1.25%). As of July 31, total debt was $310 million and availability on our bank revolver was $85 million.
Net sales for the fiscal year were $755 million, down 8.6% compared to record sales of $826 million in fiscal 2008. Net income for the fiscal year was a loss of $65 million or $1.69 per share, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.30 per share from the second quarter and income from alternative fuel mixture credits of $1.02 per share in the fourth quarter. Excluding these two special items, total fiscal year adjusted net income was $22.6 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $47.1 million, or $1.20 per share in fiscal 2008.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Our fiscal year ending June 30th, brought to a close a very different and unique year for Buckeye. A first quarter with record sales of $221 million, the challenges of the global economic downturn beginning in the second quarter, the significant goodwill impairment write-down and the alternative fuel mixture credits made FY09 an adventure. Comparing the fourth quarter this year to the same period last year is a comparison of two different worlds and certainly different market dynamics. During the just completed quarter, we continued to run to order and, therefore, we again took significant market downtime at our Memphis and Americana cotton fibers facilities. However, our wood fibers operation ran at full capacity and our nonwovens facilities ran at rates we would consider strong based on the last several years. While not satisfied with our overall annual results, we are pleased that our underlying quarterly earnings improved compared to the previous quarter. Particularly pleasing was the improvement in sales revenue and strong cash we generated from operations in addition to the cash generated from the alternative fuel mixture credits. Over the last several years, we have made significant progress generating cash to reduce debt and improve our balance sheet. Reducing debt by $61MM in the last quarter and retirement of the $110MM of 2010 bonds at the end of July were significant milestones for the Company. Our top priorities continue to be generating free cash flow and paying down debt. We have been successful doing just that.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday morning, August 5, at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (888) 297-0339within the United States. International callers should dial(719) 325-2113.

*This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
The non-GAAP measures used are adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share and are equal to net income, operating income and earnings per share excluding income from alternative fuel mixture credits and goodwill impairment. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it allows for a more meaningful comparison of these financial measures to prior periods, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP.
The Company manages its business units by financial measures which exclude these two items. Operating income and earnings per share targets for our all-employee bonus and at-risk compensation also exclude the benefit of alternative fuel mixture credits and the goodwill impairment charge.

MEMPHIS, TN August 11, 2009 Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it has qualified to receive up to $7.381 million from the State of Floridas Quick Action Closing Fund.  This performance-based incentive provides up-front cash to approved economic development projects.
With the help of this state incentive and support from the Taylor County Development Authority, Buckeye has restarted its Foley Energy Project, which will generate an additional 12 megawatts of electrical power from renewable wood resources and reduce the use of fossil fuels at the site by the equivalent 200,000 barrels of oil per year.
The energy project, which features the installation of a condensing steam turbine at our specialty wood fibers manufacturing plant near Perry, Florida, is expected to temporarily create approximately 148 direct jobs during the installation process, and help retain 555 direct jobs and 1,000 indirect jobs. Buckeye has committed to invest $32.3 million in the turbine and associated equipment that will provide steam to the turbine to complete this project. The project is part of Buckeyes vision to reduce the plants dependency on fossil fuels, improve its impact on the environment, and create a more sustainable business.
 Buckeye is honored and very pleased with the decision of Governor Crist to award funds from the Governors Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Developments Quick Action Closing Fund incentives program to the companys Energy Independence Project. The company is committed to eliminating the use of fossil fuels at our plant near Perry and eventually producing renewable energy for others to use, said Buckeye Chairman and CEO John B. Crowe.

Section 9
Voting Rights
.  .  Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.  Any proxy is suspended when the person executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy, notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy.  At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or irregular.  Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used.
Section 10
Proxies

A Noticing Stockholder must be either a Record Holder or a Nominee Holder.  A Record Holder is a stockholder that holds of record stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the business (including any election of a director) to be appropriately conducted at the meeting.  A Nominee Holder is a stockholder that holds such stock through a nominee or street name holder of record and can demonstrate to the corporation such indirect ownership of such stock and such Nominee Holders entitlement to vote such stock on such business.  Clause (c) of this Section 11 shall be the exclusive means for a Noticing Stockholder to make director nominations or submit other business before a meeting of stockholders (other than proposals brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and included in the corporations notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these bylaws).  Notwithstanding anything in these by-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, Section 12 of these bylaws and this Section 11.
Section 11

.  .  In order for a Noticing Stockholder to properly bring any item of business before a meeting of stockholders, the Noticing Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation in compliance with the requirements of this Section 12.  This Section 12 shall constitute an advance notice provision for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.
Section 12
Notice of Stockholder Business to be Conducted at a Meeting of Stockholders
 
(a)           To be timely, a Noticing Stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation: (i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120) day and not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation; or (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not earlier than the close of business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not
th
th

later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
(b): To be in proper form, whether in regard to a nominee for election to the Board of Directors or other business, a Noticing Stockholders notice to the Secretary must:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-5-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-6-
 
 
Such information shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be supplemented by the Holder not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-7-
 
 
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in Article II, Section 12(a) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by these bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement naming all nominees or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors is first made by the corporation.

Director Indemnification Agreements
 
On October 26, 2009, pursuant to authorization by the Board of Directors of Buckeye Technologies Inc. (the Company), the Company entered into indemnification agreements (the Indemnification Agreements) with each of its directors. Each of the Indemnification Agreements provides, among other things, that each director (and in certain situations, a directors spouse) shall have a contractual right (i) to indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law for losses suffered or expenses incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed litigation or other proceeding relating to that persons service as a director of the Company, (ii) subject to certain limitations and procedural requirements, to the advancement of expenses paid or incurred in connection with such litigation or other proceeding, (iii) to certain procedural and other protections effective upon a change in control of the Company, including but not limited to the creation of a trust to secure the Companys indemnification obligations, and (iv) to coverage under the Companys directors and officers insurance policies, to the extent that the Company maintains such insurance policies and they are reasonably available, with comparable levels of coverage as the policies in effect as of the date of the Indemnification Agreements.
 
The foregoing summary of the Indemnification Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

THIS AGREEMENT (the Agreement) is made on this ___ day of _____________, 2009 between a Delaware corporation (the ), and ():
BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES INC.,
Company
[Name]
Indemnitee
 
, Indemnitee is a member of the Board of Directors (the ) of the Company and in such capacity performs a valuable service for the Company; and
WHEREAS
Board
 
, the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the Company to indemnify its officers and directors to the full extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the ); and
WHEREAS
Statute
 
, the Statute specifically provides that the indemnification provided thereunder is not exclusive of any other rights in respect to indemnification to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled; and
WHEREAS
 
, the Statute contemplates that agreements may be entered into between the Company and each of the members of its Board with respect to indemnification; and
WHEREAS
 
in order to enhance Indemnitees continued and effective service to the Company, and in order to induce Indemnitee to provide continued services to the Company as a director, the Company wishes to enter into this Agreement relating to the indemnification of, and the advancement of expenses to, Indemnitee as well as to the coverage of Indemnitee under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies (the ).
WHEREAS,
D&O Insurance
 
, in consideration of Indemnitees continued service as a member of the Board, the parties hereby, agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
1.
 
.  In addition to other terms defined and used in this Agreement, the following capitalized terms when used in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:
DEFINITIONS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2

4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.
 
.  Subject to the exclusions specified in Section 3 and to the procedure set forth in Sections 8.1 through 8.6 (and in addition to the obligation under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 to pay Interim Expenses), the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against:
INDEMNIFICATION
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, to the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses and Losses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitees behalf in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification for some or a portion of any Expense or Loss, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company nevertheless shall indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is entitled.  For purposes of this Section 2 and without limitation:
 
 
 
 
 
3.
 
.  The Company shall not be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee for Expenses or Losses under either Section 2(a) or 2(b):
EXCLUSIONS
 
 
 
 
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.
 
.  Neither the settlement or termination of any Proceeding nor the failure of the Company to award indemnification or to determine that indemnification is payable shall create an adverse presumption that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, it shall be presumed that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or payment under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 8.1; and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in
EFFECT OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS
connection with the making of any determination pursuant to either of Sections 8.2 or 8.3 that is contrary to that presumption.  In addition, the termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not affect adversely either the right of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement or the presumptions to which Indemnitee is otherwise entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement nor create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have a particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  If Indemnitee is serving an employee benefit plan at the request of the Company or a Subsidiary, Indemnitees conduct with respect to the plan for a purpose he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants in, and the beneficiaries of, the plan shall be deemed to be not opposed to the best interests of the Company or the Subsidiary.

D&O INSURANCE
 
5.1
 
The Company presently has in force and effect policies of D&O Insurance, copies of which are available for inspection by Indemnitee at the Companys principal executive offices.
 
5.2
 
The Company covenants and agrees that, subject only to the provisions of Section 5.3, the Company shall maintain D&O Insurance providing, in all respects, coverage at least comparable and in the same amount as the D&O Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement for so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a Director or Officer, and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Proceeding.
 
5.3
 
The Company shall have no obligation under Section 5.2 to maintain D&O Insurance if a majority of the Companys independent (non-employee) directors determines in good faith, as a matter of reasonable business judgment, that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium cost for such insurance is substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, or the coverage provided by such insurance is so limited by exclusions as to provide an insufficient benefit.  The Company shall promptly inform Indemnitee in writing of such determination.
 
5.4
 
The Companys indemnification obligation to Indemnitee under this Agreement shall not be affected by any reduction in, or cancellation of, the D&O Insurance (whether voluntary or involuntary on behalf of the Company).
 
6.
 
.
NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS
 
6.1
 
Indemnitee shall give notice in writing to the Company as soon as practicable after Indemnitee becomes aware of any Proceeding with respect to which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement; provided that the failure of Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve the Company of any obligations it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement.
 
6.2
 
In the event any Proceeding is by or in the right of the Company or any Subsidiary, Indemnitee may, at the option of Indemnitee, either control the defense thereof or accept the defense provided under the D&O Insurance; provided, however, that Indemnitee may not control the defense if such decision would affect the coverage provided by the D&O Insurance, if any, to Indemnitee, the Company, any Subsidiary or the other Directors and Officers covered thereby.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company or any Subsidiary.
 
 
 
8
 
 
6.3
 
In the event any Proceeding is other than by or in the right of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company shall be entitled to participate therein at its own expense. Except as otherwise provided below, at the option of the Company, the Company, alone or jointly with any other notified indemnifying party, shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such Proceeding of which Indemnitee notifies the Company, with counsel mutually acceptable to the Company and to Indemnitee.  After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of the Companys decision to assume the defense in any Proceeding, the Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense of the Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation, travel expenses or as otherwise provided below.  Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in such Proceeding but the Expenses in connection with employment of such counsel shall be paid by Indemnitee unless:
 
 
 
 
in each of which cases the Expenses in connection with such Proceeding shall be paid by the Company.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the course of defense of such Proceeding.
6.4
 
In no event shall the Company authorize any settlement imposing any liability or other obligations on Indemnitee without the express prior written consent of Indemnitee.
 
7.
 
.
INTERIM EXPENSES
 
7.1
 
The Company shall advance Interim Expenses incurred by Indemnitee.  By signing below, Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay any amounts advanced pursuant to this Section 7.1 if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.  To obtain payment of Interim Expenses under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request for payment, together with such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to such advancement.  Indemnitee must also furnish to the Company a written affirmation of such Indemnitees good faith belief that:
 
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.2
 
Payment of Interim Expenses shall be made without regard to Indemnitees ability to repay the advance and without regard to Indemnitees ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the provisions of this Agreement.  Indemnitees obligation to repay the Company for advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.  Requests for payment of Interim Expenses in accordance with Section 7.1 shall be paid by the Company no later than thirty (30) days following any such request.
 
8.
 
.
DETERMINATIONS AND PAYMENTS OF INDEMNIFICATION
 
8.1
 
To obtain indemnification under Section 2, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, together with such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.
 
8.2
 
Prior to the occurrence of any Change in Control, the Person or Persons who shall determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the Reviewing Party) shall be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10
 
 
 
The Company shall notify Indemnitee in writing no later than two (2) business days following any determination with respect to the extent of entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement.
8.3
 
After the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be Special Legal Counsel selected in the manner set forth in Section 8.2(b) and approved by Indemnitee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  With respect to all matters arising after a Change in Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement (including the determinations required in the context of Section 9) or any other agreement or under applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of the Company or any applicable Subsidiary now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Proceedings, the Company shall seek legal advice only from such Special Legal Counsel.  Such Special Legal Counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee should be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of such Special Legal Counsel and indemnify fully such Special Legal Counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of such Special Legal Counsel pursuant hereto.
 
8.4
 
If a determination is made, in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3, that Indemnitee is entitled to all or a portion of the requested indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within thirty (30) days after such determination.
 
8.5
 
In the event that no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made within sixty (60) days after Indemnitee has made a request in accordance with Section 8.1, the Indemnitee shall be deemed entitled to such indemnification, absent actual fraud in the request for indemnification or a prohibition of indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, such sixty-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person or persons making the determination decide in good faith that additional time is required for obtaining or evaluating documentation or other relevant information.
 
8.6
 
In the event that either:
 
 
 
 
 
 
11
 
 
 
Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the indemnification rights under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking payment of indemnification or challenging any determination made in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 or any aspect thereof.  Any determination made in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 not challenged by Indemnitee on or before the first anniversary of the date of the determination shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.  The remedy provided for in this Section 8.6 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee in law or equity.
9.
 
.  After the occurrence of a Change in Control, upon the request of Indemnitee, the Company shall create a trust (the ) for the benefit of Indemnitee and from time to time, when requested by Indemnitee, shall fund the Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Interim Expenses and Expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for, participating in, and/or defending any Proceeding.  The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by Special Legal Counsel.  In making such determination, the Special Legal Counsel shall consider, among other things, any continuing availability of D&O Insurance as a source to pay such Interim Expenses and Expenses.  The terms of the Trust shall provide that
ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST
Trust
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trustee (the Trustee) shall be a bank or trust company chosen by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee.  Nothing in this Section 9 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.  All income earned on the assets in the Trust shall be reported as income by the Company for federal, state, local, and foreign tax purposes.  The Company shall pay all costs of establishing and maintaining the Trust and shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all expenses (including attorneys fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the establishment and maintenance of the Trust.
 
 
 
12
 
 
10.
 
.  Indemnitee shall keep the Company generally informed of, and shall consult with the Company with respect to, the status of any Proceeding for which Indemnitee is claiming indemnity under this Agreement.  In addition, Indemnitee agrees to give the Company such information and cooperation as the Company may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitees power regarding any Proceeding, which is or may be subject to this Agreement.  In the event of any payment under this Agreement to or on behalf of Indemnitee, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery in Indemnitee against any Person other than the Company or Indemnitee in respect of the Proceeding giving rise to such payment.  Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do everything reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents reasonably necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
COOPERATION; SUBROGATION
 
11.
 
  All agreements and obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall continue during the period Indemnitee is a Director or Officer and shall continue thereafter, even though Indemnitee may have terminated his or her service as a Director or Officer of the Company, so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding by reason of Indemnitees Corporate Status.
CONTINUATION OF INDEMNITY.
 
12.
 
.  The Company has entered into this Agreement in order to induce Indemnitee to continue as a member of the Board, and acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in continuing in such capacity.
RELIANCE
 
13.
 
.  Each of the provisions of this Agreement is a separate and distinct agreement and independent of the others, so that if any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreements other provisions.  To the extent permitted by law, the parties waive any provision of law, which renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.
SEVERABILITY
 
14.
 
. The contract rights conferred by this Agreement are in addition to, but not exclusive of, any other right which Indemnitee may have or may hereafter acquire under any statute, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company, or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.  The rights granted in this Agreement supersede any similar right granted under any previous written agreement between the Company and Indemnitee with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
CONTRACT RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE
 
15.
 
.  No changes in the law and no amendment to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company after the date of this Agreement shall have the effect of limiting or eliminating the indemnification available under this Agreement as to any act or omission which has occurred, or capacity in which Indemnitee served, prior to such amendment.  If, after the date of this Agreement, any change in any applicable law, statute, or rule expands the power of the Company to indemnify a person based on such persons Corporate Status, Indemnitees rights and the Companys obligations under this Agreement shall be expanded, without any action by Indemnitee or the Company, to include such change.  If any change in any applicable law, statute, or rule narrows the right of the Company to indemnify a person based on such persons Corporate Status, such change, except to the extent otherwise required by law, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties rights or obligations hereunder.
EFFECT OF CHANGES IN LAW OR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS
 
 
 
13
 
 
16.
 
Subject to the same standards, limitations, obligations and conditions under which indemnification is provided to an Indemnitee under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify a Spouse who is or is threatened to be made a Party to a Proceeding solely by reason of his or her status as Indemnitees spouse.  A Spouse also may be entitled to advancement of Expenses to the same extent that Indemnitee is entitled to advancement of Expenses herein.
SPOUSAL INDEMNIFICATION.  
 
17.
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any corporation or other entity which may have acquired all or substantially all of the Companys assets or business or into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his/her spouse, successors, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.  The Company shall require any successor or assignee (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces First Quarter FY 2010 Results
Net Income of $39.2 million or $1.00 per share including $35.1 million or $0.89 per share from Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits;
Sales off 20% versus Year-Ago Quarter; Up Slightly from Fourth Quarter;
Debt Reduced by a further $32.5 million to $295MM
Retired all $110MM of 2010 Notes in July;
Received $7.4 million grant from State of Florida; Restarted Energy Project
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 3, 2009--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced first quarter net income of $39.2 million or $1.00 per share. First quarter earnings included net income of $35.1 million, or $0.89 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits earned during the quarter. Net sales were $177 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to a record $221 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Excluding income from alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC), adjusted net income was $4.1 million, or $0.11 per share versus first quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $8.9 million, or $0.23 per share. This $0.12 per share decrease in earnings, compared to last year, was driven by reduced operating income (-$0.17 per share after tax) due primarily to the economic downturn which has resulted in reduced shipment volumes and in a less favorable grade mix. While overall selling prices were lower, this was offset by lower input prices for raw materials, chemicals, energy and transportation costs. The impact of reduced operating income was partially offset by lower interest expense (+$0.03) and reduced foreign exchange loss (+0.01).
Adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding the impact of the AFMC, were $0.07 lower than the $0.18 earned in the fourth quarter. A higher effective tax rate accounted for $0.06 of this reduction in earnings. The drop in adjusted operating income, including a $0.01 cost relating to staffing reductions implemented during the quarter at our Memphis cotton specialty fibers plant, was mostly offset by lower interest expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter, sales were up slightly as shipment volumes were up about 4% but this was offset by lower pricing and a less favorable grade mix. Alternative fuel mixture credits earned during the quarter, at $35.8 million net of expenses, was down by $18.4 million compared to the fourth quarter because we recognized income for the first four and a half months of earned credits during that quarter.
Total debt declined by a further $32.5 million to $295.0 million during the quarter, of which $8 million was due to cash generated by the alternative fuel mixture credit, and $26 million was due to strong cash flow from operations, including a $6 million reduction in inventory. We expect to use a portion of the AFMC in fiscal year 2010 to offset U.S. federal estimated income tax payments and to receive the balance in fiscal year 2011 as a cash refund after filing our 2010 tax return. The receipt of $7.4 million in grant money from the State of Florida in support of our Foley Energy Project reduced the net cash used in investing activities to only $1.4 million for the quarter. As of September 30, we had $23 million of cash and $100 million in borrowing capacity on our credit facility.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, While our sales and earnings, excluding alternative fuel mixture credits, continue to be down significantly compared to the year ago quarter, we are encouraged that our shipment volume has increased sequentially in each of the past two quarters. In the just completed quarter, shipment volumes were up for both wood and cotton specialty fibers and for nonwovens. Capacity utilization at our cotton cellulose plants in Memphis and Americana improved over the preceding quarter, but was still below 50% at both facilities. We further reduced staffing at our Memphis plant during the quarter to better align staffing levels with current market conditions. Increased demand for our high-end wood specialty fibers is expected to yield an improved mix in the current quarter.
The Buckeye organization remains focused on reducing cost and maintaining tight control on working capital. We made significant progress during the quarter toward our recently updated fiscal year-end debt goal of $275 million, reducing our debt to $295 million during the past quarter. A key milestone for us was the redemption of all $110MM of our 2010 notes at the end of July, which moves our nearest term debt maturity out to July 2012 and will result in significant interest expense savings starting in the quarter just completed.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, Buckeye made progress on several other fronts during the past quarter. We have restarted the energy independence project at our Foley mill, with the help of a $7.4 MM grant from the State of Florida, which will help us complete the project. Through September, we have spent $20MM on this $45MM project. We are also finalizing an agreement with the University of Florida for a pilot biorefinery facility at our Foley facility. We continue to look for opportunities in energy and other areas to grow our revenues. While debt reduction continues to be our highest priority, we are now in a better position to allocate capital to high return opportunities like the energy independence project.

SECTION 5  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On April 1, 2009, Buckeye Technologies Inc. (the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K reporting that because of the global economic slowdown and the challenging business environment, it was implementing a salary freeze for all salaried personnel, which included, effective April 1, 2009, the following temporary reductions in base salary for the Companys officers:
10% reduction for CEO John B. Crowe;
6.7% reduction for President/Chief Operating Officer Kristopher J. Matula;
5% reduction for all senior vice presidents; and
3.5% reduction for all vice presidents.
The Company believes that economic conditions have now moderated, and, accordingly, on December 10, 2009, the Companys Compensation Committee acted to end the salary freeze effective January 1, 2010.  The temporary reductions in base salaries for the Companys officers also will end effective January 1, 2010 and officers salaries will be restored to their pre-April 2009 levels at that time.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces Second Quarter FY 2010 Results
Net Income of $46.3 million or $1.18 per share including $37.5 million or $0.96 per share from Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits
Adjusted EPS of $0.22 compared to $0.11 in 1Q-FY10 and $0.07 in 2Q-FY09
Sales up 3% from First Quarter; off 1% versus Year-Ago Quarter
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 26, 2010--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced second quarter net income of $46.3 million or $1.18 per share compared to a loss of $125.0 million or ($3.23) per share in the same period last year. Second quarter earnings included net income of $37.5 million, or $0.96 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC) earned during the quarter. During the same quarter of the prior year, the Companys results included a $127.6 million ($3.30 per share) after-tax loss related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Net sales were $183 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to $185 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Excluding income from AFMC, adjusted net income was $8.8 million, or $0.22 per share versus second quarter fiscal 2009 adjusted net income (excluding non-cash goodwill impairment) of $2.6 million, or $0.07 per share. This $0.15 per share increase in earnings compared to the same quarter a year ago was largely due to increased shipment volume, which was up about 9%, and the resulting improvement in capacity utilization. Also contributing to improved earnings were significantly lower raw material costs and other cost reductions at our cotton specialty plants, and reduced interest expense.
Adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share in the just completed quarter were up $0.11 (+100%) compared to the $0.11 earned in the first quarter excluding the impact of AFMC. This improvement in earnings was driven by a significant rebound in our specialty fibers business. Product mix improved as we shifted volume out of the viscose staple fiber market back into our traditional niche markets like casings, tire cord and ethers due to improving demand in those markets. We also benefited from higher viscose staple fiber and fluff pulp pricing, improving volumes at our cotton specialty plants and lower cotton linter costs compared to the first quarter.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We are encouraged by the improving trends in our business, as evidenced by the strong rebound in earnings versus the first quarter and our first year over year gains since the July-September quarter of 2008. We are benefitting from improved demand, a better mix, rising fluff pulp prices and lower interest expense. We continued to reduce our debt during the second quarter to $290 million, with a target of $275 million by the end of our fiscal year in June. We also completed the redemption of $35 million of our 8.5% 2013 senior notes on January 4 using available cash and borrowings on our bank revolver, which we expect to generate annual interest savings of about $2.4 million per year going forward at current interest rates. The Buckeye organization continues to focus on growing sales, reducing costs and maintaining tight control on working capital.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces Third Quarter FY 2010 Results
Adjusted EPS of $0.28 compared to $0.11 in 3Q-FY09 and $0.22 in 2Q-FY10
Sales up 11% versus Year-Ago Quarter; up 4% from Second Quarter
Debt reduced by $16.5 million as a result of strong cash flow during the quarter
Long-term debt target reduced below $250 million for fiscal year-end
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 27, 2010--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced third quarter net income of $19.3 million or $0.49 per share compared to net income of $4.3 million or $0.11 per share in the same period last year. Third quarter earnings included net income of $4.2 million, or $0.11 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC) recognized during the quarter, which was partly offset by after-tax costs relating to restructuring and early retirement of debt totaling $2.5 million, or $0.07 per share. In addition, income tax expense for the quarter was reduced by $7.4 million, or $0.19 per share for energy investment tax credits earned to-date on progress expenditures for our Foley Energy Independence project, of which $6.6 million or $0.17 per share was related to prior period expenditures. We expect to continue to receive investment tax credits over the next several years based on planned spending on energy projects at our Foley mill. Net sales were $191 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, up 11% versus net sales of $172 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Adjusted net income* for the quarter was $11.0 million, or $0.28 per share versus third quarter fiscal 2009 adjusted net income $4.3 million, or $0.11 per share. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC rules that adjusts net income for AFMC, investment tax credits on prior period expenditures, restructuring and early debt retirement costs and is reconciled in the table below. This $0.17 per share increase in adjusted earnings per share* compared to the same quarter a year ago was largely due to increased shipment volume, which was up about 19%, and the resulting improvement in capacity utilization. The impact of lower selling prices was offset by lower input costs. Also contributing $0.06 to this improvement in adjusted net income was a 46% reduction in interest expense versus the same quarter a year ago largely due to the reduction in long-term debt, which has come down by $115 million over the past twelve months. This was partly offset by a higher tax rate (-$0.04).
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.28 in the just completed quarter were up $0.06 compared to the $0.22 earned in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income* improved by $2.7 million, accounting for $0.04 of this improvement and reduced interest expense added another $0.01. Operating income for Specialty Fibers was up $4.1 million as increased selling prices due to strong demand in most of our markets more than offset higher costs for energy (driven primarily by cold weather) and transportation during the quarter. Operating income for Nonwovens was down $1.2 million as margins were compressed due to rising fluff pulp costs.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, In spite of a slow start in January and February due to the cold weather, our third quarter was a good quarter. Our markets remain very strong and should continue to be so for the near term. Gross margin for the quarter improved to 17.4% of sales, which is the highest level achieved since the October-December quarter of 2007. We generated free cash flow* of $18.2 million during the quarter, enabling us to reduce our debt to $273.5 million and meet our fiscal year-end debt goal one quarter early. We have established a new target to reduce long-term debt below $250 million by the end of our fiscal year in June. We also completed the redemption of an additional $25 million of our 8.5% 2013 senior notes on April 19 using borrowings on our bank revolver, which will reduce the remaining notes outstanding to $140 million and further reduce interest costs going forward. Average selling prices of our products are expected to improve further in the fourth quarter. Also, in the near term, operational reliability and procurement of cotton linters will be the keys to building on the current quarters success.

Buckeye has scheduled a conference call forApril 28, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss third quarter fiscal year 2010 results. Those interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (800) 967-7138within the United States. International callers should dial(719) 325-2306.

Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.
* This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
The non-GAAP measures used are adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow The first three are equal to net income, operating income and earnings per share excluding income from alternative fuel mixture credits, investment tax credits on prior period expenditures, restructuring, and early debt retirement costs.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities.
The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it allows for a more meaningful comparison of these financial measures to prior periods, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP.
The Company manages its business units by financial measures which exclude these items. Operating income and earnings per share targets for our all-employee bonus and at-risk compensation also exclude the benefit of alternative fuel mixture credits. Free cash flow is provided because it is widely used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in our industry.
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as assumptions, target, guidance, outlook, plans, projection, may, will, would, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, potential, or continue (or the negative or other derivatives of each of these terms or similar terminology). The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the economic outlook for the Company and the demand for its products, the receipt of future investment tax credits and debt reduction goals.
These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors. A discussion of factors that could cause results to vary is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and other period filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES FLORIDA FACILITY BACK IN OPERATION FOLLOWING POWER FAILURE
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI)  today announced that its Foley Plant in Perry, Florida, which manufactures specialty wood cellulose and fluff pulp, is back in operation following a power failure and electrical surge that occurred last Thursday,  June 17.  The power failure was triggered by a malfunction in a main incoming electrical line from a power provider and caused an unplanned complete shutdown of the facility that damaged numerous pieces of equipment.   Purchased power has been fully restored to the facility, and one of the plants two production lines resumed operation at reduced rates on Sunday.  Company officials are targeting for the second line to resume operation by We dnesday.
MEMPHIS, TN June 21, 2010
Buckeye Chairman and CEO John B. Crowe said, "We appreciate the efforts of our employees and contractors who literally have worked around the clock in a safe manner since Thursday's power failure and surge to test motors and other equipment, to identify the damaged equipment and then to replace it.  Replacement equipment has been ordered and shipped in on an emergency basis.  We will be working during the week to minimize the impact of this event on our customers.  The production of the Foley Plant remains sold out, and our highest priority is to continue safely returning the plant to full capacity in compliance with our environmental permits so that we can meet our customers needs.
The Company indicated that it presently is unable to fully quantify the financial impact of the event.  However, depending on the timing of returning to full production, the Company estimates that the financial impact of the outage, excluding the effect of any insurance proceeds, could be in the range of a $4 to $5 million reduction in pretax operating income for the quarter ending June 30.  This would result in earnings in the range of 24 to 27 cents per share for the quarter.  The Company reported that it has property loss and business interruption insurance with a single $2 million deductible and has received a preliminary report from its insurance broker that the event is a covered loss.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the expectation for returning the Foley plant to full operation.
These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors.

Item 5.02                      Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Form of Performance Share Agreements
 
On July 20, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Buckeye Technologies Inc. (Buckeye) approved a new form of Performance Share Award (an Award) for certain officers, including Buckeyes named executive officers, for use under Buckeyes 2007 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan).
 
.  Each Award and the terms of the Plan incorporated in an Award provide for the grant of a target number of performance shares that will be paid out in shares of Buckeye common stock once the applicable performance and vesting criteria have been met.  The number of performance shares in which the recipient may vest will depend upon achievement of certain performance criteria specified by the Committee at the time of grant. If the performance criteria, based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Buckeyes common stock compared to the TSR of Buckeyes peer group of competitors (as determined by the Committee), are deemed achieved during the performance period specified by the Committee, each Award will provide that the re strictions applicable to a portion of such performance shares will lapse, so long as the applicable grant recipient remains an employee of Buckeye or any of its subsidiaries through the end of such performance period.  The Committee will determine Buckeyes TSR and the peer group TSR.  If any portion of the performance shares remain unvested after determination of the Buckeye TSR and the peer group TSR, such performance shares will be forfeited with no further compensation.
General Terms
 
In addition, and subject to a recipients continued service with Buckeye and any of its subsidiaries, the restrictions applicable to performance shares will lapse upon the first to occur of (1) the recipients death, (2) termination of service with Buckeye or its subsidiaries as a result of the recipients disability or (3) a change in control of Buckeye.  If a recipients service with Buckeye and its subsidiaries terminates for any other reason before the end of an applicable performance period, his or her award will be forfeited with no further compensation.  However, if a recipient terminates employment due to retirement (as defined below), a pro-rated portion of such recipients award based on (a) the number of days in the performance period during which he or she was an employee of B uckeye divided by (b) the number of days in the applicable performance period will not be forfeited, and such pro-rated portion of the award will remain eligible to vest based on the vesting percentage attained at the end of the performance period.  Retirement means voluntary termination of employment either (1) at or after a recipients attainment of age 55 with the approval of Buckeyes chief executive officer or (2) at or after a recipients attainment of age 62.  If a recipient is terminated by Buckeye or any of its subsidiaries for cause, his or her entire award (including, to the extent possible, any vested performance shares) will be forfeited with no further compensation.
 
Terms of Awards will be substantially similar to those set forth in the form of Performance Share Award filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.  This summary of terms of the Performance Share Aware is qualified in its entirety by such form of Performance Share Award, which is incorporated in this Current Report by reference.

Award
 
This Award is subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan, which are incorporated in this Award letter by reference.  In the event of any contradiction, distinction or difference between this letter and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.  Unless otherwise stated, all capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
 
By accepting this Award you (i) acknowledge that you have received and read a copy of the Plan and understand its terms and (ii) acknowledge that with respect to this Award and the Performance Shares, you are bound by the terms of the Plan.
 
Subject to your continued service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the restrictions applicable to a portion of your Performance Shares will lapse, if at all, based on the total shareholder return of the Companys Common Stock (the Companys TSR) from [DATE] until [DATE] (the Performance Period) compared to the total shareholder return of the Companys peer group of competitors [as determined by the Committee]over the Performance Period.  If the common stock of any entity in the Peer Group is not traded on an exchange or other quotation system and the trading price is not otherwise publicly available for any reason, including without limitation by reason of a corporate transaction, liquidation, bankruptcy, de-listing or otherwise, such entity will be eliminated from the de termination of Peer Group TSR.  The Committee will determine the Companys TSR and the Peer Group TSR as soon as administratively feasible following the Performance Period.  Upon such determination:
Any portion of your Performance Shares which remain unvested after determination of the Company TSR and the Peer Group TSR shall be forfeited, with no further compensation due to you.
In addition to the foregoing schedule, and subject to your continued service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the restrictions applicable to your Performance Shares will lapse upon the first to occur of the following:
 
 
 
 
Should your service with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminate for any other reason before the end of the Performance Period, then your Award shall be forfeited with no further compensation due to you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you terminate your employment with the Company prior to the end of the Performance Period due to retirement (as defined below), a pro-rated portion of your Award based on the number of days in the Performance Period during which you were an employee of the Company over [the number of days in the Performance Period], will not be forfeited and such pro-rated portion will remain eligible to vest based on the vesting percentage attained at the end of the Performance Period, as described above.  Upon such retirement, all references to your Award herein shall be to your Award as so reduced in the previous sentence.  For the purposes of this agreement, retirement shall mean your voluntary termination of employment, either (i) at or after your attainment of age fifty-five (55) with the approval of the Companys Chief Executive Officer or with the approval of the Board with respect to Awards made to the Companys Chief Executive Officer or (ii) at or after your attainment of age 62.  Finally, if you are terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause, your entire Award (including, to the extent possible, any vested Performance Shares) shall be forfeited with no further compensation due to you.
Your acceptance of this Award will not typically constitute a taxable event.  Instead, you will recognize taxable income upon vesting, if any, described above.
 
You must make appropriate arrangements with the Company to provide for the withholding of the taxes that will be due with respect to this Award.  To satisfy your tax withholding obligation, you may (i) tender cash payment to the Company in an amount equal to the required withholding, (ii) direct the Company to retain a number of Performance Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of vesting equal to the minimum amount legally required to be withheld or (iii) use any other method permitted by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
So long as certificates are generally issued for other shares of stock of the Company, then you may receive certificate(s) for the shares designating you as the registered owner.  If certificates are generally issued for other shares of the stock of the company, then as promptly after each vesting date as possible, the Company will issue to you, or if such certificates were previously issued, the Company will deliver to you, certificates for your vested shares of Performance Shares.  At the Companys discretion, delivery may be made electronically rather than via delivery of physical certificates.
 
The construction and interpretation of any provision of this Award or the Plan shall be final and conclusive when made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or its designee(s).
 
 
 
 
Nothing in this letter shall confer on you the right to continue in the service of the Company or its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate your service at any time.
 
You should sign and return a copy of this agreement to the Companys General Counsel indicating your agreement to the terms of this letter and the Award granted hereby.  This acknowledgement must be returned within thirty (30) days; otherwise, the Award shall lapse and become null and void.  Your signature will also acknowledge that this letter reflects our final agreement regarding the Award granted hereunder and supersedes any prior written or oral agreement, understanding or communication otherwise regarding your Award, and that you have received and reviewed the Plan and that you agree to abide by the applicable terms of these documents as provided herein.

BUCKEYE INITIATES FIRST EVER QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND
 
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared its first regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per common share payable on September 15, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 16, 2010.
MEMPHIS, TN August 3, 2010
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe, said "We are pleased to be able to initiate a regular dividend for the first time in the Companys history.  As we have discussed in recent quarterly earnings calls, Buckeye is now well positioned to take a more balanced approach in its allocation of capital as a result of the success we have had over the last several years in reducing our debt and growing our cash flow.  In July, we have reduced our total debt well below the bottom end of our target debt range of $200 - $250 million.   In addition, this fall we will complete the first phase of our Foley energy independence project and expect to begin realizing savings from this project in the first quarter of calendar 2011.  The dividend amounts to approximately $6.5 million on an annua l basis, which represents a payout ratio based on adjusted fiscal 2010 net income (excluding special items) of 18%.  This in essence is cash flow that was formerly used to reduce our debt and pay our interest expense and now will be used to return cash to shareholders.
Mr. Crowe continued, Our objectives for returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends are to increase shareholder returns and to broaden our shareholder base.  We expect that Buckeye will continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to pay this dividend and grow it over time while also continuing to invest in high-return projects and growth opportunities.  Repurchasing shares continues to be another option, subject to market conditions and bond covenant restrictions.  Our objective with share repurchases would be to increase shareholder value by generating returns greater than our cost of capital.  Currently, we have authorization to repurchase 5.6 million shares, and we would anticipate that any stock repurchases would be made from time to time on an opportunistic basi s through open market purchases.
 
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.
Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as assumptions, target, guidance, outlook, plans, projection, may, will, would, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, potential, or continue (or the negative or other derivatives of each of these terms or si milar terminology). The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the Company's intention and ability to generate cash flow to pay dividends and repurchase stock in the future, the completion of the Foley energy independence project and expected savings from that project. These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting the Companys operations, financing, markets, products, services and prices, and other factors.  For further information on factors which could affect the Company and the statements contained herein, please refer to the Companys Annual Report on For m 10-K and other periodic filings that it makes from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

BUCKEYE ANNOUNCES $140 MILLION REDEMPTION OF NOTES
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it is calling for redemption prior to their maturity $140 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% Senior Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes) at a redemption price of 101.417% of their principal amount in accordance with their terms. Buckeye will redeem these notes on October 1, 2010.  Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 2013 Notes will remain outstanding.  A formal notice of redemption is being sent separately to the affected holders of the 2013 Notes, in accordance with the terms of the indenture for these Notes.  Buckeye plans to finance this redemption using drawings from its $200 million revolv ing credit facility and cash on hand.  This redemption is expected to result in a one-time charge for early extinguishment of debt in Buckeyes fiscal first quarter of $3.6 million (of which $1.6 million is a non-cash charge), or about 6 cents per share.  We expect to realize monthly interest savings of approximately $0.8 million assuming variable interest rates remain close to current levels. Separately, we are actively considering refinancing our revolving credit facility with a new and larger five-year revolver before year end.

BUCKEYE COMPLETES REDEMPTION OF SENIOR NOTES
 Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BKI) today announced that on October 1, 2010 it completed the redemption of its remaining 8.5% Senior Notes due 2013.  Buckeye redeemed these notes using a combination of drawings on Buckeyes $200 million revolving credit facility and cash on hand.

Schedule 5.14 to Credit Agreement
Although the Company is presently in compliance in material respects with Environmental Laws, the effectiveness of the reclassification of the Fenholloway River will require significant expenditures in order for Buckeye Florida, Limited Partnership to remain in compliance.
 
The Foley Plant near Perry, Florida discharges treated wastewater into the Fenholloway River. Under the terms of a 1995 agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Company agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain Class III (fishable/swimmable) status for the Fenholloway River under applicable Florida law and regulations (the Fenholloway Agreement). Under the Fenholloway Agreement the Company must among other things: (i) make process changes within the Foley Plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge; (ii) restore certain wetlands areas; (iii) relocate the wastewater discharge point into the Fenholloway River to a point closer to the mouth of the river; and (iv) provide oxygen enrichment to treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location.
 
The Company has already made significant expenditures and completed the in-plant process changes required by the Fenholloway Agreement. The Company estimates, that it may incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with its remaining obligations under the Fenholloway Agreement and the expected requirements of a renewed NPDES discharge permit.
 
In August 2005 FDEP drafted a proposed renewal of the Buckeye National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The FDEP completed the required public notice, review and comment process and issued the formal Notice of Intent to Issue Permit in November 2005.  The proposed permit was challenged by some members of the public.  In January 2008, the pending administrative hearing was dismissed due to anticipated revisions to the permit based on additional studies and development of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Fenholloway River.  The development of the TMDL is necessary because the EPA and FDEP have listed the Fenholloway River as an impaired water (not meeting all water quality standards) under the Clean Water Act for certain pollutants.   The additional studies necessary to support revisions to the permit have been completed.  As a result, we filed petitions with the FDEP for the establishment of Site-Specific Alternative Water Quality Criteria (SSACs) for the Fenholloway River.  The Florida Environmental Regulation Commission adopted a rule establishing a SSAC for the Fenholloway River and the FDEP approved the other SSACs.  SSACs require the approval of the EPA, and a request for EPA approval has been filed. The revised draft NPDES permit to be issued by FDEP will be based upon modeling performed in conjunction with the EPA and the FDEP, will address the TMDL established for the Fenholloway River by the EPA and will also contain Water Quality Based Effluent Limits based on the new SSACs.  When the FDEP issues the revised draft permit it will be subject to public comment and opportunity for requesting a hearing.
We expect to incur additional capital expenditures related to our wastewater treatment and discharge of between $40 million and $60 million over at least five years, possibly beginning as early as fiscal year 2012.  The amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors including when the final NPDES permit is issued and its final terms and conditions.
As mentioned above, the EPA and FDEP have listed the Fenholloway River as an
 
 
 
 
Schedule 5.14 to Credit Agreement
 
impaired water (not meeting all applicable water quality standards) under the Clean Water Act for certain pollutants. The permitting proceedings discussed above are expected to address these water quality issues.
 
The Foley Plant is also subject to FDEP and EPA air emission standards.  In 2007, new EPA boiler air emission regulations (boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards) applicable to the Foley Plant were vacated following a public legal challenge.  EPA re-proposed those regulations in April 2010.  The public comment period for that proposed rule ended on August 23, 2010, but EPA has not issued its final regulation for the boiler MACT.  These regulations may impact both bark boilers at the Foley Plant.  However, since EPA has not promulgated a final rule, it is difficult to predict the potential capital expenditures associated with these pending regulations.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces Second Quarter FY 2011 Results
Adjusted 2Q EPS of $0.50 compared to $0.22 in 2Q-FY10 and $0.34 in 1Q-FY11
Record adjusted EPS excluding effects of energy tax credits on prior periods
Sales up 14.3% versus Year-Ago Quarter
Quarterly dividend increased by 25% to $0.05 per share
Further sales and earnings growth expected in second half
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 25, 2011--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced second quarter net income of $17.1 million or $0.42 per share. Second quarter earnings included after-tax costs relating to early retirement of debt, restructuring, and accrued interest associated with the cellulosic biofuel credit totaling $3.2 million, or $0.08 per share. This compared to net income of $46.3 million or $1.18 per share in the prior year comparable period, which included net income of $37.5 million, or $0.96 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC).
Net sales were $209.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, up 14% versus net sales of $183.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 due to higher selling prices and improved mix. Shipment volume was down 4% year over year as we finished rebuilding inventories at our Foley mill and specialty cotton fibers shipments were impacted by limited availability and high prices of cotton linters.
Excluding AFMC and cellulosic biofuel tax credits, early debt retirement costs and restructuring expenses, adjusted net income was $20.3 million, or $0.50 per share versus second quarter fiscal 2010 adjusted net income* of $8.8 million, or $0.22 per share. The $0.28 per share increase in adjusted EPS*, compared to the prior year period, was largely driven by higher selling prices in the specialty fibers segment and reduced interest expense. Also, the final insurance settlement related to the June power outage at our Florida specialty wood pulp facility added $0.05 (net of expenses) to second quarter EPS, representing a partial recovery of related costs of $0.04 per share in the July-September 2010 quarter and $0.06 per share in the April-June 2010 quarter.
Comparing the second quarter to the first quarter of FY11, sales were up $7.4 million as increased shipment volume from the Companys specialty cotton fibers plants combined with higher selling prices and improved mix in the specialty fibers segment offset the impact of reduced nonwovens shipment volumes. Adjusted EPS* was up $0.16 from the first quarters $0.34. The impact of the final insurance settlement on the second quarter versus the cost impact of the power outage on the first quarter accounted for $0.09 of the increase in adjusted EPS. Net interest expense was down $1.9 million due to the refinancing of $140 million of public debt at the beginning of the quarter with our lower cost bank revolver, accounting for another $0.03 improvement in EPS. The remaining $0.04 improvement was due to increased production volumes across our wood and cotton specialty fibers plants, an increase in specialty cotton shipment volume, and selling price increases for specialty cotton and fluff pulps, which were partially offset by lower operating income in nonwovens due to seasonally reduced volumes. Overall, gross margin improved from 18.0% in the first quarter to 21.2% in the second quarter.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We were very pleased with our second quarter financial results. Excluding special items such as the significant income we recognized in past quarters related to the various fuel tax credits, this was a record earnings quarter for Buckeye. Earnings showed strong improvement compared both to the same quarter a year ago and to the immediately preceding quarter, and we expect this upward trend to continue. The demand for specialty wood pulp remains very strong, with average selling prices up by about 17% on January 1 compared to the second quarter average and up more than 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Fluff pulp prices remain at high levels. We now have more than 90% of our Memphis cotton linter pulp demand covered by long-term sales contracts containing cost pass-through provisions. Input costs for specialty fibers remain fairly stable with the exception of cotton linters. After the seasonally weak second quarter, we expect nonwovens sales and earnings to improve in the third quarter on increased shipments, increased selling prices and stable fluff pulp prices. We should start to realize cost savings during the next two quarters as phase one of our Foley energy independence project continues to ramp up this quarter and from the recent move to one-machine operation at our Delta airlaid plant.
Mr. Crowe continued, In spite of increased capital spending for acquiring land adjacent to our Florida specialty wood facility and on our Foley energy independence project along with cash outflows for bond interest, retirement plan funding and property taxes, our long-term debt was reduced by $1 million during the second quarter. We expect to generate sufficient cash flow during the next two quarters which should allow us to reduce long-term debt to about $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Based on several measures, this would be the lowest debt level in our history. Given our positive outlook going forward and our demonstrated ability to consistently generate strong cash flows, Buckeye will be increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 25% from $0.04 to $0.05 with its March 15 dividend payment. We continue to be encouraged about our outlook and ability to continue to increase shareholder value.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
*This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
The non-GAAP measures presented
are adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share and are equal to net income, operating income and earnings per share excluding the after-tax effects of alternative fuel mixture credits and cellulosic biofuel credits, restructuring cost and early debt extinguishment cost.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release also contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as assumptions, target, guidance, outlook, plans, projection, may, will, would, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, potential, or continue (or the negative or other derivatives of each of these terms or similar terminology). The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the economic outlook for the Company and the demand for its products, expected cost reductions associated with our recent move to one-machine operation at our Delta plant and the completion of our Foley energy independence project, and expected levels of cash flow and debt reduction. These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors. A discussion of factors that could cause results to vary is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and other period filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We calculate EBITDA as earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting plus interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by adding back the following items: asset impairment charges, non-cash charges and other (gains) losses and deducting any non-cash expense associated with alternative fuel mixture credits. You should not consider adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative measure of our net income, as an indicator of operating performance; or our cash flow, as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds with the definition contained in our US revolving credit facility, established on October 22, 2010, and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants. Although we believe adjusted EBITDA enhances your understanding of our financial condition, this measure, when viewed individually, is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures (e.g., net sales, net earnings, net cash flows, etc.). Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the definition contained in our new credit facility.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Announces Third Quarter FY 2011 Results
Record sales revenue and earnings
Net sales up 25% versus year-ago quarter
Adjusted 3Q EPS* of $0.71 compared to $0.28 in 3Q-FY10 and $0.50 in 2Q-FY11
Used strong cash flow to reduce debt by $27.5 million or 17% during the quarter
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2011--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced third quarter net income of $28.7 million or $0.70 per share. Third quarter earnings included after-tax costs relating to restructuring and accrued interest associated with the cellulosic biofuel credit totaling $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share. This compared to net income of $19.3 million or $0.49 per share in the prior year comparable period, which included net income of $8.3 million, or $0.21 per share, from alternative fuel mixture credits and energy investment tax credits, net of after-tax costs relating to restructuring and early retirement of debt.
Net sales were a record $237.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, up 25% versus net sales of $190.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 due to higher selling prices and improved mix.
Excluding special items, adjusted net income was $29.0 million, or $0.71 per share versus third quarter fiscal 2010 adjusted net income* of $11.0 million, or $0.28 per share. The $0.43 per share increase in adjusted EPS*, compared to the prior year period, was largely driven by higher selling prices overall in the specialty fibers segment and somewhat better capacity utilization at our Memphis specialty cotton fibers plant due to some improvement in the availability of cotton linters.
Comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of FY11, sales were up $28.3 million or 14% due to higher selling prices and increased shipment volumes. Adjusted EPS* of $0.71 was up $0.21 compared to $0.50 in the second quarter, driven by higher selling prices and increased shipment volumes.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We were very pleased with our record third quarter financial results. Both sales revenue and earnings showed strong improvement compared both to the same quarter a year ago and to the immediately preceding quarter. During the quarter, strong cash flow generation allowed us to reduce our long-term debt by another $27.5 million to $136.6 million. We continue to be encouraged about our outlook and ability to further increase shareholder value. We are focused on generating returns above our cost of capital and continuing our balanced approach to the allocation of capital.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release also contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the economic outlook for the Company and the demand for its products, expected cost reductions associated with our recent move to one-machine operation at our Delta plant and the completion of our Foley energy independence project, and expected levels of cash flow and debt reduction. These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors. A discussion of factors that could cause results to vary is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and other period filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such  claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Company make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

46
 
make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.

Contribution Among Guarantors
The Guarantors agree that, as among themselves in their capacity as guarantors of the Obligations, the ultimate responsibility for repayment of the Obligations, in the event that the Company fails to pay when due its Obligations, shall be equitably apportioned, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, among the respective Guarantors (a) in the proportion that each, in its capacity as a guarantor, has benefited from the extensions of credit to the Company by the Lenders under the Agreement, or (b) if such equitable apportionment cannot reasonably be determined or agreed upon among the affected Guarantors, in proportion to their respective net worths determined on or about the date hereof (or such later date as such Guarantor becomes party hereto).  In the event that any Guarantor, in its capacity as a guarantor, pays an amount with respect to the Obligations in excess of its proportionate share as set forth in this , each other Guarantor shall, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, make a contribution payment to such Guarantor in an amount such that the aggregate amount paid by each Guarantor reflects its proportionate share of the Obligations.  In the event of any default by any Guarantor under this Section 10.10, each other Guarantor will bear, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, its proportionate share of the defaulting Guarantors obligation under this .  This Section 10.10 is intended to set forth only the rights and obligations of the Guarantors among themselves and shall not in any way affect the obligations of any Guarantor to the Lenders under the Loan Documents (which obligations shall at all times constitute the joint and several obligations of all the Guarantors).

Although the Company is presently in compliance in material respects with Environmental Laws, the effectiveness of the reclassification of the Fenholloway River will require significant expenditures in order for Buckeye Florida, Limited Partnership to remain in compliance.
 
The Foley Plant near Perry, Florida discharges treated wastewater into the Fenholloway River. Under the terms of a 1995 agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Company agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain Class III (fishable/swimmable) status for the Fenholloway River under applicable Florida law and regulations (the Fenholloway Agreement). Under the Fenholloway Agreement the Company must among other things: (i) make process changes within the Foley Plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge; (ii) restore certain wetlands areas; (iii) relocate the wastewater discharge point into the Fenholloway River to a point closer to the mouth of the river; and (iv) provide oxygen enrichment to treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location.
 
The Company has already made significant expenditures and completed the in-plant process changes required by the Fenholloway Agreement. The Company estimates based on 1997 projections, that it may incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with its remaining obligations under the Fenholloway Agreement.
 
The EPA objected to the draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit prepared in connection with the Fenholloway Agreement and requested additional environmental studies to identify possible alternatives to the relocation of the wastewater discharge point. The studies focus was to determine if more cost-effective technologies are available to address both Class III water quality standards for the Fenholloway River and anticipated EPA cluster rules applicable to wastewater discharges from dissolving kraft pulp mills, like the Foley Plant.  While these studies were being conducted, implementation of the non in-plant process changes required by the Fenholloway Agreement was deferred.  The studies have been completed, and the EPA provided comments to FDEP on the steps that would be required to overcome the EPAs objections to the draft NPDES permit. In August 2005 FDEP redrafted the Buckeye NPDES permit to address the EPAs comments, and has completed the required public review and comment process. The formal Notice of Intent to Issue Permit was issued in November 2005. The proposed permit was challenged by some members of the public and an administrative hearing to address the issues was subsequently scheduled for April 2007. The April 2007 administrative hearing was continued and has yet to be rescheduled. In the interim, Buckeye has been working with the agencies to correct some technical errors in the proposed permit. The proposed permit recognizes that the in-plant process changes already completed and the additional process changes planned as part of the draft NPDES permit will satisfy the EPAs cluster rule requirements applicable to dissolving kraft pulp mills. Based on the requirements of the draft permit, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $60 million over 8  10 years, possibly beginning as early as 2009. The amount and timing of these capital expenditures

Schedule 5.14 to Credit Agreement
 
may vary depending on a number of factors including when the permit is issued and whether the upcoming hearing results in changes to the proposed permit. A proposed permit condition requiring certain studies could result in additional treatment costs beyond those expected under the draft permit.
 
The EPA and FDEP have listed the Fenholloway River as an impaired water (not meeting all applicable water quality standards) under the Clean Water Act for certain pollutants. The permitting proceedings discussed above are expected to address these water quality issues.
 
The Foley Plant is also subject to EPA and FDEP air emission standards. The EPA had recently adopted new boiler air emission regulations that are applicable to the Foley Plant. However, these regulations have now been vacated and the impact of the anticipated revision of these regulations is not yet known.

About August 1, 2000, Buckeye acquired from Fibra, S.A. and Textilia, S.A. a cotton linter pulp manufacturing facility located in Americana, Brazil. The facility does not comply with certain environmental laws. To remedy that noncompliance, Fibra entered into a Consent Agreement with the Sao Paulo environmental agency ("CETESB") pursuant to which Fibra and Textilia agreed to make certain environmental improvements, including improvements to the waste water treatment facility that is utilized by the site. Certain of the improvements required by the Consent Agreement have been made. Buckeye had until September 2005 to complete the remaining improvements and was granted an extension until December 2006 to conclude installation. The required equipment installations have been accomplished and startup is complete.  Upon achieving the treatment efficiency required by the Consent Agreement, CETESB has agreed to issue the permits necessary for the facility to be in compliance with the applicable environmental laws.

Schedule 5.14 to Credit Agreement
Although the Company is presently in compliance in material respects with Environmental Laws, the effectiveness of the reclassification of the Fenholloway River will require significant expenditures in order for Buckeye Florida, Limited Partnership to remain in compliance.
 
The Foley Plant near Perry, Florida discharges treated wastewater into the Fenholloway River. Under the terms of a 1995 agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Company agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain Class III (fishable/swimmable) status for the Fenholloway River under applicable Florida law and regulations (the Fenholloway Agreement). Under the Fenholloway Agreement the Company must among other things: (i) make process changes within the Foley Plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge; (ii) restore certain wetlands areas; (iii) relocate the wastewater discharge point into the Fenholloway River to a point closer to the mouth of the river; and (iv) provide oxygen enrichment to treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location.
 
The Company has already made significant expenditures and completed the in-plant process changes required by the Fenholloway Agreement. The Company estimates, that it may incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with its remaining obligations under the Fenholloway Agreement and the expected requirements of a renewed NPDES discharge permit.
 
In August 2005 FDEP drafted a proposed renewal of the Buckeye National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The FDEP completed the required public notice, review and comment process and issued the formal Notice of Intent to Issue Permit in November 2005.  The proposed permit was challenged by some members of the public.  In January 2008, the pending administrative hearing was dismissed due to anticipated revisions to the permit based on additional studies and development of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Fenholloway River.  The development of the TMDL is necessary because the EPA and FDEP have listed the Fenholloway River as an impaired water (not meeting all water quality standards) under the Clean Water Act for certain pollutants.   The additional studies necessary to support revisions to the permit have been completed.  As a result, we filed petitions with the FDEP for the establishment of Site-Specific Alternative Water Quality Criteria (SSACs) for the Fenholloway River.  The Florida Environmental Regulation Commission adopted a rule establishing a SSAC for the Fenholloway River and the FDEP approved the other SSACs.  SSACs require the approval of the EPA, and a request for EPA approval has been filed. The revised draft NPDES permit to be issued by FDEP will be based upon modeling performed in conjunction with the EPA and the FDEP, will address the TMDL established for the Fenholloway River by the EPA and will also contain Water Quality Based Effluent Limits based on the new SSACs.  When the FDEP issues the revised draft permit it will be subject to public comment and opportunity for requesting a hearing.
We expect to incur additional capital expenditures related to our wastewater treatment and discharge of between $40 million and $60 million over at least five years, possibly beginning as early as fiscal year 2012.  The amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors including when the final NPDES permit is issued and its final terms and conditions.
As mentioned above, the EPA and FDEP have listed the Fenholloway River as an
 
 
 
 
Schedule 5.14 to Credit Agreement
 
impaired water (not meeting all applicable water quality standards) under the Clean Water Act for certain pollutants. The permitting proceedings discussed above are expected to address these water quality issues.
 
The Foley Plant is also subject to FDEP and EPA air emission standards.  In 2007, new EPA boiler air emission regulations (boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards) applicable to the Foley Plant were vacated following a public legal challenge.  EPA re-proposed those regulations in April 2010.  The public comment period for that proposed rule ended on August 23, 2010, but EPA has not issued its final regulation for the boiler MACT.  These regulations may impact both bark boilers at the Foley Plant.  However, since EPA has not promulgated a final rule, it is difficult to predict the potential capital expenditures associated with these pending regulations.

RE:      Notice of Blackout Period
Buckeye Technologies Inc. (the Company) is changing the recordkeeper for the Merfin Systems 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan").  This notice is to inform you that in connection with these changes, a blackout period will be imposed restricting all investments under and distributions from the Plan.  The blackout period is expected to start as of 4:00 p.m., Central Time, on Thursday, June 23, 2011 and is expected to end no later than the week of July 10, 2011.  During the blackout period, Plan participants and beneficiaries will be unable to direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts, obtain a loan, make a withdrawal, or take other distributions from the Plan.
 
During the blackout period, pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any director or executive officer of the Company is generally prohibited from, directly or indirectly, entering into any transaction with respect to the Companys common stock (including any derivative securities) (Company Securities).     This trading restriction includes indirect trading where you have a pecuniary interest in the transaction.  Accordingly, acquisitions and dispositions by family members, partnerships, corporations, or trusts where you have a pecuniary interest will be deemed a transaction by you.
Specifically, during the blackout period, you are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, purchasing, selling, or otherwise acquiring or transferring any Company Securities, including exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights, if you acquire or previously acquired such Company Security in connection with your service as a director or executive officer of the Company, subject to certain narrow exceptions.
 
There are limited exemptions to the restrictions of Section 306(a) and Regulation BTR for certain transactions in Company Securities.  Notable exemptions include: bona fide gifts; transactions involving Company Securities that were not acquired in connection with your service or employment as a director or officer (which you must be able to prove); and transactions pursuant to a plan intended to comply with the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1, provided that such Rule 10b5-1 plan was not entered into or modified during the blackout period and you were unaware of the actual or approximate beginning or ending dates of the blackout period at the time of the transaction.  Because these exemptions are narrow, proposed transactions should be discussed with Sheila Jordan Cunningham, General Counsel, before you or your family members take any action concerning Company equity securities during this period.
 
Please note that the trading restrictions implemented because of the blackout period are in addition to other trading restrictions under the Companys insider trading compliance policy (the Policy).  During the blackout period, it is anticipated that you will, in any event, be subject to a closed trading window under the Policy.
 
During the blackout period, you may obtain, without charge, information as to whether the blackout period has begun or ended by contacting me at 1001 Tillman Street, P. O. Box 80407, Memphis, TN 38112-2038 or by telephone at (901) 320-8409.

Item 2.05                      Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced plans to close its Delta, B.C., Canada airlaid nonwovens facility by the end of calendar 2012. The Company will work closely with its customers to continue to meet their needs by sourcing products currently produced at Delta from its facilities in Gaston County, N.C. and Steinfurt, Germany.
This closure and consolidation of business will improve capacity utilization, profitability and return on invested capital for our Nonwovens business.  We expect to incur a non-cash asset impairment charge of about $15 million and $5 million in restructuring expenses between now and December 31, 2012. The closure is expected to generate about $30 million in cash over the next 18 months, primarily through the sale of land and buildings and a net reduction in working capital.

 Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced plans to close its Delta, B.C., Canada airlaid nonwovens facility by the end of calendar 2012. The Company will work closely with its customers to continue to meet their needs by sourcing products currently produced at Delta from its facilities in Gaston County, N.C. and Steinfurt, Germany.
MEMPHIS, TN June 17, 2011
Buckeye Chairman John B. Crowe said, This closure has become necessary due to several factors including unfavorable site location relative to customers and raw material suppliers, a strong Canadian dollar, and low capacity utilization.  It is unfortunate that this closure will result in the eventual termination of employment for approximately 95 dedicated employees.  We have owned and operated the Delta facility since 1997 and we value and appreciate the many contributions of the organization over the past 14 years.  In the fall of 2010, we consolidated our production from a two machine operation to one airlaid machine in an attempt to improve the profitability of the site.  Even after this consolidation, which did improve margins, the plants forecasted financial performance remains at an unacceptable level.
We are making this announcement now to allow adequate time to address employee and customer needs.  This 18 month period will allow us time to implement changes that may be needed at Gaston and Steinfurt to meet the needs of our current Delta customers.  This closure and consolidation of business will improve capacity utilization, profitability and return on invested capital for our Nonwovens business.  We expect to incur a non-cash asset impairment charge of about $15 million and $5 million in restructuring expenses between now and December 31, 2012. The closure is expected to generate about $30 million in cash over the next 18 months, primarily through the sale of land and buildings and a net reduction in working capital. From now until the end of 2012, we will focus on meeting the needs of our customers and on maximizing cash flow generation at the site.

The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.
Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting the Companys operations, financing, markets, products, services and prices, and other factors.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeyes Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Results
Record sales and earnings for Fiscal Year 2011
Adjusted 4Q EPS* of $0.68 compared to $0.26 in 4Q-FY11
Record 4Q Sales up 25% versus Year-Ago Quarter
4Q Free cash flow* of $50 million applied toward $40MM in debt reduction and $10MM in share repurchases
Dividend to be increased by 20%
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 2, 2011--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced fourth quarter adjusted net income* of $27.8 million or $0.68 per share. This excludes an after-tax non-cash asset impairment charge of $13.0 million, or $0.32 per share, relating to our recently announced plans to close our Canadian nonwovens plant by the end of December 2012 as well as other special items of $0.6 million or $0.01 per share. Adjusted net income* rose 162% as compared to the prior year periods $10.6 million or $0.26 per share, which excluded after-tax costs of $0.9 million or $0.02 per share relating to early retirement of debt and restructuring.
Net sales were a record $256 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, up 25% versus net sales of $205 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 due to higher selling prices and increased shipment volume. The $0.42 increase in adjusted EPS*, compared to the prior year period, was also driven by higher selling prices and increased shipment volume.
Comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, sales were up $18 million or 8% primarily due to a 6% increase in shipment volume. Adjusted EPS* of $0.68 was off $0.03 compared to $0.71 in the third quarter due to a higher effective tax rate, and higher selling, research and administrative expenses, reflecting increased year-end compensation performance accruals. Adjusted pre-tax income was up by $1.0 million compared to the third quarter.
For fiscal year 2011, net sales were $905 million, a new record and up 20% from $756 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by higher selling prices. Adjusted net income* for the 2011 fiscal year was a record $90.8 million, or $2.23 per share, compared to $34.9 million or $0.91 per share in fiscal 2010. The growth in net income was due to significantly higher selling prices across all parts of our specialty fibers segment, along with a $0.19 favorable impact from reduced interest expense due to the $141 million debt reduction achieved over the course of the year.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We were pleased with our fourth quarter and our record fiscal year 2011 financial results. Fourth quarter revenue was significantly improved over the same quarter a year ago, surpassing the old record delivered in the preceding quarter. We indicated on our last quarters earnings conference call that we expected fourth quarter earnings to be similar to the third quarter, which is the case. Continued excellent free cash flow generation, which amounted to $50 million for the quarter, allowed us to reduce our long-term debt during the quarter by $40 million to $97 million on June 30. At the same time, we repurchased 400,000 shares of Buckeye stock under our outstanding 5.6 million share authorization, representing a return of cash to our shareholders of approximately $10 million. We enter our new fiscal year 2012 with solid momentum.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday morning, August 3, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (800) 533-7954within the United States. International callers should dial(785) 830-1924. Supplemental material for the call will be available on the Companys website at or at .

*This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
The non-GAAP measures presented
are adjusted operating income, adjusted
pre-tax income, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share and are equal to net income, pre-tax income, operating income and earnings per share excluding the after-tax effects of alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC) and cellulosic biofuel credits (CBC), investment tax credits (ITC) on prior period
expenditures, asset impairment cost, restructuring cost and early debt extinguishment cost.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release also contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as assumptions, target, guidance, outlook, plans, projection, may, will, would, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, potential, or continue (or the negative or other derivatives of each of these terms or similar terminology). The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the economic outlook for the Company and the demand for its products, expected cost reductions associated with our recent move to one-machine operation at our Delta plant and the completion of our Foley energy independence project, and expected levels of cash flow and debt reduction. These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors. A discussion of factors that could cause results to vary is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and other period filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeyes First Quarter FY 2012 Results
1Q Sales up 19% versus Year-Ago Quarter
Record Adjusted 1Q EPS* of $0.74 compared to $0.34 in 1Q-FY11
Repurchased 356,000 additional shares for $8.6 million
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 25, 2011--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced first quarter adjusted net income* of $29.9 million or $0.74 per share, which excludes net income of $11.2MM or $0.28 per share from cellulosic biofuel credits generated in 2009. Adjusted net income* rose 118% as compared to the prior year periods $13.7 million or $0.34 per share, which excluded net income of $51.3 million or $1.26 per share from cellulosic biofuel credits generated in 2009.
Net sales of $240 million were up 19% versus last years first quarter sales of $202 million. Sales benefited from higher selling prices and increased cotton linter pulp shipment volume. The $0.40 increase in adjusted EPS*, compared to the prior year period, was driven by these same factors. Aside from significantly higher cotton linter costs, cost inflation for chemicals, transportation and other raw materials was modest with energy prices stable.
Comparing the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, sales were down $16 million or 6% lower as we rebuilt inventories at our Foley mill back to target levels and nonwovens shipment volume was down. Adjusted Operating Income* was flat at $44.0 million even with the lower sales revenue as selling, research and administrative expenses and direct costs were down relative to the fourth quarter, and higher selling prices were sufficient to offset increases in input costs during the first quarter. Adjusted EPS* of $0.74 was up $0.06 compared to $0.68 in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS* benefitted from a foreign exchange gain, lower net interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, We were pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. As we said on our August earnings call, our record fourth quarter revenue of $256 million was going to be hard to duplicate in the first quarter due to very low beginning specialty wood fibers inventory levels. Our first quarter sales revenue of $240 million is our second best quarter ever, and our gross margin of 23.7% of sales was significantly better compared to last years 18.0%. The key drivers to year over year improvements continue to be strong markets and selling prices, better capacity utilization at our Memphis specialty cotton fibers plant, and benefits from our cost improvement initiatives. We maintained a balanced approach to the allocation of the cash flow generated during the quarter. Our excellent first quarter cash flow generation allowed us to pay a record bonus to all of our employees (reflecting the record FY 2011 performance), invest $11 million in capital projects, repurchase 356,000 shares ($8.6 million) of Buckeye common stock, increase our dividend to $0.06 per share, and further reduce our debt by $7 million. We expect strong sales, earnings and cash flow trends to continue.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday morning, October 26, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss first quarter performance. Persons interested in listening by telephone may dial in at (800) 533-7619 the United States. International callers should dial(785) 830-1923.

Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that its Board of Directors approved funding to increase the high-end specialty wood pulp capacity by 42,000 tons at its Buckeye Florida Foley operation.  The cost of the project is expected to be approximately $79 million with an anticipated rate of return of 15% to 20%.  Engineering and design work is nearing completion, and construction is expected to begin in January 2012 with project startup planned for December 2012.  This investment will be funded by cash flow from operations.
MEMPHIS, TN, October 25, 2011 -
Buckeye's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Crowe said, This specialty expansion project will provide much needed high-purity specialty volume for strategic customers in all of our high-end markets including casings, tire cord, ethers, filtration, micro-crystalline cellulose, and acetate. Additionally, this will improve our overall plant product mix from 42% specialty wood pulp to just over 50% specialty wood pulp while maintaining the Foley plants existing total capacity at 465,000 tons per year.  This is the type of high-return organic growth opportunity that we will continue to target as we allocate our free cash flow to its highest and best use.  We believe this project will provide excellent value to our customers and our shareholders.

Item 2.05
 Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced the closure of its Americana, Brazil Cotton linter pulp production line.  The company will work closely with its customers to continue to meet their needs from its Memphis, Tennessee facility.
 
We expect to incur about $2.4 million in restructuring expense in calendar 2012 and a non-cash asset impairment charge of about $49 million in the October  December 2011 quarter.  The closure is expected to generate an approximate $20 million cash benefit, primarily due to tax benefits related to the investment loss, assuming we are able to utilize all of our potential cellulosic biofuel credits by June 2016.  Any additional cash benefit will be dependent on the final outcome of the facility sale process.

Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced the closure of its Americana, Brazil cotton linter pulp production line.  The company will work closely with its customers to continue to meet their needs from its Memphis, Tennessee facility.
MEMPHIS, TN, January 12, 2012 -
Buckeye's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Crowe said, This closure has become necessary due to the facilitys uncompetitive cost position for the products it makes.  This is primarily driven by the high cost of its cotton linter raw material supply.  It is unfortunate that this closure will result in the termination of employment for approximately 60 dedicated employees.  We have owned and operated the facility since 2000, and we value and appreciate the many contributions of the organization over the past 12 years.  Buckeye will continue to operate the waste water treatment facility for the shared industrial site while we continue discussions with interested parties for the sale of the facility.
We expect to incur about $2.4 million in restructuring expenses in calendar 2012 and a non-cash asset impairment charge of about $49 million in the October-December 2011 quarter.  The closure is expected to generate an approximate $20 million cash benefit, primarily due to tax benefits related to the investment loss, assuming we are able to utilize all of our potential cellulosic biofuel credits by June 2016.  Any additional cash benefit will be dependent on the final outcome of the facility sale process.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Brazil.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.

MEMPHIS, TN, January 18, 2012
National Tissues President, Mike Graverson, said, Merfin is an excellent fit and will complement National Tissues core business.  Merfin brings their proprietary dispensing systems and other product extensions to our basic offering.  Adding a second and expandable operating location is a big step in our strategic roadmap.
Buckeye's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Crowe said, We are pleased that our employees in King are now partnered with a strategic industry player.  While it has not been a core business for Buckeye, we have been pleased with our 15 year ownership of Merfin Systems.  We believe this opens up new horizons for this fine company, and enables Buckeye to deploy the proceeds into its strategic operations.
We expect to incur non-cash goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges of about $4 million in the October-December 2011 quarter.  The sale along with associated liquidation of working capital is expected to generate approximately $6 million in cash.

BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES FLORIDA FACILITY RESUMING OPERATION FOLLOWING POWER FAILURE
- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI)  today announced that its Foley Plant in Perry, Florida, which manufactures specialty wood cellulose and fluff pulp, is returning to normal operation following a power failure and electrical surge that occurred last Friday, February 17.  The power failure was triggered by a malfunction in a high voltage electrical line and subsequent transformer failure in its power house.  This resulted in the unplanned, complete shutdown of the facility.  Power has been fully restored to the facility, and one of the plants two production lines resumed operation at normal rates on Sunday.  Company officials are targeting for the second line to resume normal operation on Wednesday, February 22.
MEMPHIS, TN February 21, 2012
Buckeye Chairman and CEO John B. Crowe said, "While this is an unfortunate event, I appreciate the efforts of our employees and contractors with a rapid and around the clock effort to return the plant to normal operations.  Resources have performed in a safe manner to identify the damaged equipment and make the necessary repairs. We are working with all of our customers and anticipate no major customer issues from this event. The Foley Plant remains in a sold out position and we believe current inventory levels are adequate to cover the production losses for the near term.  Our highest priority is to safely return the plant to full operation.
The Company indicated that it presently is unable to fully quantify the financial impact of the event.  However, depending on the timing of returning to full production, the Company estimates that the financial impact of the outage, excluding the effect of any insurance proceeds, could be in the range of a $5 to $6 million reduction in pretax operating income, most of which would impact the quarter ending March 31.  The Company reported that it has property loss and business interruption insurance with a single $2 million deductible and believes based on discussions with its insurance broker that this event is a covered loss.
Buckeye, a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials, is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  The Company currently operates facilities in the United States, Germany, and Canada.  Its products are sold worldwide to makers of consumer and industrial goods.
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as assumptions, target, guidance, outlook, plans, projection, may, will, would, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, potential, or continue (or the negative or other derivatives of each of these terms or similar terminology). The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the expectation for returning the Foley plant to full operation.
These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors. A discussion of factors that could cause results to vary is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and other period filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeyes Third Quarter FY 2012 Results
Adjusted 3Q EPS* of $0.67 compared to $0.71 in 3Q-FY11
Includes $0.04 impact from February power outage at Florida mill
3Q Net Sales down 9% due to plant closure, divestiture and lower volume
Gross Margin of 24.3% - highest level in more than 11 years
Quarterly Dividend increased by 14% to $0.08 per share
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2012--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced third quarter adjusted net income* of $27.0 million or $0.67 per share, which excludes after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the closure of the cotton linter pulp production line in Americana, Brazil and sale of its converting business in King, North Carolina, and after-tax interest expense of $0.4 million or $0.01 per share related to cellulosic biofuel credits. Adjusted net income* was down 7% as compared to the prior year periods $29.0 million, or $0.71 per share, which excluded after tax costs of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, primarily related to accrued interest associated with cellulosic biofuel credits.
Net sales of $217 million were down $21 million or 9% versus last years third quarter sales of $238 million. About $11 million of the reduction in sales was related to the closure or divestiture of under-performing and non-core assets. Nonwovens sales were down $7 million or 11% year over year excluding the impact of the January 31 divestiture of the Merfin Systems converting business. The primary driver was lower shipment volume in North America. The $0.04 reduction in adjusted EPS* compared to the prior year period was the result of the power outage at the Foley specialty wood fibers mill, which the Company announced in late February. The impact of the King divestiture and Americana plant closure on adjusted EPS compared to the year ago quarter was insignificant. An overall net increase in selling prices combined with lower direct manufacturing costs mostly offset the effect of reduced shipment volume and a less favorable mix.
st
Comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of fiscal 2012, sales were down $10 million or 4%. About $9 million of this reduction in sales was related to business divestitures and plant closures. Nonwovens sales were down about $1 million due to a weaker Euro and reduced pricing. While sales volume in Europe was up compared to a seasonally weak second quarter, nonwovens sales volume in North America was down by an offsetting amount. Adjusted operating income* was down $1.0 million due to the negative impact of the February power outage at the Foley mill ($2.4 million net of expected insurance proceeds). The January 1 price increase on our specialty wood pulp grades more than offset lower fluff pulp pricing and a less favorable specialty fibers shipment mix. Costs were relatively stable between the second and third quarters of fiscal 2012. The impact of divestitures and plant closures on operating income between these two quarters was positive $0.3 million. Adjusted EPS* of $0.67 was down $0.02 compared to $0.69 in the second quarter due to the $0.04 impact of the February power outage at the Foley mill.
st
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, This was a very busy and productive quarter for Buckeye. We completed the energy project and the ground-breaking for the Specialty Expansion Project at our Florida mill; we closed our cotton linter pulp facility in Brazil, and we sold our converting business in King, N.C. All of these activities will improve Buckeyes margins and return on invested capital. It was also a challenging quarter due to the power failure in mid-February and subsequent downtime at our Florida facility. This caused our financial performance to come in below the expectations that we shared at our earnings call in January.
We continue to focus on generating both cash flow and returns on investment above our cost of capital, while taking a balanced approach to the allocation of capital. During the quarter, we used our strong cash flow from operations plus an additional $6 million from the sale of our King converting business to fund $22 million in capital expenditures (up $8 million from the previous quarter), pay down debt by $17 million, and pay a quarterly dividend of $3 million. Yesterday, the Board of Directors voted to raise our quarterly dividend to 8 cents per share, and earlier this month, we repurchased another 100,000 shares of our stock for $3.3 million. With our recent moves to address under-performing and non-core assets, we are redirecting the cash and management focus into improving our Nonwovens performance and accelerating growth opportunities like the Foley Specialty Expansion Project. We expect our fiscal year 2012 will be another year of record results helped by our various initiatives.

- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that on Sunday, June 17, Buckeyes Florida wood cellulose fibers facility near Perry, Florida, experienced a significant failure of a steam drum on the number 2 paper machine causing damage to multiple drums and structural damage to the paper machine building and structure. Fortunately, there were no injuries to any personnel working in the area. Following the incident, which occurred about 5:20 p.m. EDT, the plant was shut down in an orderly manner.  A team at the plant, including contractor resources and structural engineers, immediately began an investigation to determine the root cause of the drum failure.  While it is too early to know the extent or timing to return the plant to normal operations, Buckeye management will have more details on the incident later in the week and will provide updates on plans for resuming production.
MEMPHIS, TN June 18,  2012
Buckeye resources are working with all stakeholders including customers, suppliers and employees to manage and minimize the impact of this outage to the supply chain and to operations. 
Buckeye Chief Executive Officer John Crowe stated, Buckeye can and will repair the damage to the number 2 machine and the building.  The safety of people is our highest priority, and we are thankful there were no injuries in this significant incident.

- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced that it has made the repairs on the #1 specialty pulp machine that was damaged  on June 17, due to the significant failure of a steam drum on the #2 fluff pulp machine.  Structural damage to the paper machine building has been addressed and the specialty machine will begin start up today.
MEMPHIS, TN June 22,  2012
Both paper machines have been idled since Sunday evening June 17, when the incident occurred.
There were no injuries to any personnel and there wasnt a fire. A team at the plant, including contractor resources and structural engineers, continue the investigation to determine the root cause of the drum failure.  All drums are being inspected prior to the startup based on the early findings of the comprehensive failure analysis.
With the paper machine building secure, workers have begun the plans and repairs for the #2 paper machine where Buckeye produces all of their fluff pulp. Because the drum failure was on this machine, most of the damage was limited to one area of the paper machine. While it is too early in the repairs and planning to provide a firm timeline, we will provide an estimate early next week.  The timeline depends on procurement of materials and the amount of work to repair and replace drums, pedestals and sole plates.
Insurance company representatives have been on site helping assess the damage. We expect our property damage and business interruption insurance will cover most of the property damage and business interruption losses in excess of our $2 million deductible.   Our 4 quarter earnings will be impacted by more than this amount as we will not be able to recognize the business interruption insurance benefit until the insurance claim is settled, which will result in a benefit to income in fiscal year 2013.
th
Buckeye Chief Executive Officer John Crowe stated, A successful restart of the specialty machine has been a high priority after personnel safety.  We are using preliminary findings from the comprehensive failure analysis and plan to inspect all drums prior to returning them to service. That has been completed for the specialty machine that we are returning to operations today.  Getting back to normal operations on the specialty machine is important to our specialty customers.  We will work around the clock to return the #2 paper machine to operations and are making arrangements with all customers to minimize the impact of the outage on their business.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, I am extremely proud and impressed with the teamwork I have observed from Buckeyes employees, our onsite contractor, venders, and customers.  We also, are using the downtime opportunity to complete scheduled maintenance items that will come off our downtime planning list and this will help us avoid downtime in the future.

- Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced it is targeting the restart of its fluff pulp line for July 4.  The specialty pulp line has been up and safely running at target rates since early Saturday morning, June 23.  The specialty pulp line mix will not be fully optimized until the fluff line is back in operation.  Among other things, the July 4 timeline depends on procurement of materials and the amount of work required to repair and replace drums and other damaged equipment.  Both production lines were idled on Sunday evening, June 17, due to a significant failure of a steam drum on the fluff pulp line.  There were no injuries associated with this incident.
MEMPHIS, TN June 25, 2012
We expect our property damage and business interruption insurance will cover most of the losses in excess of our $2 million deductible.  Net of insurance recovery, we estimate the total net earnings impact of this event to be in the range of 5 to 10 cents per share.  We expect Q4 FY 2012 (April-June 2012) earnings to be reduced by 8 to 11 cents per share as a result of this event.  The net impact on first half FY 2013 earnings (July-December 2012) should be small as we expect to recognize the bulk of the insurance benefits during this period.  We also anticipate the lost production volume due to the outage will reduce sales revenue by about $20 million primarily in the July to December 2012 period.
Buckeye Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Crowe stated, I am proud of our organizations tireless efforts, teamwork and creativity to minimize the amount of production downtime associated with this significant event.  While there is still much work required to get the fluff pulp line safely up and running by July 4 and this date could change, great progress has been made which will help minimize the impact of this production outage on our customers and all of our stakeholders.

The specialty pulp line returned to production on June 23; the fluff pulp line began its start-up on July 4, as previously targeted and communicated in the Companys June 25 press release.
MEMPHIS, TN July 5,  2012
As of today, production on the fluff pulp line was operating within normal ranges and we are producing fluff pulp per our ISO 9001:2008 quality standards.

MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 7, 2012--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced record sales and earnings for fiscal year 2012. Net sales for the year (adjusted to exclude discontinued Americana operations) were $895 million, a new record and up $14 million or 2% compared to fiscal 2011, as higher selling prices offset a $10MM sales reduction due to the divestiture of our King converting business and lower shipment volumes from both our Foley wood specialty mill and our nonwovens business. Adjusted net income* for the 2012 fiscal year was a record $111 million, or $2.76 per share, compared to $91 million or $2.23 per share in fiscal 2011. The growth in adjusted net income was due to significantly higher selling prices for our high-end specialty wood and cotton fiber products which more than offset the impact of lower fluff pulp prices. Net income also benefited in fiscal year 2012 from reduced selling, research and administrative expenses and lower interest expense.
Fourth quarter adjusted net income* was $26.2 million or $0.66 per share. This excludes net after-tax charges of $2.8 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily relating to the sale of our Americana, Brazil cotton linter pulp plant and adjustments relating to the cellulosic biofuel credit. Adjusted net income* was off slightly compared to the prior year periods $27.8 million or $0.68 per share, which excluded an after-tax non-cash asset impairment charge of $13.0 million, or $0.32 per share, relating to plans to close our Canadian nonwovens plant by the end of December 2012 as well as other special items of $0.6 million or $0.01 per share.
Net sales were $225 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, down $24 million or 10% versus record net sales of $249 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 (which have been adjusted to exclude discontinued Americana operations). About $5 million of the reduction in sales was related to the divestiture of our King converting business. Sales from our Foley specialty wood plant were down $10 million due to lower shipment volume. Last years sales benefited from significant shipments from inventory. Sales from the Memphis specialty cotton plant were off $5 million due to supply chain inventory corrections and lower growth projections in the LED TV market. In spite of the reduction in sales revenue and the $0.06 negative earnings impact of the June steam drum failure outage at Foley, adjusted EPS* of $0.66 was only down by $0.02 per share compared to the year ago quarter. Higher selling prices in Specialty Fibers, lower costs and the elimination of underperforming businesses offset most of the impact of lower sales revenue and the June production outage. We generated $50 million in free cash flow* during the quarter, including $6 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Americana assets. We repurchased 750,000 shares ($22 million) during the quarter, bringing total year repurchases to 1.2 million shares ($33 million), or 3% of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. We also reduced debt by $12 million to $59 million. At the end of the quarter our cash and short term investments stood at $47 million.
Comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter of fiscal 2012, sales were up $8 million or 4% primarily due to a 20% increase in shipment volume in our nonwovens segment. Adjusted EPS* of $0.66 was down $0.01 versus the third quarter as increased shipment volume, favorable shipment mix, and falling cotton linter prices mostly offset the $0.06 negative impact of the June outage at Foley.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Fiscal year 2012 was another year of record sales and earnings. During the year, we continued to generate significant cash flow, allowing us to invest in high rate of return capital projects, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and essentially eliminate our debt. With a strong operating performance and actions taken to address underperforming assets, we delivered a return on invested capital (ROIC) in fiscal year 2012 of 16.5%, well above our cost of capital. While Buckeye is well positioned to continue to increase shareholder value, we believe that global economic uncertainty may generate a headwind for us in fiscal 2013.
Our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by the steam drum failure and resulting production outage at our Foley facility in late June. Returning both lines to operation in just 17 days was a remarkable accomplishment by our organization.
Buckeye has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday morning, August 8, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeyes First Quarter FY 2013 Results
1Q Sales down 15% versus year-ago quarter
Foley outage reduced 1Q EPS by $0.04; Sales by $17 million
Gross margin improved to 25.4% vs. 24.3% in 1Q-12
Adjusted 1Q EPS* of $0.62 compared to a record $0.74 in 1Q-FY12
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2012--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced first quarter net sales of $197 million and adjusted net income* of $24.6 million or $0.62 per share. Net sales for the quarter were down $35 million or 15% compared to the year ago quarter, mainly due to lost sales resulting from the June steam drum failure outage at our Foley facility and weaker demand in some of our wood and cotton specialty fibers markets. The sale of the Merfin Systems converting business in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 accounted for $5 million of the year over year reduction in net sales.
Adjusted operating income of $39.0 million was down $4.4 million compared to the year ago quarter on lower sales volumes, although gross margin was very strong at 25.4% for the quarter compared to 24.3% in the year ago quarter, driven by margin improvements at our cotton cellulose and nonwovens plants. The June outage at our Foley mill had a negative impact of $2.2 million on first quarter operating income and $0.04 on EPS. Selling, general and administrative (SRA) expenses of $13.2 million were up $0.8 million year over year due to growth initiative consulting and legal fees incurred during the quarter.
Adjusted net income* of $24.6 million, or $0.62 per share, excludes net income of $5.5 million or $0.14 per share relating to the cellulosic biofuel credit and after-tax restructuring charges of $0.6 million or $0.02 per share. Adjusted net income* was down $5.3 million or $0.12 per share compared to the prior year periods $29.9 million or $0.74 per share, which excluded net income of $11.2 million or $0.28 per share relating to the cellulosic biofuel credit. The year over year reduction in adjusted net income was driven by the drop in adjusted operating income mentioned above as well as by a higher effective tax rate.
Comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, sales were down $28 million or 12%. This was mainly due to a $27 million reduction in sales from the Foley specialty wood fibers facility, as shipments were impacted by the June outage and demand softness in some markets. Adjusted operating income was down $1.3 million due to lower shipment volume and unfavorable mix at Foley, and higher SRA expenses. These were partly offset by higher operating income from our Memphis specialty cotton fibers plant and our Nonwovens segment. The net impact of the June outage was $1.9 million less in Q1 than in Q4. Adjusted EPS* of $0.62 was down $0.04 versus the fourth quarter due to lower adjusted operating income and a higher effective tax rate.
Free cash flow* was negative $21 million for the quarter and long-term debt increased by $23 million to $82 million, as the Company repaid $28 million of alternative fuel mixture credits which will be traded for higher value cellulosic biofuel credits. We currently expect to realize about $40 to $45 million in positive cash flow over the next three quarters relating to the cellulosic biofuel credit. Capital spending continues to be at a high level as Buckeye continues work on a couple of large high return projects. At the end of the quarter our cash and short term investments stood at $48 million. Inventories were up $25 million during the quarter, with about half of that coming from planned restocking after the June outage at Foley and the other half due to weaker demand in some markets. Share repurchases were very limited in the first quarter, but have picked up again in October, as we have repurchased about 290,000 shares for $8.9 million in October through today.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Our first quarter fiscal 2013 financial results came in as we expected, except that the impact of the June outage at Foley on the quarter was less than expected. We are experiencing some weaker conditions in a few of the specialty fibers markets, namely in tire cord, auto filtration and fluff pulp. We are seeing positive signs as well, though, in the LCD/LED markets for our cotton specialty fibers, where we see growth returning in 2013, and in nonwovens, where our shipment volume is up year over year. We were pleased to see our gross margin improve to above 25% in the quarter. During the quarter, we made good progress on our Specialty Expansion Project and the Oxygen Delignification Project at our Florida wood fibers facility. Both are important projects and are expected to come on-line in April and July 2013 respectively, and will be key contributors for revenue growth and cost reduction. In our Nonwovens business, we continue to work toward transitioning the supply of our current customers from our Delta facility to our other two Nonwovens facilities following the Delta closure, which remains on schedule for December 2012.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, While the headwinds we forecasted in August did arrive, we are committed to disciplined execution of our strategy. With continued strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue to provide shareholder value and to meet the challenges of a sluggish economy over the next couple of quarters.

EXHIBIT 3.1
, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, does hereby certify:
BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES
INC.
1.           The name of the Corporation is Buckeye Technologies Inc. (the "Corporation").
2.           This Certificate of Amendment amends the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation as follows:
 Article Eight, paragraph (c) is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following provision is inserted in lieu thereof:
(c) The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be such as from time to time shall be fixed by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors except that such number shall not be less than one (1) nor more than fifteen (15), the exact number to be determined by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors.  Subject to the special right of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation:
 
(i) From the effective date of this Certificate of Amendment until the election of directors at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the board of directors shall be divided into three classes of directors, Class I, Class II and Class III (each class as nearly equal in number as possible), composed, respectively, of directors who were elected at the 2011, 2012 and 2010 annual meetings of stockholders, or directors appointed to fill the vacancy of a director elected at such meetings, with the directors in Class I having a term expiring at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors in Class II having a term expiring at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders and the directors in Class III having a term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases also continue as to each director until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
 
(ii) At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning with the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the class of directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors shall be elected and qualified and, effective with the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the classification of the board of directors shall be eliminated and all directors thereafter shall be elected annually. Vacancies on the board of directors, for any reason, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by (i) the stockholders at an annual
 
 
 
 
 
or special meeting, as provided in the by-laws or (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.  So long as the board of directors consists of classes of directors, any person appointed to fill a vacancy shall be designated by the board of directors as either a Class I, Class II or Class III director, with a term that expires as set forth above; provided that the directors in each class shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. No decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.
 
Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, no director may be removed from office without cause.
 
3.           This Certificate of Amendment was duly adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and Article Nine of the Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
 
 
 
Buckeye Technologies Inc. has caused this Certificate of Amendment to be signed this 24th day of October, 2012.

A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.

A Noticing Stockholder must be either a Record Holder or a Nominee Holder.  A Record Holder is a stockholder that holds of record stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the business (including any election of a director) to be appropriately conducted at the meeting.  A Nominee Holder is a stockholder that holds such stock through a nominee or street name holder of record and can demonstrate to the corporation such indirect ownership of such stock and such Nominee Holders entitlement to vote such stock on such business.  Clause (c) of this Section 11 shall be the exclusive means for a Noticing Stockholder to make director nominations or submit other business before a meeting of stockholders (other than proposals brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and included in the corporations notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these bylaws).  Notwithstanding anything in these by-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, Section 12 of these bylaws and this Section 11.
Section 11
Business Brought Before A Meeting
 
.  .  In order for a Noticing Stockholder to properly bring any item of business before a meeting of stockholders, the Noticing Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation in compliance with the requirements of this Section 12.  This Section 12 shall constitute an advance notice provision for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.
Section 12
Notice of Stockholder Business to be Conducted at a Meeting of Stockholders
 
(a)           To be timely, a Noticing Stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation: (i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120) day and not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation; or (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not earlier than the
th
th
 
 
-4-
 
 
close of business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
 
(b): To be in proper form, whether in regard to a nominee for election to the Board of Directors or other business, a Noticing Stockholders notice to the Secretary must:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-5-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-6-
 
Such information shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be supplemented by the Holder not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-7-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in Article II, Section 12(a) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by these bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement naming all nominees or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors is first made by the corporation.
 
 
                (d)           For purposes of these bylaws, public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As used in these By-laws, the term Stockholder Associated Person means, with respect to any stockholder, (i) any person acting in concert with such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder (other than a stockholder that is a depositary) and (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any
 
 
 
-8-
 
 
stockholder, or any Stockholder Associated Person identified in clauses (i) or (ii) above. The terms Affiliate and Associate are fairly broad and are defined by reference to Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).  An affiliate is any person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.  Control is defined as the "possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise."
 
The term associate of a person means:
 
 
 
(e)           Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors.

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeyes Second Quarter FY 2013 Results
2Q-FY13 shipment volume up 6% vs. 2Q-FY12; up 22% vs. 1Q-FY13
Foley production rate fully recovered from June steam drum failure outage
Strong cash flow from operations reinvested in Foley specialty expansion project
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 29, 2013--Buckeye Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BKI) today announced second quarter net sales of $204.3 million and adjusted net income* of $23.6 million. Adjusted EPS* of $0.60 compared to $0.69 in 2Q-FY12 and $0.62 in 1Q-FY13. Net insurance recovery in 2Q-FY13 was $0.04 per share less than expected.
Net sales for the quarter were down $17.1 million or 8% compared to the year ago quarter. While shipment volume was up 6% year over year, product mix was unfavorable as we shipped about 12,000 tons into the viscose staple fiber market during the quarter as a result of weak demand in some of our high-end markets, particularly from the European tire cord market. The sale of the Merfin Systems converting business in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 accounted for $4.3 million of this reduction in net sales.
Adjusted operating income* of $36.4 million was down $6.7 million compared to the year ago quarter, largely due to unfavorable product mix, in spite of a $6.8 million net insurance benefit related to the June steam drum failure outage at Foley.
Adjusted net income* of $23.6 million, or $0.60 per share, excludes after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $10.7 million or $0.27 per share relating to the closure of our Delta airlaid nonwovens plant, which ceased production in November. Adjusted net income* was down $4.3 million or $0.09 per share compared to the prior year periods $27.9 million or $0.69 per share, which excluded after-tax costs of $3.6 million or $0.09 per share relating to the cellulosic biofuel credit, and after-tax impairment costs of $29.7 million or $0.74 per share relating to the sale of Merfin Systems and the closure of our cotton specialty fibers plant in Americana, Brazil.
Comparison with 1Q 2013
Comparing 2Q 2013 to 1Q 2013, sales were up $7.4 million or 4%. This was driven by a 31% increase in shipment volume from the Foley specialty wood fibers facility compared to a first quarter heavily impacted by the June steam drum failure outage. Shipment volume from our Memphis specialty cotton fibers plant was down 16% in spite of a small pick-up in demand for acetate pulp from the LCD market, and Nonwovens shipment volume was off 8% due to the end of production at our Delta plant and normal seasonal weakness. Adjusted operating income* was down $2.6 million as the favorable impact from the final insurance settlement related to the June outage and increased shipment volume was not enough to offset the unfavorable product mix impact and lower fluff pulp prices. Adjusted EPS* of $0.60 was only down $0.02 versus the first quarter.
Cash Flow and Capital Allocation
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $25.0 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures, at $23.8 million, remained at a high level as Buckeye continues work on the specialty conversion and oxygen delignification projects at its Foley Mill. We also continued to return cash to shareholders during the quarter, with $9.2 million in share repurchases and $3.4 million in dividends paid out during the quarter. Long-term debt increased by $17.4 million but cash also increased by $10.1 million since September 30. Our free cash flow is forecasted to improve considerably during the next six months as black liquor tax credit paybacks, funding of our employee 401K plans, bonus payouts, and Foley property tax payments are all behind us for the fiscal year, and we expect to realize a little over $20 million in proceeds from the sale of the Delta property in February.
Business Conditions and Outlook
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John B. Crowe said, Our second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings came in a bit weaker than expected, with adjusted EPS* below the low end of our earnings call guidance by $0.05. The net positive impact of the final insurance settlement related to the June steam drum failure at our Foley mill, which was received in December, was $0.11, or $0.04 lower than we had anticipated. Otherwise, compared to the high end of our earnings expectations going into this quarter, the main difference was that selling prices on shipments of specialty wood pulp into the viscose staple fiber market were lower than expected, and fluff pulp prices were lower than predicted due to an increase in spot business. We continued to experience weaker market conditions during the quarter in a few specialty fibers markets such as European high performance tire cord, acetate filament, and LCD screens. In order to offset weaker sales into these markets and bring our inventory levels back down, we chose to sell into the viscose staple fiber market for the first time in over two years. We are now experiencing some improvement in the tire cord market with orders up compared to the second quarter. We had good production and shipment volumes in our second quarter. Total shipment volume was up 6% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by increased shipments of specialty wood fibers, fluff pulp, and nonwovens.
Mr. Crowe went on to say, During the quarter, we continued to make good progress on our Specialty Expansion and Oxygen Delignification Projects at our Foley facility. Both are important projects which will be key contributors for revenue growth and cost reduction, and are expected to come on-line in April and July 2013 respectively. We currently expect the demand weakness we have been experiencing in several of our markets to continue into the third quarter before starting to improve. As a result, we expect our third quarter adjusted EPS will be about the same as second quarter earnings excluding the insurance benefit, before improving in the fourth quarter. Our long-term prospects remain positive and we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of a sluggish economy and take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.

The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the economic outlook for Buckeye and the demand for its products, the results and timing of Buckeyes strategic investments and growth opportunities and expected levels of cash flow and debt reduction. These statements are based on managements estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.

The first three measures are equal to net income, pre-tax income, operating income and earnings per share excluding the after-tax effects of alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC) and cellulosic biofuel credits (CBC), goodwill and long-term asset impairment cost, and restructuring cost.
Free cash flow is equal to net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities (excluding purchase of short term investments.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
* As a result of the disposition of our Americana operations in Q4 2012 and resulting end to our continuing involvement with the inclusion of the waste water treatment facilities in the assets that were sold, we believe the results of the operations for this business, including the loss recognized from the sale and less applicable income taxes (benefit), should be reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated income statement. The table below shows the detail behind the loss from discontinued operations for each period reported in the press release financial statements.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 23, 2013, Buckeye Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""), by and among the Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""), and GP Cellulose Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of the Company.
Company
Merger Agreement
Parent
Purchaser
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 10 business days) of the execution of the Merger Agreement, commence an offer (the "") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""), for $37.50 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the ""), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Offer to Purchase and a related Letter of Transmittal that will be distributed to the Company's stockholders by Purchaser and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""), and, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer and satisfaction of certain conditions, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company (the ""), with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon completion of the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (excluding those Shares that are held by Parent, Purchaser, the Company or their respective subsidiaries or stockholders of the Company who properly demanded appraisal for their respective Shares under the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. If Purchaser holds 90% or more of the outstanding Shares following the completion of the Offer, the parties will effect the Merger as a short-form merger without the need for approval by the Company's stockholders. Otherwise, the Company will hold a stockholders' meeting to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger.
Offer
Shares
Offer Price
SEC
Merger
The obligation of the Purchaser to consummate the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including (i) that 75% of the Shares outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (including any Shares owned by Parent and its subsidiaries, including Purchaser) (the ""); (ii) that any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the ""), applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has expired or terminated; (iii) receipt of antitrust clearances in certain other foreign jurisdictions; and (iv) certain other customary conditions. The consummation of the Offer is not subject to any financing condition. The Merger Agreement also provides that the Merger may be consummated in certain circumstances regardless of whether the Offer is completed, but, if the Offer is not completed, the Merger will only be able to be consummated after the stockholders of the Company have adopted the Merger Agreement at a meeting of stockholders, which will require the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the Shares. In such a case, the consummation of the Merger would generally be subject to similar conditions as the Offer conditions, other than the addition of the shareholder approval requirement and the inapplicability of the Minimum Condition.
Minimum Condition
HSR Act

Exhibit 99.1
Buckeye Technologies Inc. ("Buckeye") has received notice from the plan administrator of the Buckeye Retirement Plan and Merfin Systems 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (each, a "Plan" and together, the "Plans") informing participants in the Plans of a pending blackout period (the "Blackout Period") in connection with the tender offer (the "Offer") by GP Cellulose Group LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific LLC, for all of the outstanding shares of Buckeye common stock. Participants in the Plans who participate in the Offer will be prevented from the following with respect to the portion of their accounts held in the Plans during the Blackout Period: exchanges out of Buckeye stock or obtaining a loan, hardship withdrawal or other distribution from Buckeye stock until all processing related to the Offer is completed or the Offer is extended or terminated. The Blackout Period is expected to begin on June 12, 2013 at 4:00 p.m. New York City time and end on June 18, 2013. The Blackout Period is necessary to enable the administrator of the Plans to process participants' instructions with respect to the Plans in connection with the Offer.
This notice is intended to inform you that, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, you generally will be unable to trade in Buckeye common stock in the event that 50% or more of the combined participants in the Plans direct the tender of their Buckeye common stock held under either such Plan in the Offer.
If you have any question about this notice and the required trading restriction, including whether the blackout period has begun or ended, please contact Sheila Jordan Cunningham, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, at 1001 Tillman Street, Memphis, TN 38112 or (901) 320-8100.
