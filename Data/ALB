1 Immediate Release Michael Whitlow (225) 388-7320 Sara McCoy (804) 788-6091 Albemarle Reports First-Quarter 2003 Results Richmond, Virginia, April 23, 2003 -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) reported first-quarter 2003 net income of $21.0 million, or 50 cents per share on a diluted basis. The earnings include the positive effect of a prior period income tax settlement from the Internal Revenue Service of 17 cents per diluted share and the after-tax cumulative effect of a charge for a change in accounting principle related to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" of five cents per diluted share. After adjusting for these items, the Company's diluted earnings per share for first quarter 2003 was 38 cents. First-quarter 2002 earnings per share, which also amounted to 38 cents, included a one cent after-tax special charge for workforce reductions. On a period-to-period comparison, first-quarter 2003 operating results reflect higher sales volumes, reduced manufacturing fixed costs and the positive effects of foreign exchange, offset by higher energy and raw materials costs and lower pricing in certain businesses. First-quarter 2003 net sales of $265.6 million were a first-quarter record for the Company since the sale of the olefins businesses in 1996, up 14.6 percent from first-quarter 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher shipments of flame retardants, the effects of foreign exchange and the sales associated with the addition of the fuel and lube additives products that were acquired in mid- January from Ethyl Corporation, offset, in part, by lower pricing in certain businesses. Average common shares used to compute first quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share were 42,286,000, down from 44,190,000 for the corresponding period in 2002, primarily reflecting the effects of the Company's repurchase of its common shares in both February 2003 and 2002. Mark C. Rohr, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are pleased with the continued progress in our polymer additives business and positive impact of our acquisitions and joint ventures. I believe our 2003 first quarter is a solid performance against some strong headwinds in energy and raw materials. While underlying volumes remain stable, we continue to observe mixed signals regarding improvement in consumer electronics, capital spending and other aspects of the general economy that would indicate that a recovery is in progress." Rohr added, "The Company generated almost $50 million in net cash flow from operating activities during the first quarter despite the slow growth economic environment in which we operate, continuing to provide a clear view of our strategic position and financial strength of the business." On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." The Company reclassified all costs incurred for shipping and handling from a reduction of net sales to cost of sales for the periods reflected herein. The presentation of prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company plans to file an amendment to its Form 10-K for the year 2002. This change does not have an effect on gross profit, operating profit or net income. Shipping and handling costs reclassified totaled $8,352 and $7,194 for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Some of the information presented in the following communication may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, which are in turn based on the Company's reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the timing of orders received from customers, the gain or loss of significant customers, competition from other manufacturers, changes in the demand for the Company's products, increases in the cost of products, increases in the cost of energy and raw materials (notably, ethylene, chlorine and natural gas), changes in the Company's markets in general, fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in new product introductions resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending, changes in laws and regulations, unanticipated claims or litigation, the inability to obtain current levels of product or premises liability insurance or the denial of such coverage, political unrest affecting the global economy and changes in accounting standards. The Company assumes no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. A more comprehensive discussion of the Company's performance will be available on Albemarle's Web Page at www.albemarle.com on April 23, following a conference call at 3 PM Eastern daylight time. Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading producer of specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; pharmaceuticals; agricultural, automotive and industrial products; and construction and packaging materials. The company's two business segments, Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals - which includes custom manufacturing services for the life sciences market - serve customers in more than 40 countries, generating annual revenue of approximately $1 billion.

1 Sarah McCoy 804.788.6091 Michael Whitlow 804.788.6091 Albemarle Corporation To Acquire Phosphorus Flame Retardants in Agreement with Rhodia SA Richmond, Va., June 17, 2003 - Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) and Rhodia SA (Paris) have reached an agreement for Albemarle to acquire Rhodia's global organo-phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate flame retardants business for applications in rigid and flexible polyurethane foams. Annual global revenue for these products is approximately $65 million. The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the next three to six weeks, is subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the transaction, Albemarle will acquire Rhodia's production site in Avonmouth, United Kingdom. Rhodia also will supply Albemarle with Antiblaze(TM) flame retardants and intermediates from its plants in Charleston, S.C., and Oldbury and Widnes in the United Kingdom. "This acquisition significantly strengthens Albemarle's position in polyurethane foam applications," said Luc Van Muylem, global business director for flame retardants at Albemarle. "The Antiblaze flame retardant product portfolio allows Albemarle to be a significant provider of flame retardants for the polyurethane foam industry as our customers are developing products to meet the challenges of safer furniture and other products. It also complements the NcendX(TM) phosphorus-based flame retardants capability Albemarle has developed for thermoplastic applications, such as electronic enclosures." Albemarle has established global leadership positions in bromine-based and mineral flame retardants. "With the addition of the new phosphorus capabilities, our offering is unmatched by anyone in the industry. We are combining versatility of our product and technology portfolio, with excellent geographical positioning and scale of our production bases, as well as strong global technical application support capabilities," said Van Muylem. Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading producer of specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; pharmaceuticals; agricultural, automotive and industrial products; and construction and packaging materials.

4 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. 99.1 Albemarle Corporation press release dated July 23, 2003.

1 Immediate Release Michael Whitlow (225) 388-7320 Sarah McCoy (804) 788-6091 Richmond, Virginia, July 23, 2003 -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) reported second-quarter 2003 net income of $22.6 million, or 54 cents per share on a diluted basis. The earnings include a 16 cents per diluted share benefit due to the reversal of income tax reserves as the Internal Revenue Service closed audits related to certain tax years. After an adjustment for this item, the Company's diluted earnings per share for second-quarter 2003 was 38 cents, or $16.0 Million. Second-quarter 2002 earnings were $16.9 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, excluding a favorable Federal income tax settlement of $3.8 million. Results for second-quarter 2003 reflect higher net sales, up 6.6 percent versus second-quarter 2002, or $16.8 million, due primarily to the favorable effects of foreign exchange in Europe and the positive contribution made by the addition of the fuel and lube additives products that were acquired in mid-January 2003, offset in part by lower shipments of brominated flame retardants and certain performance chemicals products. On a year-to-year comparison, the second-quarter 2003 margin percentages are down slightly due to higher energy and raw material costs. For the first six months of 2003, net income amounted to $43.6 million, up 16.2 percent from $37.5 million for the first six months of 2002, while diluted earnings per share were $1.03 per share for the first six months of 2003, up 19.8 percent from 86 cents per share for the same period in 2002. Excluding the impact of income tax settlements, tax reserve adjustments and a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle related to SFAS No. 143 (five cents per diluted share), earnings for the first six months were 76 cents per diluted share compared to 78 cents per diluted share in 2002. Sales for the first six months of 2003 were $535.0 million, up $50.5 million or approximately 10 percent over the first six months of 2002. The increase in sales was primarily due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange in Europe and the positive contribution made by the addition of the fuel and lube additives products that were acquired in mid-January 2003 from Ethyl Corporation. Average common shares used to compute second-quarter and six months 2003 diluted earnings per share were 42,046,000 and 42,166,000 down from 42,822,000 and 43,506,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2002, primarily reflecting the effects of the Company's repurchase of its common shares in both February 2003 and 2002.
2 Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, commented, "Overall we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter despite the difficult economic environment in which we operate. We have programs in place to improve profit margins and help offset higher raw material and energy costs. Our underlying performance was enhanced by our efforts to grow through new business development, recent acquisitions and good fixed cost control."

Sarah McCoy 804.788.6091 Michael Whitlow 804.788.6116 Albemarle Completes Acquistion of Rhodia's Polyurethane Flame Retardants Business Richmond, Va., July 24, 2003 - Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) has completed the acquisition of the phosphorus-based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of Rhodia. These products are used in rigid and flexible polyurethane foam applications. Albemarle has also acquired Rhodia's ammonium polyphosphate product range, which has applications in textiles, timber and coatings. This addition to Albemarle's polymer business segment is expected to generate sales of about $65 million in its first year. Albemarle is acquiring a production site in Avonmouth in the United Kingdom, and will be supplied with flame retardants and intermediates manufactured at Rhodia's sites in Charleston S.C., and in Oldbury and Widnes in the United Kingdom. About 75 employees will join Albemarle as part of this transaction. "This is an important acquisition in our strategy to become the leading flame retardants supplier in the industry," said Luc Van Muylem, Albemarle's global business director. "With this extensive new offering in the polyurethane area to add to our portfolio, we are offering our global consumers the best value and performance in all major flame retardant technologies." According to Albemarle, the addition of the polyurethane flame retardants will greatly improve its ability to compete in the market for flame resistant furniture foams, an important safety issue receiving regulatory and legislative attention throughout the world. Furniture that complies with California Bureau of Home Furnishings Technical Bulletin 117 standards is being promoted by fire marshals and consumer groups in North America as one way to prevent death and injury in home fires. The acquisition also brings a range of "non-halogenated" flame retardants to the portfolio, an area of focus for Albemarle in recent product development and acquisitions. Albemarle has a strong, leadership position in both bromine-based and mineral-based flame retardants, with global marketing supported by cost efficient production. Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading producer of specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; pharmaceuticals; agricultural, automotive and industrial products; and construction and packaging materials. The company's two business segments, Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals -- which includes custom manufacturing services for the life sciences market -- serve customers in more than 80 countries, generating revenue of approximately $1 billion.

    99.1     Albemarle Corporation press release dated October 21, 2003.

Immediate Release Michael Whitlow (225) 388-7320 Sarah McCoy (804) 788-6091
        Richmond, Virginia, October 21, 2003 -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) reported third-quarter 2003 net income, excluding special items, of $14.7 million, or 35 cents per share on a diluted basis, down 28 and 27 percent, respectively, from third-quarter 2002 earnings of $20.4 million, or 48 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2003 special items include a voluntary workforce reduction charge of $4.8 million after income taxes or about 12 cents per diluted share and the finalization of certain income tax related adjustments. Net income for the third-quarter-ended September 30, 2003, including special items was $9.9 million or 23 cents per diluted share versus $20.4 million or 48 cents per share in 2002, respectively.
        Results for third-quarter 2003 reflect higher net sales, up two percent versus third-quarter 2002, or $4.8 million, due primarily to the contributions made by the Company's 2003 acquisitions and the favorable effects of foreign exchange in Europe. On a year-to-year comparison, the third-quarter 2003 gross margin percentage is down from last year, primarily due to higher raw material and energy costs, and product mix.
        For the first nine months of 2003, net income amounted to $53.4 million, down eight percent from $57.8 million for the first nine months of last year, while diluted earnings per share amounted to $1.27 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2003 compared to $1.34 per diluted share for the same period in 2002. This change in nine months results was primarily affected by higher raw material and energy costs, and product mix, offset in part by the favorable overall effects of foreign exchange. Nine months results also include the impact of the tax settlements and tax reserve adjustments (33 cents per diluted share), offset in part by the third quarter 2003 voluntary work force reduction charge (about 12 cents per diluted share) and a first quarter 2003 charge for the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle related to SFAS No. 143 (five cents per diluted share).
        Sales for the first nine months of 2003 were $811.6 million, up $55.4 million or approximately seven percent over the same period last year. The increase in sales was due primarily to the favorable effects of foreign exchange in Europe and to the contributions made by the Company's 2003 acquisitions.
        Average common shares used to compute third-quarter and nine months 2003 diluted earnings per share were 42,137,000 and 42,156,000, down from 42,796,000 and 43,270,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2002, primarily reflecting the effects of the Company's purchase of its common shares in both February 2003 and 2002.
        Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, commented, "In the third quarter, we continued to see the negative effect that higher raw materials and energy costs had on our margins, overcoming favorable lower costs, new products and acquisitions. Our sales from new products and accretive acquisitions are impressive, and we intend to continue working on the mature products to improve profitability while growing our businesses across the board. If we see some moderation in raw material and energy costs, we are hopeful that we will be able to return to a materially higher level of profitability."

There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the timing of orders received from customers, the gain or loss of significant customers, competition from other manufacturers, changes in the demand for the Company's products, increases in the cost of products, increases in the cost of energy and raw materials (notably, ethylene, chlorine and natural gas), changes in the Company's markets in general, fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in new product introductions resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending, changes in laws and regulations, unanticipated claims or litigation, the inability to obtain current levels of product or premises liability insurance or the denial of such coverage, political unrest affecting the global economy and changes in accounting standards. The Company assumes no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.

                99.1        Albemarle Corporation press release dated January 29, 2004.

Immediate Release Michael Whitlow (804) 788-6116 Sarah McCoy (804) 788-6091
        Richmond, Virginia, January 29, 2004  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth-quarter 2003 earnings of $18.4 million, or 44 cents per share on a diluted basis, excluding a 2003 special item of $1.6 million, after income taxes, or four cents per diluted share, related to real estate held for sale. Including the special item, Albemarle's net income was $16.8 million versus reported fourth-quarter 2002 net income of $16.9 million. Earnings per share amounted to 40 cents per diluted share for both periods.
        The company is engaged in a review of the timing of approximately $3.5 million of bill and hold transactions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 to determine whether recognition of this revenue should have been delayed until time of shipment. In that event, the fourth-quarter 2002 net sales and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by $3.5 million and four cents per share, respectively, and the net sales and diluted earnings per share for the first and second quarters of 2003 would be increased by $3.5 million and four cents per share, respectively.
        Fourth-quarter 2003 net sales were up 15.6 percent to $295 million, a $40 million increase over reported fourth-quarter 2002, due primarily to the contributions made by the company's 2003 acquisitions and the favorable effects of foreign exchange of $14.8 million, primarily in the European and Asia Pacific regions. Gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2003 was down from reported fourth-quarter 2002 due to higher raw material and energy costs, and product mix.
        Fourth-quarter 2003 net income favorable results include positive overall effects of foreign exchange, higher agricultural intermediates and flame retardant shipments and 2003 acquisitions, offset in part by higher raw materials costs, lower pharmaceutical and detergent builder volumes and higher energy costs compared to the reported fourth quarter of 2002.
        Net sales for the year 2003 were $1.1 billion, up $95.3 million or approximately nine percent over reported net sales for the year 2002. Of the increase in sales, $57 million was due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange, primarily in Europe, the sales of acquired companies and growth in flame retardant sales.
        Net income for 2003 amounted to $70.2 million, down six percent from the reported $74.7 million in 2002, while diluted earnings per share for 2003 were $1.67 per diluted share down about three percent from $1.73 per share reported in 2002. This change in the twelve-month results was driven by higher raw material and energy costs, the negative performance of detergent, paper, oilfield and polymer intermediates products, the effects of the regulated reduction in methyl bromide sales volumes, the favorable overall results of foreign exchange, and the contribution from acquisitions, partially offset the cost increases and sales declines of these products.
        Results for the year of 2003 also reflect the impact of tax settlements and tax reserve adjustments (33 cents per diluted share), offset in part by, a third-quarter 2003 voluntary work force reduction charge (12 cents per diluted share), a first-quarter 2003 charge for the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle related to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143 (five cents per diluted share) and the fourth-quarter 2003 special item, which related to a SFAS 144 charge for real estate held for sale (four cents per diluted share).
        Charges for work force reductions in 2002 were reported in the first and fourth quarters, and accounted for a reduction in earnings per diluted share of two cents. These work force reductions were more than offset by a second-quarter 2002 income tax refund of nine cents per diluted share.
        Average common shares used to compute fourth-quarter and 2003 diluted earnings per share were 42,113,000 and 42,146,000, down from 42,741,000 and 43,137,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2002, primarily reflecting the effects of purchases by the company of its common shares in 2003.
        Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation, commented, "We are pleased with the strong results of Polymer Chemicals in the fourth quarter, with volume increases in some key brominated and other flame retardants. We also are very pleased with the performance of our newly acquired businesses, which helped offset the pressures in certain of our business areas.
        "Foreign exchange helped us in the quarter and in the year, along with our acquisitions," Rohr said. "The growth of our base in Europe, evolution of our new products, further development of our bromine franchise and current hints of economic recovery are positive signs. They are opposed by continuing competition from Asia in fine chemicals and price erosion in some mature products. These conditions make our acquisition and new product efforts, successful to this point, even more important as we enter 2004."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Richmond, Va., April 19, 2004 - Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) announced today that it expects to complete an agreement with Akzo Nobel N.V. (NASDAQ: AKZOY) to acquire its catalyst business, a leader in the production of petroleum refining catalysts, for 625 million euros in cash, subject to the advice of Akzo Nobel's Works Council and the approval of regulatory authorities.
 
The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004, and management anticipates it will be immediately cash accretive and accretive to earnings in 2005.
 
The boards of directors of both Albemarle and Akzo Nobel have approved the agreement. Upon completion of the acquisition, Albemarle will be the world's largest producer of hydroprocessing catalysts (HPC) and the second largest producer of fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts.
 
The strategic acquisition of the catalyst business, which had 2003 sales totaling approximately 350 million euros, significantly broadens Albemarle's existing portfolio of catalyst products and service solutions and expands the global size and scope of Albemarle's business. Albemarle has been a leader in polyolefin catalysts for the industry for many years, and traces its history in the chemistries that support the catalyst industry back to the early 1950s in North America.
 
The proposed acquisition will provide Albemarle with a leading position in the $2 billion refinery segment of the $10 billion catalyst industry. The company already has a leadership position in the $2 billion segment that serves the plastics industry. Fluid cracking catalysts help break down heavy crude oil into gasoline and other lighter products. The hydroprocessing catalysts Albemarle plans to acquire are used to upgrade fuel quality. Both product areas are critical to refinery efficiency and to new clean fuel requirements. Other catalysts, such as those for isomerization and alkylation, are also marketed or under development.
 
Mark C. Rohr, president and chief executive officer of Albemarle, said, "The critical mass in catalysis represented by our proposed acquisition of the Akzo Nobel business provides a strong technology foundation, positioning us well for sustainable growth in the refinery market. Refiners are increasingly challenged to provide higher quality fuels, the market is globalizing, and we will have the technology and innovation capability to serve more than 750 refineries worldwide facing these issues."
 
Albemarle intends to operate the new business as a third segment, joining it with existing polymer chemical and fine chemical segments, moving its current catalysts products into the new division and incorporating other polymer additives and its flame retardants into a newly named Polymer Additives segment. "We are creating a model catalyst business," Rohr said, "by matching our recognized leadership in supplying the industry's next generation of plastics-improving catalysts with the refining catalyst capabilities of the Akzo Nobel team."
 
"This new segment will serve customers who are fundamental to the world economy," Rohr said, "giving us a stable, sustainable growth platform, complementary products and immediate productivity in the pairing of our very strong sales, manufacturing and research and development teams."
Hans Wijers, chairman of Akzo Nobel's board of management, said, "Catalysts is an excellent and innovative business manned by creative people making positive contributions to refinery efficiency and the reduction of emissions. We are confident that Albemarle will continue to develop the business."
 
The company has acquired six businesses over the past five years, and in 2003 these acquisitions accounted for 27 percent of Albemarle's net sales.
 
Production sites for FCC and HPC catalysts are in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Pasadena (Texas, United States). Chemical Processing Catalysts (CPC) are produced in Amsterdam. The business also has 50% owned, non-consolidated joint ventures in Brazil (FCC SA), Japan (Nippon Ketjen), and France (Eurecat, with affiliates in the US, Saudi Arabia and Italy). The catalyst business of Akzo Nobel has approximately 850 employees worldwide with an additional 550 employees in its joint ventures.
 
The transaction will be financed initially through a new senior credit facility and a bridge loan. Several financial institutions have provided funding commitments. Albemarle intends to design its permanent capital structure in order to obtain investment grade credit ratings. According to management, the combined entities will have strong cash flow that supports continued growth of the business, and Albemarle expects to continue its current dividend policies.
 
Banc of America Securities LLC and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. are acting as financial advisors to Albemarle in connection with the transaction and have provided financial commitments. Hunton & Williams LLP is acting as Albemarle's lead legal advisor.
 
Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading producer of specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; pharmaceuticals; agricultural, automotive and industrial products; and construction and packaging materials.

In accordance with General Instruction B.6 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report of Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto authorized.

Immediate Release

Richmond, Va., April 21  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first-quarter 2004 net income of $13.6 million, or 32 cents per share on a diluted basis. This item includes a special item related to a reduction in force of $2.9 million, after income taxes, or seven cents per diluted share. Excluding this special item, Albemarle's net income was $16.5 million in first quarter 2004 versus reported first-quarter 2003 net income of $16.7 million, excluding a tax refund and an adjustment related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes. Earnings per share on the same basis amounted to 39 cents per diluted share for both periods. See reconciliation below.
 
As required by Regulation G and related SEC reporting requirements, reconciliation of the material non-GAAP financial measures used in the company's most recent earnings release or in certain other public announcements by or on behalf of the Company and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables below. Certain amounts and percentages do not recalculate due to rounding. Please refer to Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on our website: www.Albemarle.com for a description of non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. Selected GAAP/Non-GAAP Reconciliation Data for the Periods Ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively:
 
 
First-quarter 2004 net sales were up over 20 percent to $322 million, a $55.3 million increase over reported first-quarter 2003 net sales, due primarily to the contributions made by the Company's 2003 acquisitions, volume growth in key products and foreign exchange.
 
The Company's gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2004 was down from reported first-quarter 2003 primarily due to the idling of the zeolite business assets, one-time costs associated with the acquisition of the Atofina bromine fine chemicals business and higher raw material costs. The one-time costs and excess zeolite cost negatively affected diluted earnings per share by four cents in the first quarter of 2004.
 
First-quarter 2004 results included higher flame retardant and agricultural product shipments, increased volumes in bromine and the positive overall effects of foreign exchange. These results were offset by lower zeolite volumes, higher raw materials costs and outside legal costs compared to the reported first quarter of 2003. The reduction in workforce at the Pasadena plant, brought about by the company's exit from the zeolite business, was the single largest factor offsetting the generally favorable results in the quarter.
 
Average common shares used to compute first-quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share were 42,200,000 down from 42,286,000 for the first quarter of 2003.
 
Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation, commented, "Our strong results in Polymer Chemicals were led by continued growth in mineral flame retardants and our recently acquired fuel and lube antioxidant products. On the Fine Chemicals side, our results were offset by the difficult decision to layoff employees in our zeolite product area, for which we have taken a charge."
 
Rohr said, "Strong performance in agricultural chemicals, intermediates, pharmaceuticals and bromine partially offset the downsides in other Fine Chemicals product lines, but weren't enough for us to post positive results in this segment. We continue to build our new product pipeline in this area to balance the declines in volume and pricing we are seeing due to product maturity and Asian competition. We are also very excited about the Akzo catalyst acquisition announced on Monday. The acquisition will add a new sustainable growth platform with complimentary products and productivity opportunities."
 
Some of the information presented in the accompanying communication may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, which are in turn based on the Company's reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's actual results will not
differ materially from the results and expectations in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the timing of orders received from customers, the gain or loss of significant customers, competition from other manufacturers, changes in the demand for the Company's products, increases in the cost of products, increases in the cost of energy and raw materials (notably ethylene, chlorine and natural gas), changes in the Company's markets in general, fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in new product introductions resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending, changes in laws and regulations, unanticipated claims or litigation, the inability to obtain current levels of product or premises liability insurance or the denial of such coverage, political unrest affecting the global economy and changes in accounting standards. The Company assumes no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.
 
A more comprehensive discussion of the Company's performance will be available on Albemarle's Web Page at on April 21, following a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.

Albemarle History
1887Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company opens with a handful of employees producing Kraft and blotting paper.
1921The antiknock properties of tetraethyl lead (TEL) as a gasoline additive are discovered after a lengthy search by a team of General Motors research chemists. TEL is to be the principal product of Ethyl Corporation for more than 40 years.
1942Ethyl Gasoline Corporation changes its name to Ethyl Corporation to characterize a broader interest than just gasoline products.
1962Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company borrows $200 million and purchases Ethyl Corporation (Delaware), a corporation 13 times its size, and Ethyl Corporation (Virginia) is formed. Floyd D. Gottwald becomes Chairman of the Board.
1976Ethyl leaves paper manufacturing with the sale of Oxford Paper. Ethyl opens a chemical plant in Feluy, Belgium to make aluminum alkyls.
1987Ethyl acquires Dow Chemical's bromine chemicals business and its Magnolia, Arkansas, plant.
1994Ethyl spins off its chemical businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation
1996Albemarle sells its alpha olefins, polyalphaolefins and synthetic alcohols businesses to Amoco for about $500 million.

Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure.
 
On July 16, 2004, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") entered into an International Share and Business Sale Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Akzo Nobel N.V. ("Akzo Nobel") pursuant to which the Company will acquire the catalyst business of Akzo Nobel for EURO 615.7 million (approximately $763 million) in cash.
 
The Company has received early termination with respect to the filings it made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in connection with the acquisition. In addition, the acquisition has been approved under the anticompetition laws of each foreign jurisdiction where such approval was required to complete the acquisition. Akzo Nobel has also received favorable advice from Works Council in the Netherlands. The Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close on July 31, 2004 or, in any event, by the end of the third quarter of 2004.
 
The Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

References to books, records or other information mean books, records or other information in any form including paper, electronically stored data, magnetic media, film and microfilm.
 
 
No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted against a Party solely as a result of the fact that such Party was responsible for the drafting of such provision.
 
 
In respect of any jurisdiction other than the Netherlands a reference to any Netherlands legal term shall be construed as a reference to the term or concept which most nearly corresponds to it in that jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller hereby, for itself and on behalf of the relevant members of Seller's Group, sells to Purchaser, who hereby purchases, the Intra-Group Claims.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Estimated Purchase Price and the Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with Schedule 11 (Part 1) and Seller shall (and shall procure that each relevant member of Seller's Group shall) and Purchaser shall (and shall procure that each relevant member of Purchaser's Group shall) adopt such allocation for all purposes, including in respect of Tax.
 
 
The consideration given under this Agreement in respect of the sale of the Businesses, the Shares and the Intra-Group Claims is exclusive of any VAT in respect of which the provisions of Schedule 12 shall apply. To the extent that VAT is chargeable then Purchaser shall (or shall procure that the relevant member of Purchaser's Group shall), against delivery of a valid VAT invoice (or equivalent, if any), in addition to any amount expressed under this Agreement to be payable by Purchaser (or relevant member of Purchaser's Group), pay to Seller (or relevant member of Seller's Group) such VAT in accordance with Schedule 12.
 
 
If any payment is made by Seller to Purchaser or by Purchaser to Seller in respect of any claim (i) for any breach of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a breach of a Seller's Warranty) or (ii) pursuant to an indemnity under this Agreement, the payment shall be made by way of adjustment of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated in Schedule 11 (Part 1) to the particular category of Business Asset or the Shares to which the payment and/or claim relates under this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be adjusted by the amount of such payment.
 
 
 
Subject to Clause 6.5 (relating to the possibility of having a deferred Closing in respect of JV Eurecat), Closing is conditional upon satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions precedent:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Between Signing and Closing, except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or as Purchaser shall otherwise consent to in writing in advance (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller covenants and agrees to use its best efforts to cause (in the case of the matters referred to in Clauses 5.1.2, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4) or to cause (in the case of the matters referred to in Clauses 5.1.1 through 5.1.20, excluding Clauses 5.1.2, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4), as the case may be, each Company and, with respect to any Business, the other relevant members of Seller's Group and, to the extent that any action set forth below must be approved or consented to by the relevant Share Seller, the Joint Ventures to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purchaser agrees that the limitations set out in Clause 5.1 shall not apply if the circumstances require, in the reasonable opinion of Seller (or relevant member of Seller's Group or relevant Joint Venture), immediate action and within 24 (twenty-four) hours after being requested in writing to do so Purchaser has either (i) failed to respond or (ii) refused to give its consent which refusal is unreasonable given the circumstances, it being agreed that Seller shall inform Purchaser of such action as soon as practicable thereafter.
 
 
Seller covenants that, except as expressly set out in this Agreement or otherwise agreed by the Parties, all existing agreements and arrangements (except for the Intra-Group Retained Agreements) between one or more members of Seller's Group (excluding the Companies) on the one hand and one or more Companies on the other hand shall be terminated prior to or at Closing to the extent related to the Operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to the Closing, subject to Seller having given its prior written consent in each instance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller shall use best efforts (i) to cause the Companies, Business Sellers and Joint Ventures to permit Purchaser and its representatives, at Purchaser's cost, to have access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to all Employees, management representatives, consultants, accountants, books, records, Properties, offices, warehouses and other facilities of the Group, subject to reasonable rules and regulations of Seller and the relevant Company, Business Seller or Joint Venture, as the case may be, and (ii) to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Purchaser, any financial and operating data and other information that is available with respect to the Group as Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably request. In connection with such access, Purchaser's representatives shall co-operate with representatives of Seller and shall use best efforts to minimise any disruption of the business of the Group.
 
 
 
 
 
Seller shall obtain a written waiver from Intercat, Inc. of any right it has under that certain Supply Agreement with Akzo Nobel Catalysts B.V. (relating to crystalline products to be used for the production of ZSM5) to terminate said agreement as a direct result of the Transaction.
 
 
Seller shall procure that, as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event at or prior to Closing, Akzo Nobel Catalysts B.V. transfer ownership of the land on which the PVS Site is situated, to another member of Seller's Group, at the cost of such other member of Seller's Group.
 
 
Seller shall procure that, as soon as reasonably possible after Signing, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. transfer to Akzo Nobel Catalysts LLC, ownership of 50% (fifty percent) of the vacant land owned as at the Signing Date by Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. and situated contiguous to the Pasadena Site (the ""), such transfer to be effected for a nominal amount and at the cost of Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc.

Title to those Shares, Business Assets and Intra-Group Claims transferred on Closing shall pass to Purchaser on Closing. The risk of loss or damage to the Shares, Business Assets and Intra-Group Claims shall pass to Purchaser as of Closing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The payment obligations of Seller and Purchaser under Clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 shall, to the extent possible, be aggregated and discharged by way of set-off.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purchaser hereby undertakes not to, and to procure that no member of Purchaser's Group (including the Companies) will, between Closing and the Effective Time, (i) take any action or allow any action to be taken by any of their respective employees, directors, officers or agents that would in any way prejudice or diminish the rights or duties of Seller under this Agreement, or (ii) omit to take any action to prevent any such prejudice or diminution.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purchaser hereby undertakes as follows in regard to dividends relating to the Joint Ventures:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to Clause 9.2 and the proviso to Clause 9.1.1, and save as otherwise provided in Seller's Warranties, Seller further represents and warrants to Purchaser that Seller's Warranties will be true and accurate at Closing as if they had been repeated at Closing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seller shall not be liable in respect of any claim under this Agreement with respect to any breach of a Seller's Warranty unless a notice of the claim is given by Purchaser to Seller specifying the matters set out in Clause 11.2:
 
 
 
 
provided that:
 
 
 
 
Neither Party shall be liable in respect of any individual claim (or a series of claims arising from identical facts) under an indemnity in this Agreement where the liability agreed or determined in respect of any such claim or series of claims does not exceed EUR 100,000 (one hundred thousand euro).
 
 
Neither Party shall be liable in respect of any claim under an indemnity in this Agreement unless the aggregate amount of all claims for which such Party would otherwise be liable under this Agreement, exceeds EUR 3,500,000 (three million five hundred thousand euro), provided that, to the extent that the aforesaid threshold is exceeded, the liability shall be calculated as the excess amount plus EUR 1,000,000 (one million euro).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without detracting from any applicable limitations of liability set out in this Agreement, any claim against Seller under this Agreement for a Loss in respect of any part of the Operations relating to a Joint Venture, shall be the greater of (i) the Loss directly incurred by the relevant member of Purchaser's Group (excluding the Joint Ventures), or (ii) the proportion to the relevant member of Seller's Group's percentage ownership in such Joint Venture immediately prior to Closing with respect to such Loss.
 
 
Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement in respect of any claim if and to the extent that any allowance, provision or reserve is made in a Working Capital Statement for the matter giving rise to the claim.
 
 
Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement in respect of any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof), to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement in respect of any claims to the extent of any corresponding Tax savings by the other Party or any other member of the other Party's Group arising in respect of such Losses or the facts giving rise to such Losses where the amount (if any) by which any Taxation for which the other Party or any other member of the other Party's Group would otherwise have been accountable or liable to be assessed is actually reduced or extinguished as a
 
result of the matter giving rise to such liability (after taking into account the amount of any increased Taxes incurred by such Party as a result of the accrual or receipt of any payments for such claims under this Agreement, including any incurred Taxes resulting from compensating such Party for any such increases).
 
 
Each Party shall procure that all commercially reasonable steps are taken and all commercially reasonable assistance is given to avoid or mitigate any Losses which might give rise to a liability in respect of any claim under this Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party under this Agreement more than once in respect of the same Losses suffered. Subject to any other limitations set out in this Agreement, in the event that any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof) giving rise to a breach of a Seller's Warranty or Purchaser's Warranty, as the case may be, is the subject of an indemnity under this Agreement (other than the indemnity contained in Clause 8.7.3(iv) or 8.7.4(ii), as the case may be), the claim for such breach shall be limited to a claim under said indemnity.

Richmond, Va., July 22  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second-quarter 2004 earnings of $21.1 million or 50 cents per share on a diluted basis, excluding a $.6 million pre-tax special charge, equivalent to approximately one cent per diluted share. Including the special item, Albemarle's second-quarter 2004 net income was $20.8 million or 49 cents per share on a diluted basis. See reconciliation below. Included in Albemarle's second-quarter 2004 results is $2.9 million of realized foreign exchange hedging gains ($1.8 million after income taxes, or four cents per share on a diluted basis) associated with the Company's planned acquisition of Akzo Nobel's refinery catalyst business.
 
Albemarle's earnings for second-quarter 2003 were $17.0 million or 40 cents per diluted share, excluding a 16 cents per diluted share benefit related to the reversal of income tax reserves for closed tax years. Including special items, Albemarle's second-quarter 2003 net income was $23.7 million or 56 cents per diluted share. See reconciliation below.
 
Second-quarter 2004 net sales of $326.8 million were up over 20 percent or $54.9 million over reported second-quarter 2003 net sales, due primarily to contributions made by the Company's 2003 acquisitions, volume growth in key flame retardant products and the effects of foreign exchange, offset in part due to withdrawal from the zeolite business in the 2004 first quarter.
 
Six-months' 2004 net income and diluted earnings per share were $37.6 million or 89 cents per diluted share in 2004 compared to $33.7 million or 80 cents per diluted share in 2003 excluding the impact of special items.Six-month 2004 results include $5.1 million ($3.2 million after income taxes or 8 cents per diluted share) in special items related to the closure of the zeolite business. Six-month 2003 results included the positive impact of income tax settlements and tax reserve adjustments totaling 33 cents per diluted share in addition to a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle related to SFAS No. 143 (five cents per diluted share). Including special items six-months' 2004 net income and diluted earnings per share were $34.4 million or 81 cents per share, down from $45.3 million or $1.07 per diluted share for the first six months of 2003.
Sales for the first six months of 2004 were $648.8 million, up $110.2 million or approximately 20 percent over the first six months of 2003. The increase in sales was primarily due to contributions made by the Company's 2003 acquisitions, volume growth in key flame retardant products and the effects of foreign exchange, offset in part due to the withdrawal from the zeolite business in the 2004 first quarter.
 
Average common shares used to compute second-quarter and six-months 2004 diluted earnings per share were 42,282,000 and 42,241,000 up from 42,046,000 and 42,166,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2003 due to the exercise of stock options.
 
As required by Regulation G and related SEC reporting requirements, reconciliation of the material non-GAAP financial measures used in the company's most recent earnings release or in certain other public announcements by or on behalf of the Company and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables below. Certain amounts and percentages do not recalculate due to rounding. Please refer to Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on our website: www.Albemarle.com for a description of non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. Selected GAAP/Non-GAAP Reconciliation Data for the Periods Ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively:
 
 
Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation, commented, "Polymer Chemicals prospects continue to improve with the recovering economy, and we are pleased with the volumes we are seeing in our business. Second-quarter 2004 represents the fourth consecutive quarter of record sales for this segment at a growth rate of close to 8% per quarter. Second quarter profit, up 33% from last year, was the highest in three years since the economic downturn hit in fourth-quarter 2000."
 
"In the Fine Chemicals segment," Rohr said, "our results are lower because of our first quarter decision to exit our zeolite business. Our team has done a very good job of repositioning the Fine Chemicals business, achieving sales at a similar level to last year's quarter. We continue to develop new products, and are excited about the prospects in our diverse fine chemicals portfolio."
 
The Company also announced on July 16 that it expects to complete the acquisition of Akzo Nobel's refinery catalyst business for 615.7 million euros (approximately $763 million) in cash on July 31, 2004 or, in any event, by the end of the third quarter of 2004. The acquisition will add a third catalyst segment to the polymer and fine chemicals segments Albemarle reports currently. The new segment will comprise about 30% of the Company's sales, polymer additives will account for approximately 40% and fine chemicals will provide about 30% of the sales following the acquisition.
 
Some of the information presented in the accompanying communication may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, which are in turn based on the Company's reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the timing of orders received from customers, the gain or loss of significant customers, competition from other manufacturers, changes in
the demand for the Company's products, increases in the cost of products, increases in the cost of energy and raw materials (notably ethylene, chlorine and natural gas), changes in the Company's markets in general, fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in new product introductions resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending, changes in laws and regulations, unanticipated claims or litigation, the inability to obtain current levels of product or premises liability insurance or the denial of such coverage, political unrest affecting the global economy, changes in accounting standards, the closing of the Akzo Nobel refinery catalyst acquisition and the successful integration of the refinery catalyst business into the Company's operations. The Company assumes no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.
 
A more comprehensive discussion of the Company's performance will be available on Albemarle's Web Page at on July 22, following a conference call at 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On July 31, 2004, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") completed its acquisition of the catalyst refinery business of Akzo Nobel N.V. ("Akzo Nobel") for EURO 615.7 million (approximately $763 million) in cash in accordance with the International Share and Business Sale Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and between the Company, Albemarle Catalysts International, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Albemarle Catalysts"), and Akzo Nobel. The nature and amount of consideration related to the acquisition were determined by arms-length negotiations between representatives of the Company and Akzo Nobel.
 
In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into (i) a Credit Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2004 (the "Multi-Year Credit Agreement"), among the Company, Albemarle Catalysts, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the banks named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, UBS Securities LLC, as Syndication Agent, and The Bank of New York, Fortis (USA) Finance LLC and SunTrust Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents, consisting of a $300 million revolving credit facility and a $450 million term loan facility and (ii) a 364-Day Loan Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2004 (the "364-Day Credit Agreement"), among the Company, Albemarle Catalysts, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the banks named therein, Banc of America Bridge LLC, as Administrative Agent, and UBS Securities LLC, as Syndication Agent, consisting of a $450 million term loan facility. The Company used the initial borrowings under the Multi-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement to consummate the acquisition, refinance its existing credit agreement and pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith.
 
The Company intends to operate the new business as a third segment, joining it with the Company's existing Polymer Chemical and Fine Chemical segments, moving its current catalysts products into the new division and incorporating other polymer additives and its flame retardants into a newly-named Polymer Additives segment.
 
The Purchase Agreement and the press release issued by the Company on August 2, 2004 announcing the completion of the acquisition are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 99.1, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

ALBEMARLE COMPLETES AKZO NOBEL REFINERY CATALYSTS ACQUISITION
 
RICHMOND, VA, August 2, 2004  Albemarle Corporation has completed the acquisition of the catalyst business of Akzo Nobel N.V. With this acquisition, Albemarle becomes one of the world's largest producers of hydro processing catalysts (HPC) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in the petroleum refining industry. Including joint ventures and Albemarle's current polyolefin catalyst business, the new Catalyst segment is expected to generate sales of roughly $680 million on an annual basis.
 
Mark C. Rohr, President and Chief Executive Officer of Albemarle said, " The addition of Akzo's catalyst business provides a new platform to broaden Albemarle's portfolio of specialty chemicals and service solutions, and expands our interaction with a global customer base that plays a key role in the world economy. We are impressed with the energy and talent our new employees bring to Albemarle, and we are confident we can create value by building on this strong marketing, manufacturing and technology leadership position."
 
Albemarle is acquiring production sites for HPC and FCC catalysts in Amsterdam and Pasadena, Texas. Additionally, Albemarle is acquiring 50 percent ownership of non-consolidated joint ventures in Brazil (FCC SA), Japan (Nippon Ketjen) and France (Eurecat, with affiliates in the US, Saudi Arabia and Italy). The transaction was financed through a new $1.2 billion senior credit facility and bridge loan.
 
Ray Hurley, Vice PresidentCatalysts, said, "I am very excited about the future, given the many strengths of Albemarle and the long-term commitment to the growth and success of our business.
Albemarle's core strengths will help us further enhance our current market leadership positions in the fastest growing catalyst segments, such as the rapidly expanding clean fuels catalyst market, and help us establish ourselves into segments of the catalyst industry where we are not currently active."
 
Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading producer of specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; transportation and industrial products; pharmaceuticals; agricultural products; construction and packaging materials. The company's three business segments, Polymer Additives, Catalysts and Fine Chemicals (which includes custom manufacturing services for the life sciences market) serve customers in more than 100 countries, generating annual revenue of approximately $1.75 billion.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action.

proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.

Akzo Nobel Catalysts (the "Company" or "Catalysts") is a business of Akzo Nobel N.V. ("Akzo Nobel"), which is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of fluidized and fixed-bed catalysts to refineries and petrochemical plants.
 
In September 2003, Akzo Nobel announced its intention to divest the Company, and began seeking offers for the purchase of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Catalysts. On April 19, 2004, Akzo Nobel received an offer from Albemarle Corporation ("Albemarle") for the purchase of its Catalysts business and proceeded to complete the transaction with Albemarle at the close of business on July 31, 2004.
 
The Company conducts business primarily in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.
 
 
These combined financial statements reflect the activities of Catalysts as managed by Akzo Nobel. These combined financial statements include the legal entities of Akzo Nobel Catalysts B.V., The Netherlands, Akzo Nobel Catalysts LLC, United States of America, Filtrol Corporation, United States of America, and the catalyst business of Akzo Nobel Chemicals Pte Ltd, Singapore, Asia. Additionally, these combined financial statements reflect the Company's non-controlling interests in the following associated companies: a 50% interest in Eurecat S.A., France ("Eurecat"); a 25% interest in Eurecat Inc., US ("Eurecat Inc.")  a 65% owned subsidiary of Eurecat; a 50% interest in Nippon Ketjen Co., Ltd., Japan ("Nippon Ketjen"); and a 50% interest in Fbrica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A., Brazil ("FCC").
 
These combined financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that were directly related to the Company as they were operated within Akzo Nobel. Additionally, these combined financial statements include allocations for various expenses, including corporate administrative expenses, as well as certain assets and liabilities historically maintained by Akzo Nobel and not recorded in the accounts of Catalysts. These include, among other things, corporate overhead, interest expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, liabilities for certain compensation plans, and contingent liabilities. Significant allocations are discussed in the following footnotes (Note 4, Note 15, and Note 16, for corporate expenses, interest expense, and pension and postretirement expenses, respectively). Akzo Nobel Catalysts management ("management") considers such allocations to have been made on a reasonable basis.
 
In June 2001, the Company closed its fluidized cracking catalyst production facility located in Los Angeles, California, with all production and technology for that site transferred to the Company's Pasadena, Texas facility. The remaining assets of the Los Angeles facility are not being included in the Company's sale to Albemarle; however, due to the Company's continued operational oversight post-shutdown for the periods of the financial statements presented, the assets, liabilities, and operational results of the Los Angeles facility have been reflected in these combined financial statements (Note 14).
 
Akzo Nobel uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its global operations, including Catalysts. As a result, indicative levels of cash and cash equivalents and debt of the Company were not determinable for purposes of the combined financial statements. The Combined Statements of Income include an allocation of Akzo Nobel's interest expense (Note 15). The Company's financing requirements are represented by cash transactions with Akzo Nobel and are reflected in Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities of Akzo Nobel such as employee benefit balances and current tax liabilities have not been allocated to the Company and are included in Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets; however, the expenses pertaining to these items have been reflected in the Combined Income Statements. Total Divisional

equity of Catalysts represents Akzo Nobel's historical equity on the Catalysts business and includes the Company's cumulative operating results, allocations from Akzo Nobel and settlement of intercompany transactions with Akzo Nobel.
 
The combined financial statements included herein may not necessarily be indicative of Catalysts' financial position, results of operations or cash flows, had the Company operated as a separate entity during the periods presented or for future periods.
 
All amounts included in these combined financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The Netherlands ("Dutch GAAP"), which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). See Note 23 for a description of the differences between Dutch GAAP and U.S. GAAP affecting Catalysts' Net income and Divisional equity.
 
All amounts are reflected in thousands of euros ("EURs") with the exception of per share data and headcount data.
 
 
A summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying combined financial statements is as follows:
 
Principles of combination
 
The combined financial statements include the accounts of Akzo Nobel Catalysts B.V., The Netherlands, Akzo Nobel Catalysts LLC, United States of America, Filtrol Corporation, United States of America, the catalyst business of Akzo Nobel Chemicals Pte Ltd, Singapore, Asia, and the Company's share of its non-controlling interest in its investments in associated companies. All significant intercompany transactions among these businesses have been eliminated. Transactions with Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries have not been eliminated.
 
Revenue recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met when finished products are shipped to the customers and both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, or services have been rendered and accepted.
 
For arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets, the Company accounts for these arrangements as separate units of accounting. These arrangements primarily consist of the delivery of catalyst products and providing limited technical service throughout the contractual arrangement.
 
For products for which a general right of return exists during a defined period, revenue recognition is determined based on the historical pattern of actual returns for that product and customer.
 
For products that include performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees, the Company defers the gross margin of the product, in accordance with Dutch GAAP, when testing or modeling results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be met. The deferral for performance guarantees is released over the term of the contractual guarantee period, while the deferral for life cycle guarantees is released over the term of the guarantee period in proportion to the amount by which the Company's future obligation is reduced.

Royalty income is recognized on an accrual basis and is reflected as Other income in the Combined Statements of Income.
 
Sales to other Akzo Nobel businesses are included in Net sales in the Combined Statements of Income (Note 4).
 
Property, plant and equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of depreciable assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. The Company's buildings are depreciated over a period of 40 years, leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the effective term of the lease, machinery and equipment is depreciated over a period of 10 years, and computer equipment is depreciated over a period of 3 years. All depreciation is on a straight-line basis. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense in the period incurred; replacements, renewals and betterments are capitalized.
 
Additionally, the Company capitalizes interest expense during construction of a new asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (Note 15).
 
Investments in associated companies
 
The Company's investments in associated companies, which are neither majority-owned nor controlled, are accounted for using the equity method. These investments are recorded at original cost and are adjusted for historical equity in investee net operating results, Company capital contributions, investee distributions, and other investee capital transactions.
 
Goodwill
 
Acquisitions of companies are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill represents excess of the purchase costs over the fair value of assets less liabilities of acquired companies. Effective January 1, 2001, goodwill has been capitalized at the acquisition date. Previously, goodwill was charged to Divisional equity. The aggregate amount of goodwill charged to Divisional equity at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was EUR 3,392.
 
Asset impairment
 
Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset with the discounted value of the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds this discounted cash flow value, an impairment charge for this excess is recognized.
 
Asset retirement obligations
 
The Company records the present value for future obligations to restore an asset to an agreed-upon stage at the completion of a contract if a legal or constructive obligation exists. The Company had asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2003, 2002, or 2001 for approximately EUR 99, EUR 120, and EUR 135, respectively, pertaining to closure costs of its Pasadena facility. As the Company does not intend on closing this facility, the discounted value of the obligation is nil.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in first out (FIFO) flow assumption. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead.
 
Accounts receivable
 
Accounts receivable are stated at face value less a provision for doubtful receivables, if deemed necessary.
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity dates of three months or less. As discussed in Note 2 and Note 4, during the periods covered by these combined financial statements, treasury activities at Akzo Nobel were generally centralized such that cash collections by Catalysts were automatically remitted to Akzo Nobel. Catalysts' reported cash and cash equivalents relate to local cash on hand or local cash in bank accounts of legal entities of Catalysts.
 
Fair value disclosure
 
The carrying value of receivables, prepaid expenses, and current liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
 
Environmental matters
 
Environmental expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Catalysts records a liability at the time when it is probable that the Company will be obligated to pay amounts and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Catalysts' estimated liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of the relevant costs. The estimated liability of the Company is not discounted or reduced for possible recoveries from insurance carriers.
 
Provisions
 
The Company accrues for provisions, including, among others, bonus and employee termination costs, in the period when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.
 
Contingencies
 
The Company accrues for contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of its businesses that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, environmental matters, contract and employment claims, product liability, and warranties, in the period when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Amounts are updated and accrued based on specific circumstances as applicable.
 
Research and development expenses
 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalized and amortized over a period not to exceed five years if the Company can demonstrate: the technical feasibility of completing the asset, the
 
Table of Contents
 
 
intention to complete the asset, the ability to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate future economic benefit. If these criteria are not met, development costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, no development costs were capitalized.
 
Software development expenses
 
Software development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Pension and postretirement benefits
 
As permitted by Dutch GAAP, the Company accounts for the costs of pension plans and postretirement benefits in accordance with U.S. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," respectively.
 
Pension and postretirement benefits are provided for substantially all employees of Catalysts under plans administered and sponsored by Akzo Nobel or one of its associated companies. Employees of Catalysts participate in Akzo Nobel's defined benefit pension plans and the assets and liabilities are combined with those related to other Akzo Nobel businesses. Similarly, Akzo Nobel manages its postretirement benefit plans on a combined basis with claims data and liability information related to Catalysts aggregated and combined, by plan, with those related to other Akzo Nobel businesses. As a result, no assets or liabilities are reflected on the Catalysts combined balance sheet; pension and postretirement expense for Catalysts has been determined on a multi-employer plan basis and is reflected in the results of operations (Note 16).
 
Income taxes
 
Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return, which includes Catalysts, in each applicable tax jurisdiction. The income tax provision included in these financial statements was calculated using a method consistent with a separate return basis, as if Catalysts was a separate taxpayer and the resulting current tax liability is settled with Akzo Nobel through Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets. Deferred income taxes were provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by the respective jurisdictional tax laws (Note 19).
 
Stock-based compensation
 
Certain Catalysts employees participate in Akzo Nobel's Employee Share Plan, whereby Akzo Nobel N.V. common shares are conditionally granted to the employees, subject to a vesting period. The Company expenses the cost of these common shares granted over the vesting period. In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the costs of the common shares granted prior to 2002 were not expensed.
 
Additionally, certain Catalysts employees participate in the Akzo Nobel Stock Option Plan. Stock compensation costs are charged to equity upon exercise of the stock option (Note 17).
 
Derivative instruments
 
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to sales to foreign customers. Recognition of gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are deferred until settlement of the foreign currency forward contract (Note 20).
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Foreign currency translation
 
Amounts in foreign currencies are translated into euros using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses. Differences arising from these translations are charged or credited directly to Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are restated into the local currency at prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with results arising from these translations reflected in the Combined Statements of Income as unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses.
 
The principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the Combined Balance Sheets and Combined Statements of Income are as follows:
 
 
Concentration of business risk
 
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable  trade are limited due to the geographical spread of the Company and the diversity of its customers. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition, monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses.
 
The Company's top five customers accounted for approximately 41%, 36%, and 40% of 2003, 2002 and 2001 net sales, respectively, and 14% and 31% of total accounts receivables  trade at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A single customer constituted 15%, 13%, and 10% of 2003, 2002, and 2001 net sales, respectively.
 
Additionally, the Company enters into long-term supply contracts for raw materials in the ordinary course of business. Certain of the Company's key raw materials have been subject to market volatility and limited supply in the past, and certain of these materials have seen sharp price increases over the past 18-24 months. However, management of the Company does not believe that these increases will have sustained adverse impacts on the Company's long-term financial position, although short-term fluctuations may arise.
 
Use of estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in The Netherlands requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent and other liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon currently available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
The combined financial statements include transactions with affiliated companies. Catalysts entered into transactions with Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries for the sale of inventory as well as corporate services provided by Akzo Nobel for the combined financial statement periods presented. Product transfers between Catalysts and Akzo Nobel were made at various transfer prices.

Sales to Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries represented approximately EUR 7,730, EUR 11,200 and EUR 11,190 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and are reported in Net Sales in the Combined Statements of Income.
 
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had receivables from Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries of EUR 4,190 and EUR 4,205, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Receivables on the Combined Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had payables to Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries of EUR 6,410 and EUR 7,521, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Current liabilities on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company had sales to its associated companies in the amount of EUR 8,820, EUR 11,525, and EUR 12,270, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had accounts receivable from associated companies of EUR 1,224 and EUR 1,872, respectively. These amounts are reflected in Receivables on the Combined Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had liabilities to associated companies of EUR 1,766 and EUR 665, respectively. These amounts are reflected in Current liabilities on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
Additionally, the Company had a note receivable from Eurecat. This note bears interest at variable rates (2.45% and 3.42% per annum for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively) and was due on April 29, 2004 (Note 22). Amounts outstanding under this note were EUR 2,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and are reflected as Other current assets on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had advances to employees in the amount of EUR 14 and EUR 7, respectively. These amounts are reflected as Other receivables in the Combined Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company guaranteed the mortgage for one employee in the amount of EUR 184. This guarantee is not for a director or officer of the Company.
 
Catalysts' General and administrative expenses includes allocated corporate and regional costs from Akzo Nobel totaling approximately EUR 4,282, EUR 4,549, and EUR 4,575 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. These costs are primarily related to Akzo Nobel's corporate administrative services to the Company and are generally allocated based on a combination of the ratio of Catalysts annual net sales, gross margin, and property, plant, and equipment, to Akzo Nobel's comparable consolidated net sales, gross margin, and property, plant, and equipment, as this methodology yields, in the opinion of management, a reasonable allocation. Corporate administrative expenses include accounting, treasury, finance, tax, human resources, legal, and certain other administrative services.
 
The Company's Combined Statements of Income include allocations of Akzo Nobel's interest expense totaling EUR 3,716, EUR 5,926, and EUR 9,965, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. These costs are primarily related to Akzo Nobel's consolidated interest expense and are allocated principally based on the average outstanding cash balance funded to Catalysts through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts using Akzo Nobel's weighted average borrowing rate (Note 15). While interest expense has been allocated, there has been no allocation of Akzo Nobel's general corporate debt in the accompanying combined balance sheet as all financing transactions with Akzo Nobel are settled via Divisional equity. There is no debt specific to Catalysts.
 
Akzo Nobel N.V. uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations. During the periods covered by these combined financial statements, cash deposits were remitted to Akzo Nobel on a regular basis and are reflected within Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets. Similarly, Catalysts' cash disbursements were funded through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts. As a result, none of Akzo Nobel's cash, cash equivalents or liabilities pertaining to book overdrafts has been allocated to Catalysts in the combined financial statements.

The Company has 50% non-controlling interests in Eurecat, Nippon Ketjen, and FCC, as well as a 25% non-controlling interest in Eurecat Inc.
 
Activity of the Investment in associated companies balance on the Combined Balance Sheets in 2001, 2002, and 2003 is as follows:
 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company's withholding tax expense on dividends received from its associated companies was EUR 62, EUR 543, and EUR 230, respectively. These amounts are included in Income taxes on the Combined Statements of Income.
 
In 2002, FCC repurchased the stock of one investor's 20% ownership and, as such, both Catalysts and the other remaining investor's non-controlling interests in FCC increased from 40% to 50%. Additionally, as a result of this transaction, the Company's investment in associated companies decreased by EUR 2,249 and is reflected as "other" in the table above. As FCC acquired the investor's 20% ownership at an amount in excess of the net asset value of the acquired investor's ownership, the Company charged this excess of EUR 2,249 against Divisional equity.
 
In 2003, the partners of FCC agreed that no dividends be declared or paid from 2003 earnings in anticipation of capital expansion activities planned during 2004 and 2005. FCC intends to finance this expansion activity through third party loans which could impact future dividend capability of this associated company.
 
Additionally, 2004 earnings of the associated companies are subject to defined distribution allocations as prescribed in the business sale agreement between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle.

As required by Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, limitations have been implemented to control the NOx emissions from industrial companies. Because the Company's operations at its Los Angeles facility ceased, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company was able to sell portions of its NOx allowances for EUR 367, EUR 305 and EUR 1,400, respectively. In addition, during 2004, the Company sold its remaining NOx allowance for proceeds of EUR 671.
 
 
During 1999, the Company committed to close its Los Angeles operating plant to align its cost structure with ongoing economic conditions, facilitated by a plan to integrate certain functions performed at that site with the Pasadena, Texas plant. In June of 2001, the Company closed its Los Angeles facility and all production and technology was transferred to the Company's Pasadena site.
 
As of December 31, 1999, the Company reported a liability for the costs of employee termination benefits and other exit plan costs. As disclosed in Note 11, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company's remaining obligation pertaining to these activities was EUR 610 and EUR 1,142, respectively. Additionally, during 2002, as a result of the Los Angeles facility not being sold, the Company recorded an additional charge of EUR 1,317 for other employee termination and severance benefits and continuing costs.
 
The remaining assets and liabilities of the Los Angeles facility were not offered for sale by Akzo Nobel; however, they have been reflected in the combined financial statements due to continuing operational oversight by Catalysts' management. The assets that were not offered for sale by Akzo Nobel primarily consist of land with a book value of EUR 5,887 and EUR 7,096 at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively (as adjusted for foreign currency translation). Liabilities that are being assumed by Akzo Nobel primarily consist of termination benefits and severance costs and exit costs pertaining to the closing of the Los Angeles facility; and have a book value of EUR 610 and EUR 1,142 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest allocated from Akzo Nobel, less amounts capitalized as follows:
 
 
Interest allocations from Akzo Nobel are allocated principally based on the average outstanding cash balance funded to Catalysts through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts using Akzo Nobel's weighted average borrowing rate of 3.73%, 3.97%, and 5.60% for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
 
 
During the periods covered by these combined financial statements, substantially all employees of Catalysts were participants in various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans administered and sponsored by Akzo Nobel. Benefits under the pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The postretirement plans provide associates with health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement. As discussed in Note 3, these combined financial statements reflect the plans on a multi-employer basis. As such, Akzo Nobel allocated costs associated with the pension plans to Catalysts based upon a ratio of age-weighted pensionable income for service costs and allocates costs associated with other components of pension expense, such as interest costs, amortization of actuarial gains/losses, etc., based on projected benefit obligations relative to the total projected benefit obligation of the plans. Management of the Company believes this methodology is a reasonable basis of allocation. Additionally, Akzo Nobel allocated costs associated with the postretirement plans based upon a ratio of Catalysts active headcount to total active headcount. Management of the Company believes that a headcount ratio is a reasonable basis of allocation for postretirement benefit plans and is appropriate since the benefit is not linked to salary.
 
The following table presents the allocated expense from Akzo Nobel for the Catalysts' employees participating in Akzo Nobel pension and postretirement plans:
 
 
Additionally, substantially all employees of Catalysts were eligible to participate in one of Akzo Nobel's savings plans. Under these plans, employees elect to contribute a percentage of their pay. The plans provide for Akzo Nobel matching these contributions (up to a maximum percentage of the employee's annual pay, as outlined in the plan agreement). The allocated expense from Akzo Nobel related to Catalysts participants was EUR 667, EUR 806, and EUR 758, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the business sale agreement, Akzo Nobel shall retain all liabilities for any retiree medical plan for all employees who are retired as of the closing of the sale of Catalysts. In addition, Akzo Nobel will provide a retiree medical program to all employees in The Netherlands who retire within the period of five years from the closing of the sale of Catalysts, and will also provide these benefits to eligible employees in the United States aged 50 and older (as of July 31, 2004) with ten or more years service, and aged 65 and older (as of July 31, 2004) with five or more years of service.
 
 
Akzo Nobel sponsors the following stock options plans in which certain employees of Catalysts participated.
 
Stock Option Plan
 
Akzo Nobel grants options to all members of the Board of Management, Senior Vice Presidents and Executives. Stock options granted during 1999 and onwards are exercisable after three years. The options for Senior Vice Presidents and Executives expire after five years, while options granted from 2002 expire after seven years.
 
Stock-based compensation activity pertaining to Catalysts' employees who participated in the Akzo Nobel Stock Option Plan is as follows:
 
 
At December 31, 2003, the range of exercise prices and the weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding options was EUR 19.51  EUR 46.75 and 4.37 years, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the number of options exercisable was 23,160 and 10,400, respectively, and the weighted average exercise price of those options was EUR 43.78 and EUR 42.50, respectively.

Employee Share Plan
 
In 2001, Akzo Nobel introduced the Akzo Nobel Employee Share Plan, whereby Akzo Nobel N.V. common shares are granted to the employees. Generally, these rights vest if the employee has remained in Akzo Nobel's service for a period of three years. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, rights for 3,272, 4,060 and 5,268 common shares, respectively, were granted to Catalysts employees. The Company has recorded compensation expense of EUR 110, EUR 50, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
 
In November 2003, the Board of Management decided to accelerate the settlement of this plan whereby the rights for all shares granted will become vested as of May 1, 2004. This event triggered a new measurement date.
 
The obligation of any outstanding options will be assumed by Akzo Nobel; therefore, they will not be assumed by Albemarle Catalysts International, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Albemarle and the purchaser of Catalysts.
 
 
Catalysts is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of fluidized and fixed-bed catalysts to refineries and petrochemical plants.
 
For management purposes, the Company is organized on a worldwide basis and operates in one segment.
 
Although the Company is managed on a worldwide basis, it operates in three principal geographical areas of the world. The following shows the distribution of the Company's consolidated sales by geographical market, regardless of where the product was produced:

The Company has historically been a part of Akzo Nobel's global tax reporting structures and has not filed separate combined income tax returns solely for the Catalysts business. The Company's income tax provisions have been calculated for each period on a method consistent with a separate return basis, as if Catalysts were a separate taxpayer and the resulting current tax liability were settled with Akzo Nobel through Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
Income tax expense in The Netherlands and from foreign operations was as follows:
 
 
The difference between income tax expense computed at statutory rates in The Netherlands (34.5%, 34.5% and 35.0% for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively), and income tax expense provided on earnings is primarily the result of the effect of jurisdictional tax rate differences, primarily the United States.

Commitments
 
The Company enters into operating leases primarily for its facilities, vehicles, and machinery and equipment under varying terms and conditions.
 
Additionally, Catalysts incurs an annual rental expense for land in the amount of EUR 24. This rental expense is related to a long-term land lease ("erfpacht") in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This lease forms part of the site on which the Amsterdam production facilities are located.
 
At December 31, 2003, future minimum rental payments under operating leases were:
 
 
The Company enters into agreements to purchase natural gas and electricity. These contracts contain no minimum purchase requirements and the contract price is indexed to the market value of the commodity. The fair value of these commodity contracts are not reflected on the Combined Balance Sheets as the contracts are not considered financial instruments.
 
Additionally, the Company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts. The purpose of Catalysts foreign currency activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
 
Recognition of gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts is deferred until settlement of the foreign currency forward contract. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, outstanding forward exchange contracts amounted to EUR 2,368 and EUR 3,910, respectively. These contracts mainly relate to U.S. dollars, Singapore dollars, and Japanese yen.
 
Additionally, FCC has a note payable due to a third party bank institution amounting to EUR 2,799 and EUR 4,892, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for which the Company has undertaken that for as long as the note payable is outstanding, Catalysts will maintain directly or indirectly a participation of at least 33.5% of FCC's common voting share capital.
 
Contingent Liabilities
 
Workers' Compensation
 
Catalysts recorded liabilities totaling EUR 248 and EUR 160, for anticipated costs related to workers' compensation at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported, as substantially all workers' compensation at Catalysts is self-insured through Akzo Nobel. These estimates are based on Catalysts assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of Catalysts' ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates.

Performance and Life Cycle Guarantees and Warranty Provisions
 
Provisions are recorded for performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees. These guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon. Performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered catalyst must meet, such as yield and product quality. Life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered catalysts is guaranteed. When either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon, an assessment of the need for a provision is made by management. When testing or modeling results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be met, provisions are recorded for the gross margin of the product. The performance guarantee provisions are released over the term of the contractual guarantee period while the deferral for life cycle guarantee is released over the term of the guarantee period in proportion to the amount by which the Company's future obligation is reduced.
 
Catalysts recorded provisions totaling EUR 5,990 and EUR 12,675, for such guarantees at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets (Note 11). Of these amounts, EUR 5,990 and EUR 8,426, respectively, will be released or paid out within the next year upon the lapsing of the performance guarantee or life cycle guarantee period.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Catalysts recorded liabilities totaling EUR 2,930 and EUR 3,461, for anticipated costs related to environmental matters, primarily the remediation of hazardous substance cleanup, at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets (Note 11). The costs include legal and consulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post-remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid by Akzo Nobel over several years. The amount of Catalysts' ultimate liability with respect to these matters may be affected by several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation.
 
Of the amounts recorded by Catalysts as environmental provisions, anticipated costs related to remediation of hazardous substance cleanup at the Los Angeles facility amounted to EUR 2,582 and EUR 3,113, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, the Company has recorded EUR 348 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, pertaining to an environmental remediation at its Amsterdam facility at December 31, 2003 and 2002. As part of the sale of Catalysts, Akzo Nobel will assume all obligations that pertain to environmental matters of Catalysts as of the closing of the sale transaction and will indemnify the purchaser of Catalysts for such obligations.
 
Guarantees
 
The Company executes, through financial institutions, contracts with certain of its customers which serve as guarantees on product delivery and performance according to customer specifications that can cover both shipments on an individual basis as well as blanket coverage of multiple shipments under customer supply contracts. The financial coverage provided by these guarantees is typically based on a percentage on net sales value. At December 31, 2003 committed bank funds under these facilities amounted to EUR 1,534.
 
Also, the Company has provided a 100% guarantee on a certain operating loan of Eurecat Inc. The loan was established for its working capital needs. The Company's partner in Eurecat has executed a counter-guarantee for 50% of this loan, which effectively reduces the Company's guarantee share to 50%. The total balance of this loan at December 31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to EUR 1,764 and EUR 2,354, respectively.

Other
 
Catalysts is a party to various claims and litigation arising from the normal course of business, including environmental claims and product liability. The Company accrues for contingencies in the period when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts are reasonably estimable. While there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established accruals, management believes that such additional charges, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
The number of employees of Catalysts at December 31 is as follows:
 
 
 
On April 19, 2004, Akzo Nobel received an offer from Albemarle Corporation for the sale of its Catalysts business; and on July 31, 2004, Akzo Nobel completed the sale of Catalysts to Albemarle Corporation.
 
On April 29, 2004, the Company extended the maturity date of a note receivable due from Eurecat (Note 4). The balance outstanding as of September 30, 2004 was EUR 1,700.
 
On July 28, 2004, the Company settled a legal proceeding against another company for patent infringement, subject to final regulatory review and approval. This claim, with proceeds amounting to approximately EUR 1,500, will be to the benefit of Akzo Nobel and has been excluded from the business sale agreement of Catalysts between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle.
 
On September 4, 2004, the Company renewed its local operating permit agreements for its Amsterdam plant. The Company has committed to future defined capital expenditures pertaining to environmental requirements with respect to emissions to air and water. Future committed funds under these agreements over the next five years are anticipated to range from EUR 12,000 to EUR 16,000, depending on the ultimate requirements of the related environment agencies.
 
During 2004, Eurecat declared a dividend, which is payable to Catalysts in September of 2004. Under the business sale agreement of Catalysts between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle, the dividend declared in the amount of EUR 559 will be payable to Akzo Nobel.
 
 
The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP.

The Combined Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 prepared under Dutch GAAP complies with U.S. GAAP presentation.
 
The following statements summarize adjustments that reconcile Net income and Divisional equity from that reported under Dutch GAAP to that which would have been reported had U.S. GAAP been applied.
 
(a)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, for products that include performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees, management defers the gross margin of the product when testing or modeling results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be met. The deferral for performance guarantees is released over the term of the contractual guarantee period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, SAB 104, revenue and the related costs should be deferred until the performance obligation period lapses. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced net income of EUR 827 and EUR 496, respectively, for U.S. GAAP purposes. Additionally, under Dutch GAAP, the Company has only deferred the gross margin associated with such products as opposed to deferring the revenue and costs as in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As such, under U.S. GAAP the Company would have deferred revenue and costs of sales of
 
Table of Contents
 
 
EUR 9,207 and EUR 4,163, respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and EUR 21,853 and EUR 11,596, respectively, as of December 31, 2002. Under U.S. GAAP, the impact on Divisional equity was a reduction of EUR 1,986 and EUR 1,159, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
In accordance with Dutch GAAP, Net sales is reported net of shipping costs and commission expense. Under U.S. GAAP, sales revenue should be reported gross with the shipping costs and commission expense reported in Cost of sales and Selling and distribution expenses, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, Net sales should be increased by 11,347 and 13,150, respectively; Cost of sales increased by 6,641 and 8,023, respectively; and Selling and distribution expenses increased by 4,706 and 5,127, respectively. This reclassification difference had no overall impact on net income for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
(b)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, recognition of gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are deferred until settlement of the foreign currency forward contract.
 
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments," as amended, was adopted by the Company in 2001. This Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires every derivative instrument to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company does not designate its derivatives for hedge accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.
 
(c)     Under Dutch GAAP, the Company expenses computer software development costs as incurred. Under U.S. GAAP, Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," requires that certain direct costs related to the development and implementation of internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation/operations stage (as defined in SOP 98-1) in an internal-use computer software development project should be expensed as incurred. The estimated average useful lives to amortize these capitalized costs are between 3 and 5 years.
 
(d)    The effect of applying U.S. GAAP to the Company's equity investees has been included in the Company's U.S. GAAP reconciliation. These differences primarily related to the adoption of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," capitalization of interest in accordance with SFAS 34, "Capitalization of Interest Costs," accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and inventory valuation.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation primarily applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. Pursuant to the issuance of FIN No. 46(R), an amendment to FIN No. 46, the implementation of FIN No. 46 has been deferred to the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. As such, the Company will implement the provisions of FIN No. 46(R) effective January 1, 2004. The Company has evaluated its relationships with its associated companies and believes that the adoption of FIN No. 46(R) will not have a significant impact on these combined financial statements.
 
(e)    On November 1, 2002, the Company's 40% owned associated company, FCC, executed a stock repurchase agreement with its 20% investor whereby the investor's entire interest in FCC was acquired for approximately EUR 8,500 and was funded through cash funds of FCC. The Company sold none of its interest in FCC in connection with this transaction.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the Company reflected this transaction as a reduction of investments in associated companies and a reduction of Divisional equity in the amount of EUR 2,249.
 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, when an investee buys treasury stock at a premium and an investor sells no shares pursuant to this transaction, that investor's ownership interest in the investee increases and gives rise to an adjustment of its share in the basis of the net assets of the investee. Such adjustment is to be assigned first to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and to liabilities, with any remaining difference to goodwill. For this transaction Catalysts recorded approximately EUR 2,400 in amortizable intangibles as a subdivision of its investment in FCC balance during 2002. Amortization expense recorded for this item amounted to EUR 143 and EUR 33 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
Additionally, during 1995, the Company acquired additional ownership in Eurecat and as a result, the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of EUR 1,101. In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the goodwill balance was recorded as a charge to Divisional equity. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, this goodwill was reflected as a subdivision of its investment in Eurecat and is amortized over a period of 40 years. Upon the adoption of the provision of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002, amortization of the goodwill balance ceased and the goodwill balance is tested annually or when impairment indicators exists for impairment. The Company has noted no impairment of this goodwill.
 
(f)    In 1989, the Company acquired a company and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company was reflected as a charge to equity under Dutch GAAP. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies should be reflected as goodwill. Upon the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, the goodwill balance should be tested at least on an annual basis for impairment.
 
The U.S. GAAP adjustment reverses the goodwill charged to equity under Dutch GAAP and reflects the unamortized portion of goodwill, assuming a useful life of 40 years; amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company performed an impairment analysis on this goodwill balance and noted no impairment.
 
(g)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the value of the shares granted under the Akzo Nobel Employee Share Plan on the date of the grant is recognized as a charge in the Combined Statements of Income spread over the vesting period. This standard is effective for rights granted from 2002 onwards. No charge was recognized for the shares granted under the Akzo Nobel Employee Share Plan in 2001. In accordance with U.S. GAAP the fair value of these shares granted in 2001 (i.e., the share price at the date of grant) also has to be recognized as a charge against income over the vesting period of the grant. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the additional charge amounted to EUR 81 and EUR 86, respectively. As a result of the above transaction, the Company has accrued compensation costs of EUR 239 and EUR 158 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively; and is reflected in Divisional equity.
 
Additionally, certain Catalysts employees participated in the Akzo Nobel Stock Option Plan. Under Dutch GAAP, stock compensation costs are charged to equity upon exercise of stock appreciation rights. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," under U.S. GAAP the Company has elected to apply APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based compensation plans. In accordance with APB No. 25, compensation costs, including the change in the liability for the difference between the exercise and market price at date of grant, should be recognized as an expense. Stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income due to the cash settlement feature of the Akzo Nobel stock option scheme, which causes the options to be remeasured at each reporting date. The Company recognized compensation income (expense) in the amount of EUR (79) and EUR 46, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Due to the cash settlement feature of this plan, the Company has

accrued compensation costs of EUR 79 and zero at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively; these amounts are reflected as Provisions.
 
(h)    Platinum is an essential component of certain catalyst products. The Company leases platinum from financial institutions and accounts for these leases as operating leases in accordance with Dutch GAAP. Catalysts' customers use the platinum in their manufacturing process and extract the platinum from the used product. At the end of the arrangement, the customer returns the same quantity of platinum (either from extraction or by purchasing from others) to Catalysts and Catalysts returns the platinum back to the financial institutions or pays for the platinum at its then current value. The financial institutions bear the risk and reward for the fluctuation of the change in market value of the platinum; however, the Company is obligated to return the same quantity of platinum leased.
 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, inventory, including precious metals, such as platinum, cannot be the subject of a lease for accounting purposes because those assets are not depreciable. The Company has evaluated these lease contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and determined that the lease arrangement is a financing transaction that contains an embedded derivative. The Company has bifurcated and marked-to-market the embedded derivative in accordance with SFAS No. 133. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized a favorable (unfavorable) mark-to-market adjustment of EUR (165) and EUR 451, respectively. Also, under U.S. GAAP, the Company has reflected the value of the platinum leased as inventory and has recorded a related obligation for amounts due to the financial institutions upon the maturity of the contractual arrangement. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company has recorded inventory of EUR 8,276 and EUR 8,025, respectively, and a related obligation for EUR 8,481 and EUR 8,065, respectively.
 
Additionally, in accordance with Dutch GAAP, the Company recorded the cost of platinum which the Company owned as property, plant, and equipment; however, under U.S. GAAP, platinum should be classified as inventory. The reclassification of such amounts was EUR 34 at December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
(i)    Under Dutch GAAP, the Company has reflected certain short-term liabilities as Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets. However, in instances where the performance and life cycle guarantee will lapse or the Company expects to pay out amounts within the next year, such amounts have been reclassified from Provisions to Current liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
(j)    The Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143") as of January 1, 2003. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred. The removal cost is initially capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset. The associated liability is accreted over the life of the underlying asset. Once the obligation is ultimately settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as income or loss on disposition. The assets are depreciated straight line over the remaining lives of the assets, while the interest component of the liability is accreted over the remaining lives of the assets. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 in the reconciliation of net income and divisional equity to U.S. GAAP is nil.
 
(k)    Under Dutch GAAP, certain indirect costs can be included as research and development costs. Under U.S. GAAP, indirect costs that are not clearly related to research and development activities shall not be included as research and development costs. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, General and administrative expenses should be increased by 1,643 and 1,697, respectively; and Research and development expenses should be decreased by 1,643 and 1,697, respectively. This reclassification difference had no overall impact on net income for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Akzo Nobel Catalysts Business
and the Board of Directors of
Albemarle Corporation
 
We have audited the combined balance sheets of Akzo Nobel Catalysts ("AN Catalysts Business"), a former business of Akzo Nobel N.V., as at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related combined statements of income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of AN Catalysts Business management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the Netherlands and the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the AN Catalysts Business as at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands.
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 23 to the combined financial statements.

Akzo Nobel Catalysts (the "Company" or "Catalysts") is a business of Akzo Nobel N.V. ("Akzo Nobel"), which is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of fluidized and fixed-bed catalysts to refineries and petrochemical plants.
 
In September 2003, Akzo Nobel announced its intention to divest the Company, and began seeking offers for the purchase of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Catalysts. On April 19, 2004, Akzo Nobel received an offer from Albemarle Corporation ("Albemarle") for the purchase of its Catalysts business and proceeded to complete the transaction with Albemarle at the close of business on July 31, 2004.
 
The Company conducts business primarily in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.
 
 
These unaudited condensed combined financial statements (the "combined financial statements") and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.
 
These combined financial statements reflect the activities of Catalysts as managed by Akzo Nobel. These combined financial statements include the legal entities of Akzo Nobel Catalysts B.V., The Netherlands, Akzo Nobel Catalysts LLC, United States of America, Filtrol Corporation, United States of America, and the catalyst business of Akzo Nobel Chemicals Pte Ltd, Singapore, Asia. Additionally, these combined financial statements reflect the Company's non-controlling interests in the following associated companies: a 50% interest in Eurecat S.A., France ("Eurecat"); a 25% interest in Eurecat Inc., US ("Eurecat Inc.")  a 65% owned subsidiary of Eurecat; a 50% interest in Nippon Ketjen Co., Ltd., Japan ("Nippon Ketjen"); and a 50% interest in Fbrica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A., Brazil ("FCC").
 
These combined financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that were directly related to the Company as they were operated within Akzo Nobel. Additionally, these combined financial statements include allocations for various expenses, including corporate administrative expenses, as well as certain assets and liabilities historically maintained by Akzo Nobel and not recorded in the accounts of Catalysts. These include, among other things, corporate overhead, interest expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, liabilities for certain compensation plans, and contingent liabilities. Significant allocations are discussed in the following footnotes (Note 4, Note 9, and Note 10, for corporate expenses, interest expense, and pension and postretirement expenses, respectively). Akzo Nobel Catalysts management ("management") considers such allocations to have been made on a reasonable basis.
 
In June 2001, the Company closed its fluidized cracking catalyst production facility located in Los Angeles, California, with all production and technology for that site transferred to the Company's Pasadena, Texas facility. The remaining assets of the Los Angeles facility are not being included in the Company's sale to Albemarle; however, due to the Company's continued operational oversight post-shutdown for the periods of the financial statements presented, the assets, liabilities, and operational results of the Los Angeles facility have been reflected in these combined financial statements.
 
The combined financial statements included herein may not necessarily be indicative of Catalysts' financial position, results of operations or cash flows, had the Company operated as a separate entity during the periods presented or for future periods.
 
 
 
All amounts included in these combined financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The Netherlands ("Dutch GAAP"), which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). See Note 15 for a description of the differences between Dutch GAAP and U.S. GAAP affecting Catalysts' Net income and Divisional equity.
 
All amounts are reflected in thousands of euros ("EURs").
 
 
The unaudited combined financial statements as of June 30, 2004 and for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the combined financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 except for as follows:
 
Interim Financial Information (Unaudited)
 
The financial information presented as of June 30, 2004, and for each of the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, this financial information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for such periods. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 should not be taken as indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the entire year.
 
Foreign currency translation
 
Amounts in foreign currencies are translated into euros using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses. Differences arising from these translations are charged or credited directly to Divisional equity on the unaudited condensed combined balance sheets (the "Combined Balance Sheets").
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are restated into the local currency at prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with results arising from these translations reflected in the unaudited condensed combined statements of income (the "Combined Statements of Income") as unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses.
 
The principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the Combined Balance Sheets and Combined Statements of Income are as follows:
 
 
 
The combined financial statements include transactions with affiliated companies. Catalysts entered into transactions with Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries for the sale of inventory as well as corporate services provided by Akzo Nobel. Product transfers between Catalysts and Akzo Nobel were made at various transfer prices.
 
 
 
Sales to Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries represented approximately EUR 3,800 and EUR 3,500 for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are reported in Net Sales in the Combined Statements of Income.
 
At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had receivables from Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries of EUR 3,670, and 4,190, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Receivables on the Combined Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had payables to Akzo Nobel and its subsidiaries of EUR 5,093, and EUR 6,410, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Current liabilities on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, the Company had sales to its associated companies in the amount of EUR 7,189 and EUR 3,890, respectively. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had accounts receivable from associated companies of EUR 1,649 and EUR 1,224, respectively. These amounts are reflected in Receivables on the Combined Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had liabilities to associated companies of EUR 712 and EUR 1,766, respectively. These amounts are reflected in Current liabilities on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
Additionally, the Company had a note receivable from Eurecat. This note bears interest at variable rates (2.31% and 2.71% per annum for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively) and was originally due on April 29, 2004, but a temporary extension was subsequently granted and is under current negotiation. Amounts outstanding under this note were EUR 1,700 and EUR 2,000 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, and are reflected as Other current assets on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had advances to employees in the amount of EUR 13 and EUR 14, respectively. These amounts are reflected as Other receivables in the Combined Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company guaranteed the mortgage for one employee in the amount of EUR 184. This guarantee is not for a director or officer of the Company.
 
Catalysts' General and administrative expenses includes allocated corporate and regional costs from Akzo Nobel totaling approximately EUR 2,141 and EUR 2,226 for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These costs are primarily related to Akzo Nobel's corporate administrative services to the Company and are generally allocated based on a combination of the ratio of Catalysts annual net sales, gross margin, and property, plant, and equipment, to Akzo Nobel's comparable consolidated net sales, gross margin, and property, plant, and equipment, as this methodology yields, in the opinion of management, a reasonable allocation. Corporate administrative expenses include accounting, treasury, finance, tax, human resources, legal, and certain other administrative services.
 
The Company's Combined Statements of Income include allocations of Akzo Nobel's interest expense totaling EUR 1,016 and EUR 1,992, for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These costs are primarily related to Akzo Nobel's consolidated interest expense and are allocated principally based on the average outstanding cash balance funded to Catalysts through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts using Akzo Nobel's weighted average borrowing rate (Note 9). While interest expense has been allocated, there has been no allocation of Akzo Nobel's general corporate debt in the accompanying combined balance sheet as all financing transactions with Akzo Nobel are settled via Divisional equity. There is no debt specific to Catalysts.
 
Akzo Nobel N.V. uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations. During the periods covered by these combined financial statements, cash deposits were remitted to Akzo Nobel on a regular basis and are reflected within Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets. Similarly, Catalysts' cash
 
 
 
disbursements are funded through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts. As a result, none of Akzo Nobel's cash, cash equivalents or liabilities pertaining to book overdrafts has been allocated to Catalysts in the combined financial statements.
 
 
The Company has 50% non-controlling interests in Eurecat, Nippon Ketjen, and FCC, as well as a 25% non-controlling interest in Eurecat Inc.
 
Activity of the Investment in associated companies balance on the Combined Balance Sheets through June 30, 2004 is as follows:
 
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company's withholding tax expense on dividends received from its associated companies was EUR 99 and EUR 62, respectively. These amounts are included in Income taxes in the Combined Statements of Income.
 
In 2003, the partners of FCC agreed that no dividends be declared or paid from 2003 earnings in anticipation of capital expansion activities planned during 2004 and 2005. FCC intends to finance this expansion activity through third party loans which could impact future dividend capability of this associated company.
 
During 2004, Eurecat declared a dividend, which is payable to Catalysts in September 2004. Under the business sale agreement of Catalysts between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle, the dividend declared in the amount of EUR 559 will be payable to Akzo Nobel.
 
Additionally, 2004 earnings of the associated companies are subject to defined distribution allocations as prescribed in the business sale agreement between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle.
 
 
 
 
Inventories consisted of the following:
 
 
The above total inventory amounts are net of a provision for obsolete inventory of EUR 2,214 and EUR 1,024 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.
 
 
Total Divisional equity of Catalysts represents Akzo Nobel's historical equity in the Catalysts business and includes the Company's cumulative operating results, accumulated translation differences on investments in associated companies and net assets in non-European locations, allocations from Akzo Nobel and settlement of intercompany transactions with Akzo Nobel.
 
Activity in Divisional equity for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:
 
 
At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the cumulative translation adjustment reflected in Divisional equity was EUR (32,860), and EUR (32,614), respectively. Note that in accordance with Dutch GAAP, prior to 2001, the Company was not required to disclose translation adjustments separately; therefore, the aforementioned amounts are cumulative commencing on January 1, 2001.
 
 
 
 
Provisions consisted of the following:
 
 
Movements in the provisions are specified as follows:
 
 
The "additions" and "releases" activity noted above for the performance guarantee provisions have been reflected in Net sales and the activity for the bonus, environmental, and restructuring provisions have been reflected in General and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income.
 
At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the above provisions consist of short-term liabilities of EUR 5,908 and EUR 6,600, respectively, as these amounts will be payable within the next twelve months.
 
 
 
 
Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest allocated from Akzo Nobel, less amounts capitalized as follows:
 
 
Interest allocations from Akzo Nobel are allocated principally based on the average outstanding cash balance funded to Catalysts through Akzo Nobel's cash accounts using Akzo Nobel's weighted average borrowing rate of 2.31% and 3.83% for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
 
During the periods covered by these combined financial statements, substantially all employees of Catalysts were participants in various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans administered and sponsored by Akzo Nobel. Benefits under the pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The postretirement plans provide associates with health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement. As discussed in Note 2, these combined financial statements reflect the plans on a multi-employer basis. As such, Akzo Nobel allocated costs associated with the pension plans to Catalysts based upon a ratio of age-weighted pensionable income for service costs and allocates costs associated with other components of pension expense, such as interest costs, amortization of actuarial gains/losses, etc., based on projected benefit obligations relative to the total projected benefit obligation of the plans. Management believes this methodology is a reasonable basis of allocation. Additionally, Akzo Nobel allocated costs associated with the postretirement plans based upon a ratio of Catalysts active headcount to total active headcount. Management believes that a headcount ratio is a reasonable basis of allocation for postretirement benefit plans and is appropriate since the benefit is not linked to salary.
 
The following table presents the allocated expense from Akzo Nobel for the Catalysts' employees participating in Akzo Nobel pension and postretirement plans:
 
 
Additionally, substantially all employees of Catalysts were eligible to participate in one of Akzo Nobel's savings plans. Under these plans, employees elect to contribute a percentage of their pay. The plans provide for Akzo Nobel matching these contributions (up to a maximum percentage of the employee's annual pay, as outlined in the plan agreement). The allocated expense from Akzo Nobel related to Catalysts participants was EUR 321 and EUR 334, for the six month period ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the business sale agreement, Akzo Nobel shall retain all liabilities for any retiree medical plan for all employees who are retired as of the closing of the sale of Catalysts. In addition, Akzo Nobel will provide a retiree medical program to all employees in The Netherlands who retire within the period of five years from the closing of the sale of Catalysts, and will also provide these benefits to eligible employees in the United States aged 50 and older (as of July 31, 2004) with ten or more years service, and aged 65 and older (as of July 31, 2004) with five or more years of service.
 
 
Catalysts is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of fluidized and fixed-bed catalysts to refineries and petrochemical plants.
 
For management purposes, the Company is organized on a worldwide basis and operates in one segment.
 
Although the Company is managed on a worldwide basis, they operate in three principal geographical areas of the world. The following shows the distribution of the Company's consolidated sales by geographical market, regardless of where the product was produced:
 
 
The following shows the carrying amount of segment assets and additions to property, plant, and equipment by geographical area in which the assets are located.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company has historically been a part of Akzo Nobel's global tax reporting structures and has not filed separate combined income tax returns solely for the Catalysts business. The Company's income tax provisions have been calculated for each period on a separate return basis, as if Catalysts were a separate taxpayer and the resulting current tax liability were settled with Akzo Nobel through Divisional equity on the Combined Balance Sheets.
 
Income tax expense in The Netherlands and from foreign operations was as follows:
 
 
The difference between income tax expenses computed at statutory rates in The Netherlands (34.5%), for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and income tax expense provided on earnings is primarily the result of the effect of jurisdictional tax rate differences, primarily the United States.
 
 
Commitments
 
The Company enters into operating leases primarily for its facilities, vehicles, and machinery and equipment under varying terms and conditions.
 
Additionally, Catalysts incurs an annual rental expense for land in the amount of EUR 24. This rental expense is related to a long-term land lease ("erfpacht") in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This lease forms part of the site on which the Amsterdam production facilities are located.
 
 
 
At June 30, 2004, future minimum rental payments under operating leases were:
 
 
The Company enters into agreements to purchase natural gas and electricity. These contracts contain no minimum purchase requirements and the contract price is indexed to the market value of the commodity. The fair value of these commodity contracts are not reflected on the Combined Balance Sheets as the contracts are not considered financial instruments.
 
Additionally, the Company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts. The purpose of Catalysts foreign currency activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
 
Recognition of gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts is deferred until settlement of the foreign currency forward contract. At June 30, 2004 and 2003, outstanding forward exchange contracts amounted to EUR 439 and EUR 2,515, respectively. These contracts mainly relate to U.S. dollars, Singapore dollars, and Japanese yen.
 
Additionally, FCC has a note payable due to a third party bank institution amounting to EUR 2,336 at June 30, 2004, for which the Company has undertaken that for as long as the note payable is outstanding, Catalysts will maintain directly or indirectly a participation of at least 33.5% of FCC's common voting share capital.
 
Contingent Liabilities
 
Workers' Compensation
 
Catalysts recorded liabilities totaling EUR 132 and EUR 248 for anticipated costs related to workers' compensation at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported as substantially all workers' compensation at Catalysts is self-insured through Akzo Nobel. These estimates are based on Catalysts assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of Catalysts' ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates.
 
Performance and Life Cycle Guarantees and Warranty Provisions
 
Provisions are recorded for performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees. These guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon. Performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered catalyst must meet, such as yield and product quality. Life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered catalysts is guaranteed. When either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon, an assessment of the need for a provision is made by management.
 
 
 
When testing or modeling results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be met, provisions are recorded for the gross margin of the product. The performance guarantee provisions are released over the term of the contractual guarantee period while the deferral for life cycle guarantee is released over the term of the guarantee period in proportion to the amount by which the Company's future obligation is reduced.
 
Catalysts recorded provisions totaling EUR 2,644 and EUR 5,990 for such guarantees at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets (Note 8). Of these amounts, EUR 2,644 and EUR 5,990, respectively will be released or paid out within the next year upon the lapsing of the performance guarantee or life cycle guarantee period.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Catalysts recorded liabilities totaling EUR 2,909 and EUR 2,930 for anticipated costs related to environmental matters, primarily the remediation of hazardous substance cleanup, at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively; these amounts are reflected in Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets (Note 8). The costs include legal and consulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post-remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid by Akzo Nobel over several years. The amount of Catalysts' ultimate liability with respect to these matters may be affected by several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation.
 
Of the amounts recorded by Catalysts as environmental provisions, anticipated costs related to remediation of hazardous substance cleanup at the Los Angeles facility amounted to EUR 2,561 and EUR 2,582, at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Additionally, the Company has recorded EUR 348 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, pertaining to an environmental remediation at its Amsterdam facility. As part of the sale of Catalysts, Akzo Nobel will assume all obligations that pertain to environmental matters of Catalysts as of the closing of the sale transaction and will indemnify the purchaser of Catalysts for such obligations.
 
Guarantees
 
The Company executes, through financial institutions, contracts with certain of its customers which serve as guarantees on product delivery and performance according to customer specifications that can cover both shipments on an individual basis as well as blanket coverage of multiple shipments under customer supply contracts. The financial coverage provided by these guarantees is typically based on a percentage on net sales value. At June 30, 2004 committed bank funds under these facilities amounted to EUR 3,560.
 
Also, the Company has provided a 100% guarantee on a loan of Eurecat Inc. The loan was established to assist with its working capital needs. The Company's partner in Eurecat has executed a counter-guarantee for 50% of this loan, which effectively reduces the Company's guarantee share to 50%. The total balance of this loan at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 amounted to EUR 1,764.
 
Other
 
Catalysts is a party to various claims and litigation arising from the normal course of business, including environmental claims and product liability. The Company accrues for contingencies in the period when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts are reasonably estimable. While there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established accruals, management believes that such additional charges, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
 
 
 
 
On July 28, 2004, the Company settled a legal proceeding against another company for patent infringement, subject to final regulatory review and approval. This claim, with proceeds amounting to approximately EUR 1,500, will be to the benefit of Akzo Nobel and has been excluded from the business sale agreement of Catalysts between Akzo Nobel and Albemarle.
 
On September 4, 2004, the Company renewed its local operating permit agreements for its Amsterdam plant. The Company has committed to future defined capital expenditures pertaining to environmental requirements with respect to emissions to air and water. Future committed funds under these agreements over the next five years are anticipated to range from EUR 12,000 to EUR 16,000, depending on the ultimate requirements of the related environment agencies.
 
 
The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP.
 
The effect of the application of U.S. GAAP on net income and divisional equity, as reported under Dutch GAAP, is set out in the tables below.
 
 
 
 
 
Comprehensive income is as follows:
 
 
The cumulative effects on significant balance sheet captions of differences between Dutch GAAP and U.S. GAAP are as follows:
 
 
 
 
The Combined Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 prepared under Dutch GAAP complies with U.S. GAAP.
 
The following statements summarize adjustments that reconcile Net income and Divisional equity from that reported under Dutch GAAP to that which would have been reported had U.S. GAAP been applied.
 
(a)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, for products that include performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees, management defers the gross margin of the product when testing or modeling results predict that the performance or life cycle criteria may not be met. The deferral for performance guarantees is released over the term of the contractual guarantee period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, SAB 104, revenue and the related costs should be deferred until the performance obligation period lapses. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 the Company increased net income EUR 1,969 and for the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company reduced net income EUR 1,017, for U.S. GAAP purposes. Additionally, under Dutch GAAP, the Company has only deferred the gross margin associated with such products as opposed to deferring the revenue and costs as in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As such, under U.S. GAAP the Company would have deferred revenue and costs of sales of EUR 4,570 and EUR 2,020, respectively, as of June 30, 2004. Under U.S. GAAP, the impact on Divisional equity was a reduction of EUR 17 and EUR 1,986, as of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.
 
In accordance with Dutch GAAP, Net sales is reported net of shipping costs and commission expense. Under U.S. GAAP, sales revenue should be reported gross with the shipping costs and commission expense reported in Cost of sales and Selling and distribution expenses, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, Net sales should be increased by 6,943 and 5,247, respectively; Cost of sales increased by 3,254 and 3,356, respectively; and Selling and distribution expenses increased by 3,689 and 1,891, respectively. This reclassification difference had no overall impact on net income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
(b)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, recognition of gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are deferred until settlement of the foreign currency forward contract.
 
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments," as amended, was adopted by the Company in 2001. This Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires every derivative instrument to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company does not designate its derivatives for hedge accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.
 
(c)    Under Dutch GAAP, the Company expenses computer software development costs as incurred. Under U.S. GAAP, Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," requires that certain direct costs related to the development and implementation of internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation/operations stage (as defined in SOP 98-1) in an internal-use computer software development project should be expensed as incurred. The estimated average useful lives to amortize these capitalized costs are between 3 and 5 years.
 
(d)    The effect of applying U.S. GAAP to the Company's equity investees has been included in the Company's U.S. GAAP reconciliation. These differences primarily related to the adoption of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," capitalization of interest in accordance with SFAS 34,
 
 
 
"Capitalization of Interest Costs," accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and inventory valuation.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation primarily applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. Pursuant to the issuance of FIN No. 46(R), an amendment to FIN No. 46, the implementation of FIN No. 46 has been deferred to the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. As such, the Company implemented the provisions of FIN No. 46(R) effective January 1, 2004. The Company has evaluated its relationships with its associated companies and the adoption of FIN No. 46(R) did not have an impact on these combined financial statements.
 
(e)    On November 1, 2002, the Company's 40% owned associated company, FCC, executed a stock repurchase agreement with its 20% investor whereby the investor's entire interest in FCC was acquired for approximately EUR 8,500 and was funded through cash funds of FCC. The Company sold none of its interest in FCC in connection with this transaction.
 
In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the Company reflected this transaction as a reduction of investments in associated companies and a reduction of Divisional equity in the amount of EUR 2,249.
 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, when an investee buys treasury stock at a premium and an investor sells no shares pursuant to this transaction, that investor's ownership interest in the investee increases and gives rise to an adjustment of its share in the basis of the net assets of the investee. Such adjustment is to be assigned first to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and to liabilities, with any remaining difference to goodwill. For this transaction Catalysts recorded approximately EUR 2,400 in amortizable intangibles as a subdivision of its investment in FCC balance during 2002. Amortization expense recorded for this item amounted to EUR 72 and EUR 72 for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Additionally, during 1995, the Company acquired additional ownership in Eurecat and as a result, the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of EUR 1,101. In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the goodwill balance was recorded as a charge to Divisional equity. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, this goodwill was reflected as a subdivision of its investment in Eurecat and is amortized over a period of 40 years. Upon the adoption of the provision of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002, amortization of the goodwill balance ceased and the goodwill balance is tested annually or when impairment indicators exists for impairment. The Company has noted no impairment of this goodwill.
 
(f)    In 1989, the Company acquired a company and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company was reflected as a charge to equity under Dutch GAAP. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies should be reflected as goodwill. Upon the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, the goodwill balance should be tested at least on an annual basis for impairment.
 
The U.S. GAAP adjustment reverses the goodwill charged to equity under Dutch GAAP and reflects the unamortized portion of goodwill, assuming a useful life of 40 years; amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company performed an impairment analysis on this goodwill balance and noted no impairment.
 
(g)    In accordance with Dutch GAAP, the value of the shares granted under the Akzo Nobel Employee Share Plan on the date of the grant is recognized as a charge in the Combined Statements of Income spread
 
 
 
over the vesting period. This standard is effective for rights granted from 2002 onwards. No charge was recognized for the shares granted under the Akzo Nobel Employee Share Plan in 2001. In accordance with U.S. GAAP the fair value of these shares granted in 2001 (i.e., the share price at the date of grant) also has to be recognized as a charge against income over the vesting period of the grant. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the additional charge amounted to EUR 19 and EUR 43, respectively. As a result of the above transaction, the Company has accrued compensation costs of EUR 258 and EUR 239 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively; and is reflected in Divisional equity.
 
Additionally, certain Catalysts employees participated in the Akzo Nobel Stock Option Plan. Under Dutch GAAP, stock compensation costs are charged to equity upon exercise of stock appreciation rights. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," under U.S. GAAP the Company has elected to apply APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based compensation plans. In accordance with APB No. 25, compensation costs, including the change in the liability for the difference between the exercise and market price at date of grant, should be recognized as an expense. Stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income due to the cash settlement feature of the Akzo Nobel stock option scheme, which causes the options to be remeasured at each reporting date. The Company recognized compensation expense in the amount of EUR 26 and EUR 8, for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Due to the cash settlement feature of this plan, the Company has accrued compensation costs of EUR 105 and EUR 79 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively; these amounts are reflected as Provisions.
 
(h)    Platinum is an essential component of certain catalyst products. The Company leases platinum from financial institutions and accounts for these leases as operating leases in accordance with Dutch GAAP. Catalysts' customers use the platinum in their manufacturing process and extract the platinum from the used product. At the end of the arrangement, the customer returns the same quantity of platinum (either from extraction or by purchasing from others) to Catalysts and Catalysts returns the platinum back to the financial institutions or pays for the platinum at its then current value. The financial institutions bear the risk and reward for the fluctuation of the change in market value of the platinum; however, the Company is obligated to return the same quantity of platinum leased.
 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, inventory, including precious metals, such as platinum, cannot be the subject of a lease for accounting purposes because those assets are not depreciable. The Company has evaluated these lease contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and determined that the lease arrangement is a financing transaction that contains an embedded derivative. The Company has bifurcated and marked-to-market the embedded derivative in accordance with SFAS No. 133. For the six months ended June 30 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized a favorable (unfavorable) mark-to-market adjustment of EUR 30 and EUR (110), respectively. Also, under U.S. GAAP, the Company has reflected the value of the platinum leased as inventory and has recorded a related obligation for amounts due to the financial institutions upon the maturity of the contractual arrangement. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company has recorded inventory of EUR 6,341 and EUR 8,276, respectively, and a related obligation for EUR 6,516 and EUR 8,481, respectively.
 
Additionally, in accordance with Dutch GAAP, the Company recorded the cost of platinum which the Company owned as property, plant, and equipment; however, under U.S. GAAP, platinum should be classified as inventory. The reclassification of such amounts was EUR 34 at June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003.
 
(i)    Under Dutch GAAP, the Company has reflected certain short-term liabilities as Provisions on the Combined Balance Sheets. However, in instances where the performance and life cycle guarantee will lapse
 
 
 
or the Company expects to release or pay out amounts within the next year, such amounts have been reclassified from Provisions to Current liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
(j)    The Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143") as of January 1, 2003. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred. The removal cost is initially capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset. The associated liability is accreted over the life of the underlying asset. Once the obligation is ultimately settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as income or loss on disposition. The assets are depreciated straight line over the remaining lives of the assets, while the interest component of the liability is accreted over the remaining lives of the assets. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 in the reconciliation of net income and divisional equity to U.S. GAAP is nil.
 
(k)    Under Dutch GAAP, certain indirect costs can be included as research and development costs. Under U.S. GAAP, indirect costs that are not clearly related to research and development activities shall not be included as research and development costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, General and administrative expenses should be increased by 937 and 743, respectively; and Research and development expenses should be decreased by 937 and 743, respectively. This reclassification difference had no overall impact on net income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.
 

Exhibit 99.4
 
 
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Albemarle Corporation ("Albemarle") and the historical combined financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V.'s refinery catalysts business ("Refinery Catalysts"), which Albemarle acquired on July 31, 2004, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with Albemarle's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2003 included in Albemarle's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and Albemarle's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 included in Albemarle's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004, and the audited combined financial statements and related notes of the Refinery Catalysts business for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the unaudited condensed combined financial statements and related notes of the Refinery Catalysts business for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, each included elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to (1) the acquisition of the Refinery Catalysts business and (2) the financing of the purchase price through borrowings of approximately $510 million under Albemarle's senior credit agreement and of $450 million under Albemarle's 364-day loan agreement, including amounts borrowed to refinance approximately $233 million outstanding under Albemarle's existing credit agreement and to pay related fees and expenses.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to the above transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2003, in the case of the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income, and at June 30, 2004, in the case of the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet. The acquisition of the Refinery Catalysts business has been accounted for as a purchase in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the preliminary estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of July 31, 2004. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair values of the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is subject to adjustment until it is finalized, which is expected to occur no later than the second quarter of 2005. Accordingly, the final purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on income from operations may differ from the pro forma amounts included in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not give effect to any working capital purchase price adjustment provided for in the sale agreement, the amount of which has not yet been finalized. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements presented below do not reflect any anticipated operating efficiencies or cost savings from the integration of the Refinery Catalysts business into Albemarle's business. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of income do not include the cumulative effect of the change in accounting resulting from Albemarle's adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" in 2003.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect pro forma adjustments that are described in the accompanying notes and are based on available information and certain assumptions Albemarle's management believes are reasonable, but are subject to change. Albemarle has made, in the opinion of management, all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma combined financial information. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not purport to represent what Albemarle's results of operations or financial position actually would have been had the acquisition and related transactions occurred on the dates indicated or to project Albemarle's financial position as of any future date or Albemarle's results of operations for any future period.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Albemarle Announces Filing of Shelf Registration Statement and Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock
 
RICHMOND, Va., October 13, 2004  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) today announced the filing of a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering $700 million of securities. The shelf registration statement will permit Albemarle to issue from time to time a range of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt.
 
The registration statement filed today also provides for a proposed offering of common stock in which Albemarle currently expects to seek net proceeds, after payment of underwriting discounts and expenses, of approximately $130 million (approximately $150 million if an over-allotment option expected to be granted to the underwriters is exercised in full). Albemarle intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to retire a corresponding portion of the indebtedness incurred under its 364-day bridge loan to finance its acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel N.V., which closed on July 31, 2004.
 
The registration statement also covers 1.6 million shares of common stock being registered for resale by a member of the family of F.D. Gottwald, Jr. and certain affiliates of the family, some of which may be included in the proposed offering. These 1.6 million shares represent approximately 18% of the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by Mr. Gottwald and his family. The selling shareholders will determine the number of shares to be included in the offering based on market conditions. Albemarle will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders.
 
It is expected that Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC will act as joint book running managers for the proposed offering.
 
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Offers for the securities will be made only by means of a prospectus forming part of the registration statement. When available, a prospectus relating to these securities can be obtained from Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. at (631) 254-7135, UBS Securities LLC at (212) 821-3000 or Banc of America Securities LLC at (646) 733-4166.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 28, 2004, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on October 28, 2004, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
 
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information about the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, including the Company's recent acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel on July 31, 2004, and, in doing so, improves transparency to investors and enhances period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report of Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Albemarle Announces Third-Quarter 2004 Results
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., October 28  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported net income for the third quarter of 2004, excluding special items, of $20.3 million, or 48 cents per diluted share. Special items totaling $19.5 million after income taxes, or 46 cents per diluted share, are outlined in the reconciliation below. Third-quarter 2003 net income, excluding special items, was $14.7 million, or 35 cents per diluted share. Special items for third-quarter 2003 totaling $4.9 million after income tax, or 12 cents per diluted share, are outlined in the reconciliation below. Including adjustments for special items, third-quarter 2004 net income was $0.8 million, or 2 cents per diluted share.
 
Excluding special items, net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $56.1 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $48.4 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003. Inclusive of special items, net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $35.2 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, versus $55.2 million, or $1.31 on the same basis, for the first nine months of 2003.
 
Net sales for the third quarter ending September 30, 2004, which included August and September results for the newly acquired refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel, were $413.9 million, compared with net sales of $276.6 million for the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of 2004, net sales were $1.06 billion as compared with $815.1 million in the same period of 2003.
 
Average common shares used to compute third-quarter and nine-months 2004 diluted earnings per share were 42,544,000 and 42,342,000, up slightly from 42,137,000 and 42,156,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2003, primarily due to the exercise of stock options.
 
The Company has reported net income and related per share amounts for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information that excludes the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, including the Company's recent acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel on July 31, 2004, and, in doing so, improves transparency to investors and enhances period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. See pages 14 and 15 for a complete reconciliation of reported results to GAAP.
 
Set forth below is select data related to our net income and related per share amounts for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. See pages 14 and 15 for a complete reconciliation of reported results to GAAP.
 
 
Quarterly Results
 
On July 31, 2004, the Company acquired the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel N.V. Following this acquisition, the Company transferred its existing polyolefin catalysts business from its Polymer Chemicals segment, which was renamed Polymer Additives, to a newly created Catalysts segment, which includes the assets the Company acquired from Akzo Nobel. The Company's operations are now managed and reported as three operating segments: Polymer Additives, Catalysts and Fine Chemicals.
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales, which now exclude the polyolefin catalyst business, were up 31.3 percent for third-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003, due to strong volume gains across flame retardants and plastic, fuel and lube additives, improved pricing on key products such as CP-2000 brominated flame retardants and mineral flame retardants, and the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Polymer Additives operating profit improved 72.4 percent to $24.3 million. Excluding special items, Polymer Additives operating profit improved by $3.7 million or 21.6 percent.
 
Catalysts segment net sales were up $85.8 million for third-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003, due primarily to the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business from Akzo Nobel. These net sales reflect refinery catalysts sales for August and September and polyolefin catalysts sales for the full three months. Catalysts operating loss was ($3.0 million). Excluding the initial purchase price adjustments for the step-up accounting values assigned to the acquired refinery catalysts business inventory totaling $13.4 million and the write-off of $3.0 million of acquired in-process research and development charges associated the acquisition, Catalysts operating profit was $13.4 million. The results were better than anticipated in both the refinery and polyolefins sectors due to growth in end markets, cost control, and strong demand for fuels.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales were up 6.4 percent for third-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003, driven by strong demand and improved pricing in bromine and derivatives, increased volume and improved product mix in the Fine Chemistry Services and Intermediates product area and the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Fine Chemicals operating profit was up 58.6 percent to $9.8 million compared to third-quarter 2003. Excluding special items, Fine Chemicals operating profit improved by $1.7 million or 20.6 percent.
 
Other income and expenses for the 2004 third quarter reflects additional acquisition-related charges of $15.7 million on contracts executed to hedge the purchase price for the refinery catalysts business.
 
Commenting on the 2004 third quarter results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, " We are pleased with the progress made in integrating the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel in the third quarter. We believe that these results show strong performance and that we are beginning to see benefits in supply chain and R&D activities. We believe that our heritage Albemarle business performed well in the face of significant headwinds in raw material and energy costs, in addition to the ongoing stranded costs of the zeolite business. Also, our price increase program is contributing to improved margins across each business segment versus one year ago."
 
The Company's performance for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 will be discussed on a conference call at 1:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on October 28, 2004, which can be accessed through Albemarle's Web Page at .

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 16, 2004, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") amended (the "Amendment") the Albemarle Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, a participant is permitted to defer up to 50% of his or her base salary and up to 100% of any bonus awarded, which amounts are then credited to the participant's retirement account. The Amendment permits a participant to elect to defer up to 100% of any performance based units awards that rely on the Company's 2004 and 2005 earnings during the Plan's 2004 election period. In addition, the Amendment establishes a benefit for each participant that will initially be credited with the number of phantom shares of the Company's common stock previously credited to the participant's account under the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan as of January 1, 2005. The Amendment further provides that this benefit will be increased each year by crediting a number of phantom shares of the Company's common stock equal in value to the Company's matching contribution that would have been available under the terms of the Albemarle Corporation Savings Plan but for the limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
A copy of the Amendment will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Albemarle Announces Preliminary Fourth-Quarter 2004 Results
 
RICHMOND, VA, January 6, 2005  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) announced that it expects to report net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 of approximately $16 million to $19 million, or 38 cents to 45 cents per diluted share. Expected net income includes a non-cash charge associated with a write-down of deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2004, which is expected to reduce the company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 by approximately $1.0 million. The company also indicated that it expects to report net sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 of approximately $435 million to $455 million. In addition, the company indicated that there was solid cash generation and continued debt reduction in the fourth quarter.
 
Albemarle indicated that strong sales volumes and increased selling prices during the fourth quarter failed to offset fully higher raw materials and energy costs. During 2004, Albemarle estimates that raw materials and energy costs, excluding metals, increased over $30 million, half of which occurred in the fourth quarter. In addition, in the Catalysts business, molybdenum prices increased from approximately $20 per pound at the beginning of the quarter to approximately $33 per pound at year end.
 
The foregoing preliminary results are subject to the completion of the company's customary quarterly financial closing and review procedures. Albemarle cautions that its final reported results could vary significantly from these preliminary results.
 
In 2005, the company currently expects to see margin improvement relative to margins in the fourth quarter, as well as continued growth in the business, solid cash flow and strong earnings, particularly in light of the company's success in increasing prices for products during the course of the fourth quarter. The company cautioned, however, that the foregoing outlook for 2005, like any outlook regarding future financial performance, is inherently subject to uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company's control. For a discussion of certain of the factors that may impact the company's future performance, please see the filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those discussed under "Risk Factors" in its latest Registration Statement on Form S-3.
 
Albemarle also announced that it currently anticipates reporting final results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 on February 3, 2005, at approximately 7:00 a.m. EST. The company anticipates hosting a conference call to discuss these results on February 3, 2005 at 1:00 p.m. EST.
 
Albemarle Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered specialty chemicals for consumer electronics; petroleum and petrochemical processing; transportation and industrial products; pharmaceuticals; agricultural products; construction and packaging materials. The Company operates in three business segments, Polymer Additives, Catalysts and Fine Chemicals, and serves customers in approximately 100 countries.

Albemarle Announces Common Stock and Debt Offerings
 
RICHMOND, VA, January 6, 2005  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) announced today that it intends to commence concurrent public offerings of 4,000,000 shares of its common stock (4,673,000 shares if the option granted by the company to the underwriters to cover over-allotments, if any, is fully exercised) and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. In addition, a member of the family of F.D. Gottwald, Jr. and certain affiliates of the family are offering up to 488,420 shares of the company's common stock, representing approximately 5% of the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by them. Albemarle will not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders.
 
The shares of common stock and notes will be offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The common stock and notes offerings will be conducted as separate public offerings by means of separate prospectus supplements. The completion of the common stock offering is not contingent on the completion of the notes offering, but the completion of the notes offering is contingent upon the completion of the common stock offering.
 
The notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. The maturity date of the notes is expected to occur in 2015.
 
The company intends to use the net proceeds from these offerings to repay substantially all of the $450 million 364-day bridge loan that the Company incurred in connection with its acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel N.V. To the extent that the proceeds from the offerings are insufficient to repay the 364-day bridge loan in full, then the company intends to pay the balance with borrowings from its revolving credit facility. The company expects to price the offerings the week of January 10, 2005.
 
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., UBS Securities LLC, and Banc of America Securities LLC are joint book-running managers for both offerings. BNY Capital Markets, Inc. and Fortis Securities LLC are co-managers for both offerings. In addition, First Analysis Securities Corporation is a co-manager for the common stock offering, and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., ABN AMRO Incorporated, Daiwa Securities SMBC Europe Limited, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lazard Frres & Co. LLC, and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC are co-managers for the notes offering.
 
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Offers for the securities will be made only by means of prospectus supplements forming

Inc., 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York ((631) 254-7135), UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York ((212) 821-3000), or Banc of America Securities LLC, 9 West 57

("Bear Stearns"), UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC are acting as representatives (together, the "Representatives"), in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares contemplated herein (the "Offering").
 
1. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
Representations and Warranties of the Company
 
(a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-119723), and amendments thereto, and related preliminary prospectuses, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the registration of certain securities (the "Shelf Securities") of the Company to be sold from time to time by the Company. Such registration statement, as so amended (including post-effective amendments, if any), has been declared effective by the Commission and copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Underwriters. The registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement." If the Company has filed or is required pursuant to the terms hereof to file a registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act registering additional shares of Common Stock (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, unless otherwise specified, any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. Other than a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, which, if filed, becomes effective upon filing, no other document with respect to the Registration Statement has heretofore been filed with the Commission. All of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement or, if any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement is filed, will be duly registered under the Securities Act with the filing of such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. Based on communications from the Commission, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of either the Registration Statement or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Company, if required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Exchange Act (defined below), the "Rules and Regulations"), proposes to file a prospectus supplement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act ("Rule 424(b)"). The prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Shares, in the form in which it is to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations (the "Prospectus Supplement"), along with the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement became effective (the "Base Prospectus"), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the Offering which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations), the term "Prospectus" shall also refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use. Any preliminary prospectus supplement or prospectus supplement subject to completion included in the Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act specifically relating to the Shares together with the Base Prospectus is hereafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference
 
herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include (i) the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, which is incorporated therein by reference and (ii) any such document so filed. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
 
(b) At the time of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, when any supplement to or amendment of the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, when any document filed under the Exchange Act was or is filed and at the Closing Date and the Additional Closing Date, if any (as hereinafter respectively defined), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not and will not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus or any related Preliminary Prospectus in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When any related Preliminary Prospectus was first filed with the Commission (whether filed as part of the registration statement for the registration of the Shares or any amendment or supplement thereto or pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act) and when any amendment thereof or supplement thereto was first filed with the Commission, such Preliminary Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No representation and warranty is made in this subsection (b), however, with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein. The parties acknowledge and agree that such information provided by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists solely of the material included in the last paragraph on the cover page of the Prospectus and in paragraphs 3, 12, 13, 14 and 18 (third and fourth sentences only) under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.

In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting in the case of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses suffered by the Company and any Selling Shareholder, any contribution received by the Company and any Selling Shareholder from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company or any Selling Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company) as incurred to which the Company, any Selling Shareholder and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the Offering or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of each of the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or a Selling Shareholder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The
Contribution
 
Company, the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each director of each Underwriter and each officer of each Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and any Selling Shareholder, as applicable, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the failure to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 9 or otherwise. The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares to be purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
10. .
Underwriter Default
 
(a) If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall default in its or their obligation to purchase Firm Shares or Additional Shares hereunder, and if the Firm Shares or Additional Shares with respect to which such default relates (the "Default Shares") do not (after giving effect to arrangements, if any, made by the Representatives pursuant to subsection (b) below) exceed in the aggregate 10% of the number of Firm Shares or Additional Shares, each non-defaulting Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company and the Selling Shareholders that number of Default Shares that bears the same proportion of the total number of Default Shares then being purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of the non-defaulting Underwriters, subject, however,
 
to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.
 
(b) In the event that the aggregate number of Default Shares exceeds 10% of the number of Firm Shares or Additional Shares, as the case may be, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or for another party or parties (including any non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters who so agree) to purchase the Default Shares on the terms contained herein. In the event that within five calendar days after such a default the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of the Default Shares as provided in this Section 10, this Agreement or, in the case of a default with respect to the Additional Shares, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company and the Selling Shareholders to sell the Additional Shares shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of the Company or the Selling Shareholders with respect thereto (except in each case as provided in Section 13 below) or the Underwriters, but nothing in this Agreement shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters of its or their liability, if any, to the other Underwriters and the Company for damages occasioned by its or their default hereunder.
 
(c) In the event that any Default Shares are to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters, or are to be purchased by another party or parties as aforesaid, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or Additional Closing Date, as the case may be for a period, not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of Underwriters' Counsel, may thereby be made necessary or advisable. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any party substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if it had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Firm Shares and Additional Shares.
 
11.
Selling Shareholder Default.
 
(a) If any Selling Shareholder or Selling Shareholders shall default in its or their obligation to sell and deliver any Firm Shares hereunder, then the Representatives may, by notice to the Company, terminate this Agreement solely with respect to the Selling Shareholders without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party except as provided in Section 13 below; , that this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as between the Company and the Underwriters. No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any Selling Shareholder so defaulting from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
provided
 
(b) In the event that such default occurs, then the Underwriters may, at the option of the Representatives, or the Company shall have the right, in each case by notice to the other, to postpone the Closing Date or Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of Underwriters' Counsel, may
 
thereby be made necessary or advisable; and in no event shall the Company be obligated to increase the number of Shares it is required to sell hereunder.
 
12. . All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary or of the Selling Shareholders submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 6, the indemnity agreements contained in Section 8 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 9, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof or by or on behalf of the Company or any Selling Shareholder, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares to and by the Underwriters.
Survival of Representations and Agreements
 
13. .
Effective Date of Agreement; Termination
 
(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon its execution by the parties hereto.
 
(b) The Representatives shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date or to terminate the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Additional Shares at any time prior to the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, if (i) any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted, or in the opinion of the Representatives will in the immediate future materially disrupt, the market for the Company's securities or securities in general; or (ii) if trading on The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or The NASDAQ National Market (the "NASDAQ") shall have been suspended or been made subject to material limitations, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, on the NYSE or the NASDAQ or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction; or (iii) if a banking moratorium has been declared by any state or federal authority or if any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services shall have occurred; or (iv) any downgrading shall have occurred in the Company's corporate credit rating or the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or if any such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; or (v) (A) if there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or there is a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (B) if there shall have been any other calamity or crisis or any change in political, financial or economic conditions if the effect of any such event in (A) or (B), in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Firm Shares or the Additional Shares, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.
 
(c) Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section 13 shall be in writing.
 
(d) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof (other than pursuant to Section 10(b) hereof), or if the sale of the Shares provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth herein is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will, subject to demand by the Representatives, reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel), incurred by the Underwriters in connection herewith.
 
(e) Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 13 and of Sections 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14 through 19, inclusive, shall be in full force and effect at all times after the execution hereof and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 10, 11 or 13 hereof.

Representations and Warranties of the Company
 
(a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-119723), and amendments thereto, and related preliminary prospectuses, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the registration of certain securities (the "Shelf Securities") of the Company to be sold from time to time by the Company. Such registration statement, as so amended (including post-effective amendments, if any), has been declared effective by the Commission and copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Underwriters. The registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement." No other document with respect to the Registration Statement has heretofore been filed with the Commission other than the prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (as defined) with respect to the Company's offering of shares of its Common Stock (as defined) as described in the Prospectus. All of the Notes have been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement. Based on communications from the Commission, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Company, if required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Exchange Act (defined below), the "Rules and Regulations"), proposes to file a prospectus supplement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act ("Rule 424(b)"). The prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Notes, in the form in which it is to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations (the "Prospectus Supplement"), along with the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement became effective (the "Base Prospectus"), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the Offering which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations), the term "Prospectus" shall also refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use. Any preliminary prospectus supplement or prospectus supplement subject to completion included in the Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act specifically relating to the Notes together with the Base Prospectus is hereafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include (i) the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, which is incorporated therein by reference and (ii) any such document so filed. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the
 
Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
 
(b) At the time of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, when any supplement to or amendment of the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, when any document filed under the Exchange Act was or is filed and at the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Rules and Regulations and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not and will not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus or any related Preliminary Prospectus in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When any related Preliminary Prospectus was first filed with the Commission (whether filed as part of the registration statement for the registration of the Notes or any amendment or supplement thereto or pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act) and when any amendment thereof or supplement thereto was first filed with the Commission, such Preliminary Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No representation and warranty is made in this subsection (b), however, with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein. The parties acknowledge and agree that such information provided by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists solely of the material included in the last paragraph on the cover page of the Prospectus and in paragraphs 3, 6, 7, 8 and 11 (third and fourth sentences only) under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
 
(c) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP whose reports appear or are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, who have certified the financial statements and supporting schedules and information of the Company and its subsidiaries that are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and KPMG Accountants N.V. whose reports appear or are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, who have certified certain other financial statements and supporting schedules and information of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel N.V.

Since the date of the latest balance sheet presented, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred or undertaken any liabilities or obligations, which are material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for liabilities, obligations and transactions which are disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
 
(e) The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company (i) was, as of September 30, 2004, as set forth in the Prospectus in the column headed "Actual" under the caption "Capitalization" and (ii) after giving effect to the Offering, the offering of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock") as described in the Prospectus and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be as set forth in the column headed "As Further Adjusted for Notes Offering" under the caption "Capitalization", except for any immaterial changes resulting from the issuance of the Common Stock pursuant to employee benefit plans, stock option plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are fully paid and non-assessable and have been duly and validly authorized and issued, in compliance with all applicable state and federal securities laws and not in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar right that does or will entitle any person, upon the issuance or sale of any security, to acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary any Common Stock or other equity security of the Company or any Subsidiary or any security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or any other such security (any "Relevant Security"), except for such rights as may have been fully satisfied or waived prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has outstanding warrants, options to purchase, or any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any contracts or commitments to issue or sell, any Relevant Security.
 
(f) The subsidiaries listed on Exhibit A hereto are the only "subsidiaries" (the "Subsidiaries") of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Except for the Subsidiaries and as otherwise listed on Exhibit B hereto or as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the Company holds no ownership or other interest, nominal or beneficial, direct or indirect, in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity.
 
(g) The Company has no "significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, other than Albemarle International Corporation. The Subsidiaries listed on Exhibit C hereto (the "Material Subsidiaries") are all the Subsidiaries that
 
are material to the business and operations of the Company. All of the issued shares of capital stock of or other ownership interests in each of the Material Subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and, to the extent applicable in the jurisdiction of organization, are non-assessable and (except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any lien, charge, mortgage, pledge, security interest, claim, equity, trust or other encumbrance, preferential arrangement, defect or restriction of any kind whatsoever (any "Lien"). Each of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries has been duly organized and validly exists as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company and is in good standing (to the extent applicable in the jurisdiction of organization) under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company in each jurisdiction (to the extent applicable in the relevant jurisdiction), in which the character or location of its properties (owned, leased or licensed) or the nature or conduct of its business makes such qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (individually and in the aggregate) could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(h) Each of Fbrica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A., Nippon Ketjen Co., Ltd., Eurecat S.A., Eurecat U.S. Incorporated and Jordan Bromine Company Ltd.

(i) Each of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures has all requisite power and authority, and all necessary consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations, qualifications, licenses, filings and permits of, with and from all judicial, regulatory and other legal or governmental agencies and bodies and all third parties, foreign and domestic (collectively, the "Consents"), to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as it is now being conducted and as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and each such Consent is valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be valid and in full force and effect would not (individually or in the aggregate) have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company, any Subsidiary, or any Joint Venture has received notice of any investigation or proceedings which could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of, or imposition of a restriction on, any such Consent which (individually or in the aggregate) could have a Material Adverse Effect. No Consent contains a materially burdensome restriction not adequately disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

8. .
Indemnification
 
(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each of the directors of each Underwriter, each of the officers of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to reasonably incurred attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof)
 
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The parties acknowledge and agree that such information provided by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives consists solely of the material referred to in the last sentence of Section 1(b) hereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
provided, however,
 
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the directors of the Company, each of the officers of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to reasonably incurred attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Notes to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. The parties acknowledge and agree that such information provided by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives consists solely of the material referred to in the last sentence of Section 1(b) hereof. This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
provided
however
 
(c) After receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection,
 
notify promptly, but in any event within 20 business days, each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this Section 8, except in the circumstance where the indemnifying party is not already a party with respect to such claim or action and the failure to give timely notice results in the forfeiture of substantive defenses by the indemnifying party). In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate, at its own expense in the defense of such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the written consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the indemnifying party does not diligently defend the action after assumption of the defense, or (iv) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded based on advice of counsel that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying party or parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such reasonably incurred fees and expenses of counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought by an indemnified party under this Section 8 or Section 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless (x) such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party, and (y) the indemnifying party confirms in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such settlement, compromise or judgment.
provided however
 
9. . In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting in the case of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses suffered by the Company, any contribution received by the Company from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who
Contribution
 
control the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company) as incurred to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the Offering or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of each of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the discounts and commissions applicable to the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each director of each Underwriter and each officer of each Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made
 
against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the failure to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 9 or otherwise. The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the respective number of Notes to be purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
10. .
Underwriter Default
 
(a) If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall default in its or their obligation to purchase Notes hereunder, and if the Notes with respect to which such default relates (the "Default Notes") do not (after giving effect to arrangements, if any, made by the Representatives pursuant to subsection (b) below) exceed in the aggregate 10% of the number of Notes, each non-defaulting Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company that number of Default Notes that bears the same proportion of the total number of Default Notes then being purchased as the number of Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Notes set forth opposite the names of the non-defaulting Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate fractional Notes in principal amounts of less than $2,000 as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.
 
(b) In the event that the aggregate number of Default Notes exceeds 10% of the number of Notes, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or for another party or parties (including any non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters who so agree) to purchase the Default Notes on the terms contained herein. In the event that within five calendar days after such a default the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of the Default Notes as provided in this Section 10, this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of the Company with respect thereto (except as provided in Section 12 below) or the Underwriters, but nothing in this Agreement shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters of its or their liability, if any, to the other Underwriters and the Company for damages occasioned by its or their default hereunder.
 
(c) In the event that any Default Notes are to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters, or are to be purchased by another party or parties as aforesaid, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of Underwriters' Counsel, may thereby be made necessary or advisable. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any party substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if it had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
 
11. . All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriters and the Company contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 6, the indemnity agreements contained in
Survival of Representations and Agreements
 
Section 8 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 9, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof or by or on behalf of the Company, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes to and by the Underwriters.
 
12. .
Effective Date of Agreement; Termination
 
(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon its execution by the parties hereto.
 
(b) The Representatives shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date, as the case may be, if (i) any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted, or in the opinion of the Representatives will in the immediate future materially disrupt, the market for the Company's securities or securities in general; or (ii) if trading on The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or The NASDAQ National Market (the "NASDAQ") shall have been suspended or been made subject to material limitations, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, on the NYSE or the NASDAQ or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction; or (iii) if a banking moratorium has been declared by any state or federal authority or if any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services shall have occurred; or (iv) any downgrading shall have occurred in the Company's corporate credit rating or the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or if any such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; or (v) (A) if there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or there is a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (B) if there shall have been any other calamity or crisis or any change in political, financial or economic conditions if the effect of any such event in (A) or (B), in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Notes, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.
 
(c) Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section 12 shall be in writing.
 
(d) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof (other than pursuant to Section 10(b) hereof), or if the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth herein is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will, subject to demand by the Representatives, reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel), incurred by the Underwriters in connection herewith.
 
(e) Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 12 and of Sections 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 13 through 18, inclusive, shall be in full force and effect at all times after the execution hereof and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 10 or 12 hereof.

All things necessary to make this Indenture a valid agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, have been done.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not received by the addressee.
 
If the Company mails a notice or communication to the Holders of Securities of a particular series, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each Security Registrar, co-registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, with respect to such series.
 
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give notice to Holders of Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the acceptance of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders of Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities.
 
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the TIA which is required under the TIA to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the required provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.
 
 
The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
 
 
All covenants and agreements of the Company in this Indenture and the Securities shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
 
 
In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
 
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, any Paying Agent and any Security Registrar and their successors hereunder and the Holders of Securities, any benefits or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
 
 
This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
 
 
A "Legal Holiday" is any day other than a Business Day. If any specified date (including an Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security, or a date for giving notice) is a Legal Holiday at any Place of Payment or place for giving notice, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities other than a provision in the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal or premium, if any, need not be made at such Place of Payment, or such other action need not be taken, on such date, but the payment or action shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption
 
Date, or at the Stated Maturity or such other date and to the extent applicable, no Original Issue Discount or interest, if any, shall accrue for the intervening period.
 
 
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Securities by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability to the extent permitted by applicable law. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Securities.
 
 
 
 
The Securities of each series shall be in substantially such form (including global form) as set forth in this Article or in such other form as shall be established by delivery to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture or any indenture supplemental hereto, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with any law, with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the Officers executing such Securities as evidenced by their execution of the Securities. The Officers' Certificate so establishing the form of Security, if any, of any series shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 3.03 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities.
 
The definitive Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the Officers executing such Securities as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

(22) any addition to or change in the covenants set forth in Article Ten which applies to Securities of the series;
 
(23) the location where the Security Register will be maintained and the location of the office maintained in accordance with Section 10.02; and
 
(24) any other terms, covenants or features of the series (which terms, covenants and features shall not be inconsistent with the provisions
 
of this Indenture or the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act, except as permitted by Section 9.01(5)).
 
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and the rate or rates of interest, if any, and Stated Maturity, the date from which interest, if any, shall accrue and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolutions and set forth in an Officers' Certificate pursuant to this Section 3.01 or in any indenture supplemental hereto; provided, however, that a different CUSIP number shall be obtained for Securities of any one series that are not identical (except as to denomination). All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01.
 
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, such Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture may provide general terms for Securities of such series and provide either that the specific terms of particular Securities of such series shall be specified in a Company Order or that such terms shall be determined by the Company, or one or more of the Company's agents designated in an Officers' Certificate, in accordance with other procedures specified in a Company Order as contemplated by the third paragraph of Section 3.03.
 
 
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture contemplated by Section 3.01, the Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
 
 
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, one of its Vice Presidents, its Chief Financial Officer or its Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer. The signature of any such officer on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
 
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities; and the Trustee in accordance with such Company Order shall authenticate and
 
deliver such Securities; provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, (1) such Company Order may be delivered by the Company to the Trustee prior to the delivery to the Trustee of such Securities for authentication and delivery, (2) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the aggregate principal amount established for such series, pursuant to a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order and (3) the rate or rates of interest, if any, the Stated Maturity or Maturities, the original issue date or dates, the redemption provisions, if any, and any other terms of Securities of such series shall be determined by a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures.
 
If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Officers' Certificates as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
 
(1) that the form and terms of such Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(2) that such Securities when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any condition specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
 
provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series and that the Opinion of Counsel above may state:
 
(x) that the forms of such Securities have been, and the terms of such Securities (when established in accordance with such procedures as may be specified from time to time in a Company Order all as contemplated by and in accordance with a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 3.01, as the case may be) will have been, duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(y) that such Securities when (i) executed by the Company, (ii) completed, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture, and (iii) issued and delivered by the Company and paid for in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations
 
of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to customary exceptions.
 
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 3.01 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series unless and until it has received written notification that such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Company's instructions to authenticate and deliver such Securities do not violate any rules, regulations or orders of any governmental agency or commission having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are subject to a Periodic Offering, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution and Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first Security of such series to be issued.
 
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the form set forth in Section 2.05.
 
Each Depositary designated for a Global Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.09 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.03 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary
 
Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Any such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first definitive Security of such series) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
Any temporary Global Security and any permanent Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to DTC or another Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01.
 
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at an office in New York City designated by the Trustee, a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 10.02 for such purpose in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and tenor.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered
 
for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06 or 11.07 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company may but shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 11.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
 
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Sections 3.03 and 3.04, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to
 
a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (a) such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling, unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and the Company has not appointed a successor within 90 days after such notification, (b) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable, subject to such Depositary's procedures, (c) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security or (d) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 3.01.
 
(4) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
 
(5) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 3.04, 3.06, 9.06, or 11.07 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
 
 
If (a) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide or protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in exchange for any mutilated Security or in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment.
 
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of that series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01) for the Securities of such series equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit
 
prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of that series at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any particular series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.05, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 and subject to Section 3.05 and Section 3.07) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held directly or indirectly on its behalf by a Depositary (or its nominee) shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security or any Security represented thereby, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the
 
Trustee as the owner of such Global Security or any Security represented thereby for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by a Depositary or impair, as between a Depositary and such holders of beneficial interests in the Securities, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary (or its nominees) as Holder of any Security.
 
 
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any sinking fund payment, shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever (including Securities received by the Company in exchange or payment for other Securities of the Company) and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered to the Trustee shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. The Company may not reissue, or issue new Securities to replace, Securities it has paid for or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures and the Trustee shall deliver a certificate of such disposition to the Company upon receipt of a request therefor.
 
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of any series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers or both numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use such "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers or both numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers.
 
 
 
 
 
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:
 
(1) either
 
(a) all Securities of that series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities of that series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(b) all such Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
 
(i) have become due and payable, or
 
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
 
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
 
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee, as trust funds in trust for the purpose, Cash, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities of that series which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
 
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company relating to that series of Securities;
 
(3) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound;
 
(4) the Company has deposited irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of such Securities of that series at Maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be; and
 
(5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities have been complied with.
 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Sections 6.07 and 13.05, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if Cash, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last paragraph of Section 10.03 shall survive.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with, or received by, the Trustee.
 
 
 
 
"Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events and such other events as may be established with respect to the Securities of such series as contemplated by Section 3.01 (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
 
(1) Default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such Default for a period of 30 days;
 
(2) Default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity;
 
(3) Default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and continuance of such Default for a period of 30 days;
 
(4) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Article Eight;
 
(5) Default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture or the Securities (other than a covenant or warranty whose performance or breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such Default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such Default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder;
 
(6) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary defaults under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of this Indenture, which default:
 
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
 
(b) results in the cross-acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision");
 
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $40 million or more;
 
(7) the Company or a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
 
(a) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;
 
(b) consents to the entry of a judgment, decree or order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding;
 
(c) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property;
 
(d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
 
(e) consents to or acquiesces in the institution of a bankruptcy or an insolvency proceeding against it;
 
(f) takes any corporate action to authorize or effect any of the foregoing; or
 
(g) takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency;
 
(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
 
(a) is for relief in an involuntary case against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law;
 
(b) appoints a Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary; or
 
(c) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary; and
 
(d) in each case the order, decree or relief remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or
 
(9) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
 
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(7) or 5.01(8) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of (or, if any of the Securities of that series are
 
Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) all the Securities of that series to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal (or portion thereof) together with accrued interest and all other amounts owing hereunder, shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(7) or 5.01(8) occurs, the principal amount (or portion thereof) and accrued interest of all the Securities of each series then outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Outstanding Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
 
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) a sum sufficient to pay:
 
(a) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
 
(b) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
 
(c) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
 
(d) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
 
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
 
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
The Trustee shall have no obligations or liability for failure to act in connection with any Event of Default not actually known to a Responsible Officer.
 
 
 
The Company covenants that if:
 
(1) Default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such Default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(2) Default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
 
then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such right, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relating to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07.
 
No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such
 
proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
 
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
 
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article with respect to the Securities of a series shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
 
First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07;
 
Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money had been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, and any premium and interest, respectively; and
 
Third: The balance, if any, to the Company.
 
 
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
 
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
 
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
 
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders of Securities of that series.
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of any Holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of and (subject to Section 3.07) interest and premium, if any, on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities or any Redemption Date, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected adversely without the consent of each such Holder.
 
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
 
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted
 
by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
 
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that:
 
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and
 
(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series that would be affected by such a default (voting as one class) may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, waive any past Default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a Default:
 
(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or
 
(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
 
Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
 
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 5.14 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 5.07 or 5.08 or a suit by Holders of more than l0% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series.
 
 
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted.
 
 
 
 
The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series,
 
(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
 
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture, but not to verify the contents thereof.
 
(b) In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
 
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that
 
(1) this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to limit the effect of paragraph (a) of this Section;
 
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities pursuant to Section 5.12 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series; and
 
(4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee (when serving in such capacity or in the capacity of Paying Agent, Security Registrar, or any other capacity under this Indenture) shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
 
 
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, notice of such Default or Event of Default hereunder known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the Board of Directors, the executive committee or a trust
 
committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.01:
 
(1) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
 
(2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order or as otherwise expressly provided herein, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;
 
(3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel;
 
(4) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
 
(5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
 
(6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;
 
(7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
 
(8) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture;
 
(9) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each officer, director and employee of the Trustee and any agent, custodian and other Person employed by the Trustee to act hereunder;
 
(10) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded;
 
(11) the permissive right of the Trustee to take actions permitted by this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty or obligation; and
 
(12) the Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety with respect to the performance of its duties or the exercise of its powers under this Indenture.
 
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
 
 
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.08 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not such Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.
 
 
Money held by the Trustee for any series of Securities in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.
 
 
The Company agrees:
 
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder as shall be agreed upon in writing by the Trustee and the Company (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel); and
 
(3) to indemnify, defend and hold the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee (and their officers, directors, employees and agents) harmless for and against, any and all loss, liability, damages, claim or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee), arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
 
The Company need not reimburse any expense, disbursement or advance, or indemnify, defend or hold the Trustee or predecessor Trustee (or their officers, directors, employees or agents) harmless for and against any loss, liability, damages, claims or expenses incurred by the Trustee, to the extent such expense, disbursement, advance, loss, liability, damages, claims or expenses was proven to have been caused by the Trustee's negligence or bad faith.
 
The foregoing provisions shall be applicable to the Trustee when serving in its capacity as Trustee and when serving as Paying Agent, Security Registrar or in any other capacity under this Indenture.
 
The Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities as to all property and funds held by it hereunder for any amount owing it or any predecessor Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.07, except with respect to funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities.
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(7) or 5.01(8), such expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
This section shall survive the discharge of the Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
 
 
If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series, nor shall it be subject to disqualification if the Company has sustained the burden of proving, upon application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that the conflicting interest in question is not so likely to involve a material conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee from acting hereunder.
 
 
There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person files reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so filed. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
 
 
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11.
 
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
If at any time:
 
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.08, or
 
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
 
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
 
then, in any such case, (a) the Company by a Company Order may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (b) subject to Section 5.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Company Order, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within
 
one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have not been appointed by the Company pursuant to Section 6.10, then a successor Trustee may be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 1.07. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all amounts due and owing to the retiring Trustee, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (b) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (c) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture
 
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
 
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
 
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
 
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authentication Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee or Authentication Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authentication Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
 
 
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent provided therein.
 
 
At any time when any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding, the Trustee, with the concurrence of the Company, may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue, and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.06, and Securities
 
so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal, state or District of Columbia authority. If such Authenticating Agent files reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so filed. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.07 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
 
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
 
If the Trustee is not acting as Security Registrar for the Securities of any series and to the extent otherwise required by the Trust Indenture Act, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee in writing:
 
(1) at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date for each series of Securities (or, if there is no Interest Payment Date relating to a series of Securities, semi-annually, not later than January 15 and July 15 in each year), a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities of each series as of such dates, and
 
(2) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished.
 
The Company shall otherwise comply with Section 312(a) of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
 
The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 7.01 and the names and addresses of Holders received by the Trustee in its
 
capacity as Security Registrar, if so acting. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 7.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
 
The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
 
Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to the names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.
 
 
The Trustee shall transmit to Holders within 60 days of May 15 of each year such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture as may be required and in the manner specified in the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the 12-month period ending on May 14 of such year.
 
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which any Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on any stock exchange.
 
 
The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, and transmit to Holders, such information, documents and other reports, and such summaries thereof, as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act; provided that any such information, documents or reports required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act shall be filed with the Trustee within 15 days after the same is so required to be filed with the Commission; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of said Sections, then it will file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the information, documents and other reports, and such summaries thereof, which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act in respect of which a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations.
 
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, unless:
 
(1) either (a) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (b) the Person (if other than the Company) (the "Successor Corporation") formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company (i) shall be a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture;
 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Successor Corporation as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Corporation or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default exists;
 
(3) if, as a result of any such consolidation or merger or such conveyance, transfer or lease, properties or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary would become subject to a Lien which would not be permitted by this Indenture, the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, will comply with Section 10.07; and
 
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this Indenture and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied.
 
For purposes of this Section 8.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
 
Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
 
 
The successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the successor Person to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the Company herein; and thereafter except in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its properties and assets, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.
 
 
 
 
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, when requested by or pursuant to a Company Request, at any time and from time to time, may amend this Indenture or enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
 
(1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such successor of the obligations of the Company herein and in the Securities; or
 
(2) to add to the covenants of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; or
 
(3) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such additional Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such additional Events of Default are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series); or
 
(4) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form; or
 
(5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities, provided that any such addition, change or elimination (a) shall neither (i) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (ii) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding; or
 
(6) to secure the Securities pursuant to the requirements of Section 10.07 or otherwise; or
 
(7) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01; or
 
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11; or
 
(9) to comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or
 
(10) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, provided that such action pursuant to this Clause (10) shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect.
 
After an amendment or supplement under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Securityholders of the series affected thereby a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders of such series, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment or supplement under this Section.
 
 
With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Securities) of all series affected by such supplemental indenture (each series voting together as one class), by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, when requested by a Company Request, may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto or amend this Indenture for the purpose of adding any
 
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture and, subject to Section 5.13, any past default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture with respect to a particular series of Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Securities) of such series (such series voting as a single class). However, no such supplemental indenture, amendment or waiver shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby,
 
(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.02, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption or repayment, on or after the Redemption Date or any repayment date); or
 
(2) reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture or amendment, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain Defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture; or
 
(3) impair any right (if provided for in Section 3.01) of a Holder to exchange or convert Securities for or into other securities; or
 
(4) add any provisions providing for the subordination of the Securities; or
 
(5) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 5.13 or Section 9.01, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 9.01, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6.11 and 9.01(8).
 
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular
 
series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
 
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, waiver or supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under this Indenture by any Holder of a particular series of Securities given in connection with a tender or exchange of such Holder's Securities will not be rendered invalid by such tender or exchange.
 
After an amendment or supplement under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Securityholders of the series affected thereby a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders of such series, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment or supplement under this Section.
 
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and Officer's Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, privileges, protections, benefits or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
 
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
 
 
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
 
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture
 
may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
 
A consent to an amendment, supplement or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Security. Any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives a written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective or otherwise in accordance with any related solicitation documents. After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (5) of Section 9.02, in which case the amendment, supplement, waiver or other action shall bind each Securityholder who has consented to it and every subsequent Securityholder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Securities. An amendment, supplement or waiver shall become effective upon receipt by the Trustee of the requisite number of written consents under Section 9.02.
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described in Section 9.02 above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall become valid or effective more than 120 days after such record date.
 
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. In the absence of contrary provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of any series may, at the option of the Company, be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears on the Security Register. An installment of principal of or interest on the Securities shall be considered paid on the date it is due if the Trustee or a Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on that date immediately available funds designated for and sufficient to pay such installment. To the extent lawful, and if so provided for with respect to a particular series of Securities, the Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified therefor in the Securities,
 
and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the applicable series of Securities.
 
 
As long as any of the Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for such series an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. An office in New York City designated by the Trustee shall be such office or agency of the Company, unless the Company shall designate and maintain some additional office or agency for one or more of such purposes. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 1.06, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such notices and demands.
 
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of its action or failure so to act.
 
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (a)
 
comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (b) during the continuance of any Default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
 
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company upon receipt of a Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, if any such money represents the principal of, premium, if any, or interest payable with respect to Securities that are in bearer form or that are registered to bearer, the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in each Place of Payment, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
 
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, one of the signatures of which shall be that of the Company's principal executive, financial or accounting officer, stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of the Company they would normally have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and whether or not, to the best knowledge of the signers thereof, the Company is in Default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) or there is an Event of Default and, if the Company shall be in Default or there is an Event of Default, specifying all such Defaults and Events of Default and the nature and status thereof.
 
 
Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence in accordance with its organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time), rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not, and will not be, disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
 
 
The Company will or will cause a Restricted Subsidiary to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves, if necessary (in the good faith judgment of management of the Company), are being maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America or if the Company shall determine that the failure to pay would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
 
 
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any Indebtedness secured by any Lien upon any Principal Property or shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiaries, without making, or causing such Restricted Subsidiary to contemporaneously make, effective provision whereby the Securities then Outstanding and having the benefit of this Section shall be secured by the Lien equally and ratably with such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness shall be so secured, except that the foregoing shall not prevent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from creating, assuming or suffering to exist any Lien existing at the date of this Indenture or Liens of the following character:
 
(1) any Lien existing on any Principal Property owned or leased by a corporation at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
 
(2) any Lien existing on any Principal Property at the time of the acquisition thereof by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which Lien was not incurred in anticipation of such acquisition and was outstanding prior to such acquisition;
 
(3) any Lien to secure any Indebtedness incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 12 months after the acquisition of any Principal Property for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof and any Lien to the extent that it secures Indebtedness which is in excess of such purchase price and for the payment of which recourse may be had only against such Principal Property;
 
(4) any Lien to secure any Indebtedness incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 12 months after the completion of the construction and commencement of commercial operation, alteration, repair or improvement of any Principal Property for the purpose of financing all or any part of the cost thereof and any Lien to the extent that it secures Indebtedness which is in excess of such cost and for the payment of which recourse may be had only against such Principal Property;
 
(5) any Lien in favor of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
 
(6) any Lien in favor of the United States of America or any state thereof or any other country, or any agency, instrumentality or political subdivision or any of the foregoing, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments or performance pursuant to the provisions of any contract or statute, or to secure any Indebtedness incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of constructing or improving the property subject to such Lien;
 
(7) Liens imposed by law, such as mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, materialmen's, carriers', warehousemen's, vendors' or other similar Liens arising in the ordinary course of business, or governmental (federal, state or municipal) Liens arising out of contracts for the sale of products or services by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or deposits or pledges to obtain the release of any of the foregoing;
 
(8) pledges or deposits under workmen's compensation laws or similar legislation and Liens of judgments thereunder which are not currently dischargeable, or good faith deposits in connection with bids, tenders, contracts (other than for the payment of money) or leases to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party, or deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or deposits in connection with obtaining or maintaining self-insurance or to obtain the benefits of any law, regulation or arrangement pertaining to unemployment insurance, old age pensions, social security or similar matters, or deposits of cash or obligations of the United States of America to secure surety, appeal or customs bonds to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party, or deposits in litigation or other proceedings such as, but not limited to, interpleader proceedings;
 
(9) Liens created by or resulting from any litigation or other proceeding which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, including Liens arising out of judgments or awards against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with respect to which the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in good faith prosecuting an appeal or proceedings for review; or Liens incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for the purpose of obtaining a stay or discharge in the course of any litigation or other proceeding to which the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is a party;
 
(10) Liens for taxes or assessments or governmental charges or levies not yet due or delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;
 
(11) Liens consisting of easements, rights-of-way, zoning restrictions, restrictions on the use of real property, and defects and irregularities in the title thereto, landlords' liens and other similar liens and encumbrances none of which interfere materially with the use of the property covered thereby in the ordinary course of the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary and which do not, in the opinion of the Company, materially detract from the value of such properties;
 
(12) any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in clauses (1) through (11) above, so long as the principal amount of the Indebtedness secured thereby does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness so secured at the time of the extension, renewal or replacement (except that, where an additional principal amount of Indebtedness is incurred to provide funds for the completion of a specific project, the additional principal amount, and any related financing costs, may be secured by the Lien as well) and the Lien is limited to the same property subject to the Lien so extended, renewed or replaced (plus improvements on the property).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.07, the Company and any one or more Restricted Subsidiaries may issue, assume or guarantee Indebtedness secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions if at the time the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary does so (the "Incurrence Time") the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness plus all other Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including Indebtedness permitted to be secured under the foregoing restrictions), plus the aggregate Attributable Debt (determined as of the Incurrence Time) of Sale and Leaseback Transactions (other than Sale and Leaseback Transactions permitted by Section 10.08) entered into after the date hereof and in existence at the Incurrence Time (less the aggregate amount of proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transactions which shall have been applied in accordance with Section 10.08) does not exceed 15% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
 
 
The Company will not itself, and it will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement including any bank, insurance company or other lender or investor (not including the Company or any Affiliate) or to which any such lender or investor is a party, providing for the leasing by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary for a period, including renewals, in excess of three years of any Principal Property which has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to such lender or investor or to any Person to whom funds have been or are to be advanced by such lender or investor on the security of such Principal Property (herein referred to as a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless either:
 
(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would, at the time of entering into such arrangement, be entitled, without equally and ratably securing the Securities of each series then Outstanding, to incur, issue, assume or guarantee Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such property, pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (13), inclusive, of Section 10.07; or
 
(2) the Company, within 180 days after the sale or transfer shall have been made by the Company or by a Restricted Subsidiary, applies an amount equal to the greater of (a) the net proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property sold and leased back pursuant to such arrangement or (b) the fair market value of the Principal Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such arrangement (as determined by: the Chairman or a Vice Chairman of the Board of the Company, its President or a Vice President, and by its Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary) to the retirement of Funded Debt of the Company;
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any of them, may enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction which would otherwise be prohibited by this Section 10.08, provided, that either (1) such transaction involves the transfer of property to a governmental body, authority or corporation, such as a development authority, is entered into primarily for the purpose of obtaining economic incentives and does not involve a third-party lender or investor, or (2) at the time of such transaction, after giving effect thereto, the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the Attributable Debt in respect of all Sale and Leaseback Transactions existing at such time which could not have been entered into except for the provisions of this paragraph plus (ii) the aggregate amount of outstanding debt secured by Liens in reliance on the last paragraph of Section 10.07 does not at such time exceed 15% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company.

Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article.
 
 
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be pursuant to a Board Resolution and evidenced by a Company Order. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all of the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
 
 
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such Securities are listed, or, if such Securities are not so listed, pro rata or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements) and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. The selection, by the Trustee, of the Securities to be redeemed shall be conclusive and binding and the Trustee shall incur no liability in connection with such selection.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
 
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section 11.03, the selection of Securities, or portions thereof, that are represented by a Global Security or that are held by or on behalf of a Depositary, in the case of any partial redemption, shall also be made in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of such Depositary and neither the Trustee nor the Company shall have any liability or responsibility with respect thereto.
 
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the Holder's address appearing in the Security Register.
 
All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities being redeemed (including the CUSIP or ISIN number) and state:
 
(1) the Redemption Date,
 
(2) the Redemption Price,
 
(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed,
 
(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
 
(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any,
 
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case,
 
(7) the name and address of the Paying Agent,
 
(8) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price, and
 
(9) that no representation is made as to the accuracy or correctness of the CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
 
In addition, unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 3.01, such notice may state that (1) the redemption will be conditional upon the Trustee or the Paying Agent receiving sufficient funds to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities subject to redemption on the Redemption Date and (2) if the Trustee or the Paying Agent does not receive those funds, the redemption notice will not apply, and the Company will not be required to redeem the Securities subject to redemption.
 
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.
 
 
On or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date, other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption that are beneficially owned by the Company and have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities or portions of Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified (together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the only right of the Holders thereof will be to receive payment of the redemption price and, subject to the next sentence, unpaid interest on such Securities to the Redemption Date. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07.
 
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
 
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered; provided, however, that if a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Security so issued shall be a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered.
 
 
 
 
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
 
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of the Securities of such series.
 
 
The Company (a) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series with the same issue date, interest rate and Stated Maturity (other than any previously called for redemption), and (b) may apply as a credit Securities of a series with the same issue date, interest rate and Stated Maturity which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series with the same issue date, interest rate and Stated Maturity; provided that such Securities have not been previously so
 
credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
 
Not less than 35 days (or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee) prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date shall be selected in the manner specified in Section 11.03 and the Trustee shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.06 and 11.07.
 
 
 
 
The Company will have the right, at any time, to have Section 13.02 or Section 13.03 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be (other than Securities of a series designated pursuant to Section 3.01 as not being defeasible pursuant to Section 13.02 or 13.03), upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any request under this Article shall be evidenced by a Company Order or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities.
 
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its right to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.04 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 13.04 and as more fully set forth in such Section, (i) payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on the
 
Outstanding Securities on the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of principal of and any premium or interest and (ii) the benefit of any mandatory sinking fund payments applicable to the Securities on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Securities of such series, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 10.02 and 10.03, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder including the duty of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued on registration of transfer or exchange and the Company's obligation in connection therewith, and (d) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option to have this Section applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option to have Section 13.03 applied to such securities.
 
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its right to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (a) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 8.01(3), Sections 10.07 and 10.08, and any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.01(22), 9.01(2) or 9.01(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (b) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.01(4) (with respect to Section 8.01(3)) or 5.01(5) (with respect to Sections 10.07 and 10.08, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.01(22), 9.01(2) or 9.01(7)) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.04 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Sections 5.01(4) and 5.01(5)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
 
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 13.02 or Section 13.03 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:
 
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (a) Cash in an amount, or (b) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide (without reinvestment), not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (c) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee to pay and discharge,
 
the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities or Redemption Date, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "U.S. Government Obligation" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the timely payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the timely payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) shall also include a depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation which is specified in Clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt.
 
(2) In the event of an election to have Section 13.02 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (a) or (b) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.
 
(3) In the event of an election to have Section 13.03 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.
 
(4) Such provision would not cause any Outstanding Securities if then listed on any securities exchange, to be delisted as a result of such deposit.
 
(5) No Default or Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit) or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 5.01(7) and 5.01(8), on the later of (a) the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 91st day) or (b) the day ending on the day following the expiration of the longest preference period under any Bankruptcy Law applicable to the Company in respect of such deposit.
 
(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act).
 
(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.
 
(8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.
 
(9) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 13.04 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 13.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
 
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any Cash or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 13.04 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
 
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any Cash or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 13.02 or 13.03 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such Cash or U.S. Government Obligations held in trust pursuant to Section 13.05 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the Cash or U.S. Government Obligations so held in trust by the Trustee or the Paying Agent.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Indenture as of the day and year first above written.

Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates or the date of Maturity (or any earlier redemption or repayment date), as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the case where the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) does not fall on a Business Day, payment of interest, premium, if any, or principal otherwise payable on such date need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date), and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) to such next succeeding Business Day.
 
This Note and all the obligations of the Company hereunder are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank without preference or priority among themselves and with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company, subject to certain statutory exceptions in the event of liquidation upon insolvency.
pari passu
 
The Notes are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
 
For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph, the following defined terms shall have the meanings specified:
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors and (2) two other Primary Treasury Dealers; , that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
provided, however
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed. Such notice of redemption shall set forth the formula for, and the calculation of, the redemption price of the Notes.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Company will pay interest to a person other than the Holder of record on the Regular Record Date if the Company elects to redeem the Notes on a date that is after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In this instance, the Company will pay accrued interest on the Notes being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date to the same person to whom the Company will pay the principal of those Notes.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the indebtedness represented by the Notes or certain restrictive covenants (and related Events of Default) with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains specified Events of Default which will apply with respect to the Notes. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect prescribed in the Indenture.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee satisfactory indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

The Company has initially appointed the Trustee as Security Registrar for the Notes.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 3, 2005, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on February 3, 2005, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
 
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information about the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, including the Company's acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel on July 31, 2004, and, in doing so, improves transparency to investors and enhances period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Announces Preliminary Fourth-Quarter 2004 Unaudited Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., February 3  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 of $19.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share. Fourth-quarter 2003 net income, excluding special items, was $18.4 million, or 44 cents per diluted share. Special items for fourth-quarter 2003 totaling $1.6 million after income tax, or 4 cents per diluted share, are outlined in the reconciliation below.
 
Excluding special items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $75.7 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to $66.8 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003. Inclusive of special items, primarily related to the acquisition of Akzo Nobel's refinery catalysts business, net income for 2004 was $54.8 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, versus $71.9 million, or $1.71 per diluted share for 2003.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2004 were $451.1 million, compared with net sales of $295.1 million for the same quarter last year. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $1.51 billion as compared with $1.11 billion in the same period of 2003.
 
Average common shares used to compute fourth-quarter and year 2004 diluted earnings per share were 43,083,000 and 42,527,000, up slightly from 42,113,000 and 42,146,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2003, primarily due to the exercise of stock options.
 
Below is selected data related to our net income and related per share amounts for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. Selected data for the year ended December 31, 2004 is included following the notes to the condensed financial statements. It should be noted that net income excluding special items is a financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with
 
GAAP. It is provided here because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information that excludes the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, improves transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
 
 
Quarterly Results
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales, which now excludes the polyolefin catalysts business, were up 24.7 percent for fourth-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003. This represents the eighth-straight quarter of record sales and can be attributed primarily to continued strong performance in brominated flame retardants volume and pricing. Polymer Additives operating profit improved 27.4 percent to $18.4 million, while operating margin in this segment improved by 21 basis points year over year.
 
Catalysts segment net sales were $129.6 million, up $109.6 million for fourth-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003, due primarily to the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business from Akzo Nobel. Catalysts operating profit for fourth-quarter 2004 amounted to $13.0 million, up $9.0 million from the 2003 fourth-quarter period, due to the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business from Akzo Nobel and strong performance of the polyolefin catalysts business. However, these gains failed to offset fully increased raw materials and energy costs experienced during the quarter.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales were up 7.3 percent for fourth-quarter 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in 2003, driven by improved product mix in the Fine Chemistry Services and Intermediates product area and improved demand and pricing in bromine and derivatives. Fine Chemicals operating profit was down 12.3 percent to $12.8 million, compared to fourth-quarter 2003, due to higher raw material costs and product mix effects in agricultural actives.
 
The corporate effective income tax rate ("ETR") for fourth-quarter 2004 amounted to approximately 18%, down from 29% for the corresponding period in 2003. The fourth-quarter 2004 ETR benefited from $1.5 million related to the reversal of certain income tax reserves and the net favorable effect of $1.1 million in adjustments associated with the reconciliation of certain tax accounts.
 
Commenting on the 2004 fourth quarter results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, "Despite higher raw materials and energy costs, which hit particularly hard in the fourth quarter, we are seeing traction on price increases, along with good demand in all three segments, that should allow us to address margin improvement into 2005. Our ability to exceed our preliminary earnings estimate is a direct result of the dedication exhibited by our global team to drive for results in the face of significant headwinds. We continue to be pleased with the strong contribution from the refinery catalysts business as integration proceeds. In the early weeks of 2005, Albemarle announced concurrent public offerings of common stock and senior notes. Both offerings, which closed on January 20, were met with a high degree of interest in the market, allowing us to use the net proceeds to repay in full the $450 million bridge loan incurred in connection with the refinery catalysts acquisition. We issued 4,573,000 shares in the offering."
 
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 will be discussed on a conference call at 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 3, 2005, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at www.albemarle.com.

Rocheleau, the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to correct certain typographical errors contained in their respective Compensation Arrangements. The Compensation Arrangements for each of Messrs. Rohr and Rocheleau are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.3 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. The Amendments to the Compensation Arrangements for each of Messrs. Rohr and Rocheleau are included as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.4 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
2005 Base Salaries
 
On December 17, 2004, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") approved the following 2005 base salaries, which were effective as of January 1, 2005, for the Company's named executive officers (the "Named Executive Officers"): Mark C. Rohr, President and Chief Executive Officer ($600,000); Paul F. Rocheleau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ($350,000); John M. Steitz, Senior Vice President  Business Operations ($330,000); William M. Gottwald, Chairman of the Board ($300,000); and George A. Newbill, Senior Vice President  Manufacturing Operations ($280,000).
 
2004 Bonuses
 
On February 1, 2005, the Committee approved the following bonus payments under the Company's 2003 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") for the Named Executive Officers for 2004: Mark C. Rohr ($400,000); Paul F. Rocheleau ($180,000); John M. Steitz ($180,000); William M. Gottwald ($170,000); and George A. Newbill ($145,000).
 
2005 Incentive Plan Metrics
 
On March 2, 2005, the Committee approved the 2005 metrics for executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, each of the Named
 
Executive Officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to 2 times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain criteria established by the Committee are met for 2005. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (70%); Paul F. Rocheleau (50%); John M. Steitz (50%); William M. Gottwald (60%); and George A. Newbill (50%). The Committee determined that the criteria for 2005 are annual net income before special items, revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin, free cash flow, stewardship, corporate governance and development of people.
 
The Incentive Plan also contemplates the possibility of the payment of additional discretionary incentives to the Named Executive Officers, but only in the event that individual's performance merits consideration of such additional incentives. Any incentive payments under the Incentive Plan will be paid in the first quarter of 2006.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 31, 2005, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") approved a salary increase for Mark C. Rohr, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, from $600,000 to $775,000, effective April 1, 2005. After a review of peer group companies and consultation with the Committee's independent outside consultant, the Committee decided to increase the Chief Executive Officer's base salary to provide a competitive total compensation package. The Committee believes that this increase in base salary is consistent with the overall objectives of the Company's executive compensation program as described in the Committee's report in the Company's proxy statement, dated March 18, 2005, in that it will bring the Chief Executive Officer's salary in line with peer group companies. The Committee also believes that the Chief Executive Officer's salary is reasonable and is not excessive.

Shareholder Proposals
 
(a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.
 
(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only (A) pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any shareholder of the Company who was a shareholder of record of the Company who is entitled to vote at the meeting at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section.
 
(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
 
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
 
(c) General.
 
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of
 
such shareholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such shareholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C) of this section) and (B) to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the shareholder (or a designated representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.
 
(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this section.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 26, 2005, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the first quarter and three months ended March 31, 2005. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on April 26, 2005, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the first quarter and three months ended March 31, 2005. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
 
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information about the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, and, in doing so, improves transparency to investors and enhances period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statement and Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: April 26, 2005
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Albemarle Announces Record First-Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., April 26  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first-quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $25.2 million, or 54 cents per share, which was 53 percent higher than first-quarter 2004, due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. The Company reported record net sales of $510 million, up $188 million compared to 2004, due in large part to the July 2004 acquisition of the Akzo Nobel refinery catalysts business.
 
Including special items, net income for first-quarter 2005 was $24.3 million or 52 cents per share. Special items for the quarter totaled $0.9 million, or two cents per share, related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the refinery catalysts acquisition. In the comparable period last year, net income was $13.6 million, or 32 cents per share, including $2.9 million in special items related to a workforce reduction in conjunction with the exit from the zeolites business.
 
Earnings per share were based on 46,885,000 fully diluted average shares outstanding, up from 42,200,000 for the corresponding period in 2004, due mainly to the Company's January 2005 public offering of common stock totaling 4,573,000 shares.
 
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per share amounts for the first quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 are shown in the Additional Information section below.
 
Quarterly Segment Results
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales were $198.1 million, up $25.4 million versus 2004. This represents the ninth-straight quarter of record sales and can be attributed to continued
 
improvement in pricing across the segment. Polymer Additives operating profit, including joint ventures (segment income), improved 16.9 percent to $23.8 million as pricing gains outpaced the continued rise in raw material costs.
 
Catalysts segment net sales were $172.8 million, up $149.9 million versus first-quarter 2004, due mainly to the addition of the refinery catalyst business and strong sales of hydroprocessing catalysts. Polyolefin catalysts also posted strong volumes for the quarter due to increased demand for our products. Catalysts segment income for first-quarter 2005 amounted to $25.1 million, up $22.3 million from last year, driven by hydroprocessing catalyst shipments, good cost management and solid contribution from joint ventures.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales were $139.0 million, up $12.6 million versus last year, driven by improved pricing and demand in bromine and derivatives and improved product mix in Fine Chemistry Services. Fine Chemicals segment income was $11.6 million, up $7.8 million compared to first-quarter 2004, which included a $4.5 million charge associated with the exit from the zeolite business. In addition to higher prices and favorable product mix, the Company's Jordan bromine joint venture contributed positive earnings that helped to offset continued pressure from higher raw material costs.
 
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses increased $8.7 million versus 2004, including a $1.4 million special charge for the write-off of unamortized bridge loan fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business. The corporate effective income tax rate for first-quarter 2005 amounted to 31.4%, up from first-quarter 2004 due largely to geographical income mix.
 
Commentary
 
Commenting on first-quarter 2005 results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, "We are obviously very pleased with our results this quarter. Catalysts operating results were significantly higher than anticipated, driven by strong demand for hydroprocessing catalysts, excellent pricing momentum and cost synergies. Our Fine Chemicals turnaround plan is paying off with higher value products in our portfolio. We now have 96 new products in our pharmaceutical-related pipeline with an additional 45 non-pharmaceutical products. Polymer Additives continues its record net sales growth for yet another quarter.
 
We realized the results of exceptional pricing execution across our business segments, offsetting over $20 million of raw material and energy cost increases in Polymer Additives and Fine Chemicals. During the quarter we announced further price increases for key flame retardant products, which become effective April 1, 2005. In addition, we announced a 9 percent worldwide price increase for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts. Continued growth in demand should allow us to further support margin improvement in 2005."
 
Earnings Call
 
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005 will be discussed on a conference call at 1:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on April 26, 2005, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statement
 
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; increased government regulation of our operations or our products; and the integration of the Akzo Nobel Refinery Catalysts business or future acquisitions into our operations.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 20, 2005, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on July 20, 2005, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
 
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's performance as it presents investors with information about the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company, and, in doing so, improves transparency to investors and enhances period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Albemarle Announces Second-Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., July 20  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second-quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $29 million, or 60 cents per share, up 50 percent from second-quarter 2004, due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. The Company reported net sales of $502.8 million, an increase of $176 million compared to 2004, due in large part to the refinery catalysts business acquisition and significant pricing improvement across each segment.
 
Net income, including special items, for second-quarter 2005 was $32.1 million, or 67 cents per share, which was up 54 percent from 2004. Second quarter 2005 special items are related to a change in the Company's post-retirement health care benefits plans, resulting in an after-tax gain of $3.6 million, or seven cents per share, partially offset by an after-tax charge of $0.5 million, or one cent per share, as provision for future potential settlement of legal claims. In the comparable period last year, net income was $20.8 million, or 49 cents per share, which included after-tax realized foreign exchange hedging gains of $1.8 million, associated with the July 2004 acquisition of the Akzo Nobel refinery catalysts business, offset in part, by an after-tax $0.4 million charge related to the Pasadena plant facility.
 
Six-months' 2005 net income, excluding special items, was $54.2 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $35.8 million, or 85 cents per share, in 2004. Special items in first-half 2005 related to the $3.6 million after-tax retiree benefits plan change and $0.5 million legal provision mentioned above, in addition to a $0.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the refinery catalysts business acquisition. Six-months 2004 results included after-tax charges of $3.2 million in special items related to the closure of the zeolite business, offset by $1.8 million after taxes of realized foreign exchange hedging gains associated with the refinery catalysts business acquisition.
 
Average common shares used to compute second-quarter and six-months 2005 earnings per share were 47,971,000 and 47,428,000, up from 42,282,000 and 42,241,000 respectively for the corresponding periods in 2004, due mainly to the Company's January 2005 public offering of 4,573,000 shares of common stock.
 
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per share amounts for the second-quarters and six-months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items.
 
Quarterly Segment Results
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales were $204.4 million, up $24.4 million versus 2004. Polymer Additives operating profit, including joint ventures (segment income), improved 30 percent to $29.4 million, driven by strong performance in brominated flame retardants and overall gains in pricing. These results represent record sales and profit performance for the segment.
 
Catalysts segment net sales were $147.3 million, up $122.9 million versus second-quarter 2004, due mainly to the addition of the refinery catalysts business and strong sales of hydroprocessing catalysts. Catalysts segment income for second-quarter 2005 amounted to $24.3 million, up $21.7 million from last year, driven by hydroprocessing catalyst shipments and solid contribution from joint ventures.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales were $151.0 million, up $28.7 million versus last year, driven by improved pricing and demand in bromine and derivatives and improved product mix in Fine Chemistry Services. Fine Chemicals segment income was $14.9 million, up $3.4 million compared to second-quarter 2004. In addition to higher bromine and derivative prices and contribution from the new product pipeline, the Company's Jordan bromine joint venture continued to contribute positive earnings.
 
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses increased $8.8 million versus 2004 as a result of additional debt incurred to finance the refinery catalysts business acquisition. The corporate effective income tax rate for second-quarter 2005 amounted to 30.3 percent, up from second-quarter 2004 due largely to geographical income mix.
 
Commentary
 
Commenting on second-quarter 2005 results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, "We are pleased with our strong results this quarter. The Catalysts Segment continues to perform above our expectations, driven by strong demand for hydroprocessing catalysts, excellent pricing momentum and cost synergies. We believe that our Fine Chemicals turnaround plan is on-track and we are realizing the benefits of our strong bromine chemicals position. We now have approximately 100 new products in our pharmaceutical-related pipeline with an additional 50 non-pharmaceutical products. We are especially pleased with the performance of a number of our newly introduced flame retardants and additives. Polymer Additives profitability has improved as our pricing initiatives more than offset the underlying raw material and energy inflation, resulting in record quarter performance."
 
"Across the Company we continue to contain costs and drive pricing to ensure we are delivering the margins necessary to support further investment in our businesses. We have recently announced significant expansion plans in hydroprocessing catalysts and flame retardants and announced plans to increase our manufacturing and technical presence in China to support the growth of our customers. Strong performance from joint ventures continues to be an important contribution to increased income in each segment."
 
Earnings Call
 
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on July 20, 2005, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statement

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; increased government regulation of our operations or our products; and the integration of the Akzo Nobel refinery catalysts business or future acquisitions into our operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Albemarle Announces Third-Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., October 25  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third-quarter 2005 net income of $26.3 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, up from $0.8 million for third-quarter 2004, which included $19.5 million of special items primarily related to the July 31, 2004 acquisition of the Akzo Nobel N.V. refinery catalysts business. The Company reported net sales of $506.6 million, an increase of $92.7 million compared to 2004, due in large part to the full three months 2005 impact of the refinery catalysts business acquisition and significant pricing improvement across each segment offset, in part, by lower volumes in flame retardants.
 
Net income for third-quarter 2005 included $4.9 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, of tax benefit associated with Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code that was enacted as a part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Third-quarter 2004 net income, excluding special items, amounted to $20.3 million, or 48 cents per diluted share. Third-quarter 2004 special items are outlined in the reconciliation on page 14. Third-quarter 2005 results include two months consolidation of JBC.
 
Nine-months 2005 net income, excluding special items, was $80.5 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, compared to nine-months 2004 net income, excluding special items, of $56.1 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. Special items for nine-months 2005, which totaled $2.2 million after income taxes, included a $3.6 million after-tax gain from a retiree benefits plan change and a $0.5 million legal provision, in addition to a $0.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the refinery catalysts business acquisition.
 
Special items for nine-months 2004, which totaled $20.9 million after income taxes, are outlined in the reconciliation on page 15.
 
Average common shares used to compute third-quarter and nine-months 2005 diluted earnings per share were 48,014,000 and 47,642,000, up from 42,544,000 and 42,342,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2004, due mainly to the Company's January 2005 public offering of 4,573,000 shares of common stock.
 
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per share amounts for the third-quarters and nine-months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items.
 
Quarterly Segment Results
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales were $195.4 million, up $9.5 million versus 2004. Polymer Additives segment income for third-quarter 2005 amounted to $23.4 million, up 8.1 percent from third-quarter 2004, excluding special items, driven by overall gains in pricing that were offset, in part, by lower volumes in flame retardants and the effect of higher raw materials and energy costs.
 
Catalysts segment net sales were $173.5 million, up $67.0 million versus third-quarter 2004, due mainly to the three months net sales of the refinery catalysts business in the current period versus two months in third-quarter 2004 and higher pricing due to increased raw material costs. Catalysts segment income for third-quarter 2005 amounted to $14.8 million, down 2.2 percent from third-quarter 2004, excluding special items, driven by lower production volumes in polyolefins catalysts that were offset, in part, by the extra month of refinery catalysts business results.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales were $137.7 million, up $16.3 million versus last year, driven by improved volumes and product mix in fine chemistry services and improved pricing in performance chemicals. Fine Chemicals segment income for third-quarter 2005 amounted to $12.5 million, up 39.7 percent from third-quarter 2004, excluding special items. Improved pricing in performance chemicals and improved volumes in fine chemistry services and the reclassification impact of consolidating JBC were offset, in part, by the
 
effect of higher raw materials and energy costs and lower pricing in pharmaceutical and agricultural intermediates.
 
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses increased $5.2 million, excluding special items, versus third-quarter 2004 due mainly to the full quarter 2005 interest expense impact from the refinery catalysts acquisition debt incurred in July 31, 2004, as well as comparatively higher interest rates during the 2005 period. The corporate effective income tax rate for third-quarter 2005 amounted to 13.7 percent, down from third-quarter 2004 due largely to the Section 965 benefit described above.
 
Commentary
 
Commenting on third-quarter 2005 results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, "We are pleased that the our net sales and net income, excluding special items, are up over 20% compared to third-quarter 2004 results, and up over 40% for first nine-months 2005 compared to first nine-months 2004. Although we faced a number of challenges in third-quarter 2005, including an approximately $3.6 million pre-tax impact due primarily to production losses during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, I remain confident that we are on track to deliver solid results for the year. We are successfully working through a number of pricing initiatives to help offset the continued rampant escalation in raw material and energy costs, and I believe we will see the positive results from those initiatives in fourth-quarter 2005 and into 2006.
 
Additionally, we are pleased with the European Union's decision to exempt decabrom from its restriction on hazardous substances, a RoHS directive. This decision should remove questions regarding the safety of this critical flame retardant.
 
This quarter, we also began consolidating the results of JBC, our bromine-based Jordanian joint venture on the Dead Sea, and two months operations are reflected in this quarter's results on a line-by-line basis."

Effective August 1, 2005, the Company began consolidating its 50-percent ownership position in Jordan Bromine Company Limited ("JBC"), a Jordanian-American joint venture company that manufactures and markets bromine products extracted from the Dead SeaThe Company had previously accounted for this investment on an equity basis but changed to the consolidation method as a result of August 2005 amendments to the related joint venture agreement, upon which Albemarle management concluded that consolidation accounting for this investment was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principals in the United States ("GAAP"). This change in accounting has no impact on the Company's net income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
.
 
The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the results of operations for the third-quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 as if the consolidation of JBC had been completed as of the beginning of each of the periods presented.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional Information
 
It should be noted that net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results that are set forth on pages 14 and 15, as well as the pro forma impact of consolidating JBC on our consolidated segment income that are set forth on pages 16 and 17. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.
 
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliation of these to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at www.albemarle.com, under "Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".

Amendment and Restatement of Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
 
Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") has elected to amend its U.S. qualified retirement plan such that compensation used to determine a participant's Final Average Compensation (as defined in the U.S. qualified retirement plan) will be frozen as of December 2010, except for those who retire after December 31, 2015 or December 2020 for whom Final Average Compensation will be frozen as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2014, respectively. On December 8, 2005, the Company amended and restated the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (as amended and restated, the "SERP"). Some of the amendments to the SERP were made to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Code Section 409A"), which imposes new restrictions and requirements that must be satisfied in order to assure the deferred taxation of benefits as intended by the SERP. Generally, the amendments to the SERP, which are effective as of January 1, 2005, (1) freeze Final Average Compensation (as defined in the SERP) as of December 31, 2010 for participants who retire after December 31, 2010, other than for participants who retire after December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2020 for whom Final Average Compensation will be frozen as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2014, respectively, in conformance with the changes to the U.S. qualified retirement plan, (2) transfer all excess benefits that are linked to benefits under the Albemarle Savings Plan to the EDCP (as defined below), (3) require that payments to certain participants upon termination of employment must be delayed for six months after the termination, (4) provide that the time and form of benefits payable under the SERP must be set forth in the SERP as of the time the benefits are accrued, (5) separate benefits provided under the SERP into Excess Benefits (as defined in the SERP), Short Service Benefits (as defined in the SERP) and Supplemental Benefits (as defined in the SERP), (6) provide that Supplemental Benefits will be calculated in the same manner as Excess Benefits, except that Supplemental Benefits also take into account service with and compensation from Ethyl Corporation, (7) freeze Floyd D. Gottwald, Jr.'s benefits under the SERP as of December 31, 2002, but credit him with three additional years of service to the Company to reflect his continued service to the Company, and provide that his benefits under the SERP will be offset by his benefits payable under the Ethyl Corporation qualified and non-qualified retirement plans, (8) clarify that benefits commenced before January 1, 2005 will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the SERP in effect at the time the participant terminated employment, (9) provide that Excess Benefits, Short Service Benefits and Supplemental Benefits will be paid in a lump sum, other than the Supplemental Benefit for Floyd D. Gottwald, Jr., which will be paid as a life annuity and 100% survivor benefit with 60 monthly payments guaranteed, (10) provide that Supplemental Benefits shall be vested at all times and Short Service Benefits shall be vested upon a participant's completion of five years of service or a Change in Control (as defined in the SERP), (11) provide that Supplemental and Short Service Benefits shall be paid on the later of age 55 (or 65 if the participant has not completed 10 years of service) or separation from service and (12) provide that in the event of a Change in Control, benefits shall be immediately paid if, within 24 months after the Change in Control, a participant's employment is terminated by the Company or the participant resigns due to a change or diminution of responsibilities or compensation, a reduction of benefit level or eligibility, or refusal by a successor company to assume the participant's severance agreement.
 
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the SERP, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amendment and Restatement of Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
 
On December 8, 2005, the Company amended and restated the Albemarle Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (as amended and restated, the "EDCP"). Generally, the amendments to the EDCP were made to ensure compliance with Code Section 409A in order to assure the deferred taxation of benefits as intended by the EDCP. Code Section 409A is effective as to amounts deferred after 2004. The amendments to the EDCP, which are effective
 
as of January 1, 2005, (1) require that payments to certain participants upon termination of employment must be delayed for six months after the termination, (2) eliminate the ability of participants to receive accelerated distributions, (3) provide that any election to further defer payments must be made at least 12 months before the date the payment would otherwise be due and must be for at least an additional five years, (4) require that account balances under $50,000 at termination must be paid in a lump sum, (5) provide for a make-up of benefits under the Company's qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans that would otherwise be lost solely as a result of elective deferrals made under the EDCP and (6) provide that, upon termination of the EDCP, benefits under the EDCP may be paid out only if the Company terminates and pays out all benefits under all other non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
 
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the EDCP, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation adopted the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") effective April 26, 2000. This Plan represents an amendment and restatement of the Albemarle Corporation Excess Benefit Plan and the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan which were originally adopted by the Board on February 8, 1994. The Excess Benefit Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan were amended effective April 26, 2000, to simplify the Plans' administration with respect to the calculation of benefits and to clarify the benefits provided to certain employees. In addition, effective as of April 26, 2000 the Excess Benefit Plan and the Supplemental Plan were merged. The resulting plan was renamed the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
 
The Board believes that the adoption of the Plan will assist it in attracting and retaining those employees, whose judgment, abilities and experience will contribute to the Company's success.
 
The Plan is intended to be a plan that is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing supplemental retirement benefits for a "select group of management or highly compensated employees" (as such phrase is used in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended). The Plan must be administered and construed in a manner that is consistent with that intent. The Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, and any and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
 
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
 
(c) General.
 
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of

The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Albemarle Announces Fourth-Quarter and Fiscal-Year 2005 Unaudited Results
 
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., January 25  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth-quarter 2005 net income of $32.2 million, or 67 cents per share, up from $19.6 million, or 46 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2004. Excluding net special item charges of ($1.8 million), or 4 cents per share, net income rose 73 percent to $34.0 million, or 71 cents per share, from $19.6 million, or 46 cents per share, in the same period last year.
 
The Company reported record quarterly sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 totaling $588.2 million, up $137.1 million from fourth-quarter 2004. The increase was due primarily to strong sales in our Catalysts segment due to higher sales in refinery catalysts and continued pricing improvement in certain businesses across our Polymer Additives and Fine Chemicals segments. Record net sales for year 2005 were $2.1 billion as compared with $1.5 billion for year 2004, a 39 percent increase, due mainly to our July 2004 refinery catalysts acquisition.
 
Net income for year 2005 was $114.9 million, or $2.41 per share, compared to $54.8 million, or $1.29 per share, for year 2004. Excluding special items, net income for year 2005 was $114.4 million, or $2.40 per share, versus $75.7 million, or $1.78 per share, for year 2004. Special items for year 2005, which totaled $0.4 million after income taxes, or 1 cent per share, are outlined on page 9. Special items for year 2004, which totaled ($20.9) million after income taxes, or 49 cents per share, related primarily to acquisition-related costs of our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business, are also outlined in the reconciliation on page 13.
 
The effective tax rate for fourth-quarter 2005 was favorably impacted due primarily to the realization of foreign tax credits related to tax structuring activities as well as certain tax elections made to reflect the permanent reinvestment of foreign joint venture earnings, and the reduction of corporate income tax rates in the Netherlands.
 
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per share amounts for the fourth-quarters and years 2005 and 2004 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items and net debt.
 
Quarterly Segment Results
 
Polymer Additives segment net sales for fourth-quarter 2005 were $199.9 million, up $12.3 million versus fourth-quarter 2004 due mainly to higher pricing, offset in part, by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange. Polymer Additives segment income for fourth-quarter 2005 amounted to $22.9 million, up 19.5 percent from fourth-quarter 2004 due mainly to higher pricing, that was offset, in part, by lower production volumes, higher energy costs and the overall unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.
 
Catalysts segment net sales for fourth-quarter 2005 were $244.0 million, up $114.4 million versus fourth-quarter 2004, due mainly to strong sales in hydroprocessing catalysts. Catalysts segment income for fourth-quarter 2005 amounted to $31.8 million, up 122.5 percent from fourth-quarter 2004 due mainly to higher sales in refinery catalysts and a $3.2 million curtailment gain related to a pension change in the Netherlands. Increases in raw materials, primarily metals, and energy costs were substantial, but in general, were mitigated by price increases.
 
Fine Chemicals segment net sales for fourth-quarter 2005 were $144.3 million, up $10.5 million versus fourth-quarter 2004 due mainly to higher pricing and volumes in performance chemicals offset, in part, by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange. Fine Chemicals segment income for fourth-quarter 2005 amounted to $7.2 million, down $5.5 million from fourth-quarter 2004, due mainly to a $3.5 million special charge related to the closing of a sea-water bromine facility in France, lower seasonal volumes in agricultural actives, along with higher manufacturing costs related to a planned plant shutdown for automation improvements. Improved pricing and volumes mostly offset substantial raw material and energy costs.
 
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses increased $2.5 million versus fourth-quarter 2004 due mainly to higher interest rates. Our fourth-quarter 2005 income tax rate versus fourth-quarter 2004 was impacted significantly due to the benefit of certain tax items in the fourth-quarter 2005 period as mentioned above. Our fourth-quarter 2004 income tax rate benefited from the reversal of certain income tax reserves and the net favorable effect of adjustments associated with the reconciliation of certain tax accounts.
 
Commentary
 
Commenting on fourth-quarter 2005 results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation stated, "I am pleased to announce record sales and outstanding earnings per share results in the fourth quarter. We faced many challenges in 2005 and our team met them very successfully. We implemented pricing initiatives as well as specific cost reduction measures to mitigate the increasing pressure of inflated raw materials and energy costs. In addition, we generated strong cash flow this quarter that enabled us to reduce our net debt by over $50 million. We believe we have positioned ourselves for growth and financial stability and we are poised to accomplish a very positive and rewarding 2006."
 
Earnings Call
 
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on January 26, 2006, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products.

Additional Information
 
Net income, excluding special items, is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results that are set forth on pages 12 and 13. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income, excluding special items, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP for the fourth quarter and years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
 
Net debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure. We define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us (or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us), less cash and cash equivalents. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the third and fourth quarters ended September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
 
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliation of these to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".

Exhibit 99.1
 
RICHMOND, VirginiaMarch 20, 2006Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) announced today that the arbitral tribunal has ruled in favor of Albemarle France SAS and Albemarle PPC, wholly owned affiliates of Albemarle Corporation, in the action brought by them against Sanofi-Aventis before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), in Paris, France concerning certain environmental matters at Albemarle PPC's site in Thann, France.
In 1992, Albemarle France SAS purchased 100 percent of the stock of the company that is now known as Albemarle PPC from Rhone-Poulenc SA, the predecessor-in-interest to Sanofi-Aventis. In the purchase agreement, Sanofi-Aventis retained liability for and indemnified Albemarle France SAS and its affiliates against costs associated with certain environmental liabilities at the site. The arbitral tribunal upheld Albemarle France SAS's position that the obligations of the contract, including those dealing with Sanofi-Aventis' liability related to mercury remediation and decontamination at the site, are enforceable.
"We are pleased that the arbitrators affirmed our position that Sanofi-Aventis is obligated to comply with the terms of our original agreement," said Lloyd Crasto, President of Albemarle PPC. "We will take this ruling into consideration as we continue to review our options for addressing the operational and financial challenges that the Thann facility faces."

The Non-Employee Director Stock Plan provides for the grant of shares of the Company's common stock to each non-employee who is a director of the Company on the effective date of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan or who thereafter becomes a director of the Company (each, a "participant"). On the first business days of January, April, July and October of each calendar year, the Company will grant to each participant 100 shares (or such other amount as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time) of the Company's common stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to increase the amount of shares of the Company's common stock issued to each participant during the calendar year, but in no event shall more than 1,000 shares of the Company's common stock be issued to a participant during any calendar year. In the event of a change in capital, shares of capital stock, or any special distribution to the shareholders of the Company, the Board of Directors will make equitable adjustments in the number of shares of the Company's common stock that have been, or thereafter may be, granted to participants. The maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued under the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan is 75,000 shares.
The Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, but no such amendment shall (1) increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be granted to any participant (except as described above) or (2) increase the total number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be granted under the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan; provided, however, that the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan may not be amended more than once every six months other than to comply with changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. Any amendment of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan must comply with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
The Company's Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee will administer the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee will interpret all provisions of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, establish administrative regulations to further the purpose of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and take any other action necessary for the proper operation of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. All decisions and acts of the Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee shall be final and binding upon all participants in the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan.
A copy of the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

The non-employee's director fee will include a cash component equal to $63,200 per year, paid on a quarterly basis, and a stock component equal to 400 shares of the Company's common stock, paid on a quarterly basis, in accordance with the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 24, 2006, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at www.albemarle.com.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding certain special items. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Announces Record Second-Quarter 2006 Results
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., July 24  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported record second-quarter 2006 net income of $43.3 million, or 89 cents per share, up from $32.1 million, or 67 cents per share, for second-quarter 2005, due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments and its joint ventures. Excluding special items, second quarter 2005 net income was $29.0 million, or 60 cents per share. The Company reported quarterly net sales in the second quarter of 2006 totaling $569 million, up $66 million, a 13 percent increase from second-quarter 2005.
Net income for the first half of 2006 was $77.7 million, or $1.60 per share, up from $56.4 million, or $1.19 per share, for the first half of 2005 due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. Excluding special items, first half 2005 net income was $54.2 million or $1.14 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2006 were $1.176 billion, up $163 million, a 16 percent increase from the first half of 2005.
Commenting on second-quarter 2006 results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation stated, "I am pleased to announce record quarterly net income for the Company on strong net sales. Our sales increased 13 percent while our earnings rose 35 percent, reflecting the success we have had achieving value for our products and services in the market. All three business units showed improved earnings and margins compared to the same period last year. Our team is performing well building Albemarle's innovation and service model, addressing under-performing assets, mitigating costs, and working with customers to introduce new products. We had a strong first half of the year, and while we recognize the expected deceleration in the domestic economy, we expect demand and pricing for our products to remain robust in the second half of the year."
Quarterly Segment Results
The Polymer Additives segment recorded net sales for second-quarter 2006 of $228.6 million, up $24.1 million, or 12 percent, versus second-quarter 2005. Our mineral flame retardant portfolio saw both volume and net sales improvements. Net sales improved in both brominated flame retardants and our stabilizers and curatives on flat volumes. Polymer Additives segment income for second-quarter 2006 amounted to $39.2 million, up $10.9 million, or 38 percent, versus second-quarter 2005, due mainly to higher pricing, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding the special item gain of $2.2 million in second-quarter 2005, Polymer Additives segment income for second-quarter 2006 improved 50 percent.
The Catalysts segment recorded net sales for second-quarter 2006 of $194.0 million, up $46.7 million, or 32 percent, versus second-quarter 2005, due mainly to higher pricing and increased volume in refinery catalysts (both FCC and HPC catalysts), offset in part by slightly lower volumes in polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for second-quarter 2006 amounted to $29.5 million, up $5.2 million, or 21 percent, from second-quarter 2005, due to higher pricing and increased volume offset by increased raw material cost. In addition, strong performance in the Catalysts joint ventures contributed $9.8 million in second-quarter 2006, a $4.1 million improvement over second-quarter 2005. Excluding the special item gain of $0.6 million in second-quarter 2005, Catalysts segment income for second-quarter 2006 improved 24 percent.
Fine Chemicals segment net sales for second-quarter 2006 were $146.2 million, down $4.8 million, or 3 percent, versus second-quarter 2005. Fine Chemicals segment income for second-quarter 2006 was $13.8 million, down $1.1 million, or 7 percent, from second-quarter 2005, due mainly to increased raw material and manufacturing costs, partially offset by improved pricing. Excluding the special item gain of $2.2 million in second-quarter 2005, Fine Chemicals segment income for second-quarter 2006 improved 9 percent.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $12.0 million versus second-quarter 2005 of $10.1 million due mainly to higher interest rates and increased levels of debt after the consolidation of our Jordan bromine joint venture. During the quarter we recorded a net charge of approximately 3 cents per share, after tax, related to a foreign exchange adjustment on foreign denominated debt at our consolidated Jordan bromine joint venture. This charge is included in our Other (Expense) Income line item, with a partial offset in Minority Interests in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries. Our net debt decreased approximately $60 million from March 31, 2006 reflecting strong cash flows. Our second-quarter 2006 effective income tax rate was 25.3 percent.
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per share amounts for the second-quarters and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items and net debt.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on July 25, 2006, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2005 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Additional Information
It should be noted that net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005.
Net debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure. We define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us (or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us), less cash and cash equivalents. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the first and second quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, respectively.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Investor Relations."

"We are very pleased that we were able to complete this transaction in a timely fashion. This is a positive step for Thann and for Albemarle's fine chemicals business," said John Nicols, Albemarle Vice President, Fine Chemicals.
Albemarle expects to take a pre-tax charge of approximately $90 to $95 million related to this transaction in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Albemarle's previously announced consultation process with the works council at Thann to potentially cease operations at this site has been cancelled.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 18, 2006, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on October 19, 2006, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at www.albemarle.com.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding the charge that relates to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility and certain other special items. Net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Announces Third-Quarter 2006 Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., - October 18  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported record third-quarter 2006 net income, excluding the charge that relates to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility, of $60.7 million, or $1.25 per-share, up from $26.3 million, or 55 cents per-share, for third-quarter 2005 due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. Including the $89.2 million ($58.4 million after income taxes, or $1.20 per-share) Thann charge, net income for third-quarter 2006 was $2.3 million, or 5 cents per-share. The Company reported record quarterly net sales in the third-quarter of 2006 totaling $607.8 million, up $101.2 million, a 20 percent increase from third-quarter 2005.
Net income, excluding the Thann charge and other special items, for the nine months of 2006 was $138.4 million, or $2.85 per-share, up from $80.5 million, or $1.69 per-share, for the nine months of 2005 due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. Including the Thann charge and other special items, net income for the nine months of 2006 was $80.0 million, or $1.65 per-share, down from $82.7 million, or $1.74 per-share, for the nine months of 2005. Net sales for the nine months of 2006 were $1.784 billion, up $265 million, a 17 percent increase from the nine months of 2005.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation stated, "Our team executed flawlessly this quarter. All three of our segments saw continued revenue growth and improved profitability, with both Catalysts and Polymer Additives achieving segment income margins above our 15% corporate goal. Our strategic focus on improvements to our Fine Chemicals segment allowed us to complete the disposition of our Thann, France facility and acquire additional cGMP capacity through our DSM fine chemicals acquisition. Both of these were critical steps to improve the profitability and sustainability of this segment. Overall, demand and pricing for our products remains strong. Our fourth quarter has begun on a strong note and we look forward to another successful year in 2007."
Quarterly Segment Results
The Polymer Additives segment recorded net sales for third-quarter 2006 of $240.7 million, up $45.4 million, or 23 percent, versus third-quarter 2005. Our mineral flame retardant and brominated flame retardant portfolios saw both volume and pricing improvements. Net sales improved in our stabilizers and curatives
 
business on flat volumes. Polymer Additives segment income for third-quarter 2006 amounted to $38.6 million, up $16.8 million, or 77 percent, versus third-quarter 2005, due mainly to higher pricing, partially offset by increased raw material and manufacturing costs.
The Catalysts segment recorded net sales for third-quarter 2006 of $217.4 million, up $43.9 million, or 25 percent, versus third-quarter 2005, due mainly to higher pricing and volumes in refinery catalysts (both FCC and HPC catalysts) and higher pricing in polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for third-quarter 2006 amounted to $38.2 million, up $23.5 million, or 159 percent, from third-quarter 2005, due to higher pricing and volumes partially offset by increased raw material cost.
Fine Chemicals segment net sales for third-quarter 2006 were $149.7 million, up $12.0 million, or 9 percent, versus third-quarter 2005. Excluding the Thann charge, Fine Chemicals segment income for third-quarter 2006 was $16.2 million, up $4.1 million, or 34 percent, from third-quarter 2005, due mainly to improved pricing partially offset by reduced volumes and increased raw material and manufacturing costs. Including the Thann divestiture charge of $89.2 million, the Fine Chemicals segment loss for third-quarter 2006 was $73.0 million.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $10.8 million versus third-quarter 2005 of $10.9 million. Our net debt decreased $5.4 million from June 30, 2006 and $73.7 million from December 31, 2005 due mainly to strong cash flows from operations partially offset by cash outlays related to the Thann facility divestiture and the acquisition of the DSM South Haven, Michigan plant. Our third-quarter 2006 effective income tax rate on a reported basis, excluding the tax benefit related to the Thann divestiture charge, was 10.8 percent.
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per-share amounts for the third-quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items and net debt.

The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on October 19, 2006, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products.

Additional Information
It should be noted that net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.
Net debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure. We define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us (or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us), less cash and cash equivalents. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, as of December 31, 2005 and for the second and third quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, respectively.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at

(e)
Approval of Severance Compensation Agreements
On December 13, 2006, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") approved a severance compensation program pursuant to which it will enter into severance compensation agreements (the "Severance Compensation Agreements") with respect to certain senior executive officers, initially including Mark C. Rohr, John M. Steitz, Richard J. Diemer, Jr., Luther C. Kissam, IV and Jack P. Harsh (each, an "Executive"). The Severance Compensation Agreements will replace compensation arrangements with four of the five Executives that contain change in control provisions. The fifth Executive does not have a similar compensation arrangement.
The Severance Compensation Agreements have terms extending through December 31, 2007 and will be automatically extended for additional one-year terms unless either party notifies the other of the desire not to extend.
The Severance Compensation Agreements provide that, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company, upon death after a notice of termination of employment has been received, upon termination by the Company other than for cause, or upon resignation for good reason (as defined in the Severance Compensation Agreements), each Executive will be entitled to (i) base salary and vacation pay accrued through the termination date, (ii) accrued annual cash bonus, (iii) a lump sum severance payment further described below, (iv) tax gross-up payments for any excise taxes imposed on the Executive in connection with payments made under the relevant Severance Compensation Agreement, not to exceed $5,000,000 with respect to the chief executive officer or $3,000,000 with respect to all others, (v) immediate vesting of any outstanding but unvested stock options and restricted stock, (vi) payment of earned performance units for completed performance periods, (vii) payment of performance units for the then current performance period, calculated based on actual performance for the completed portion of the performance period and the target amount for the remainder of the unfinished performance period, (viii) the elimination of certain offsets for the short service benefits under the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), and (ix) other insurance and counseling benefits.
The severance payments referenced in clause (iii) of the previous paragraph consist of the product of (x) a multiple, which in any event shall not be less than one (1), ranging from a number calculated based upon the number of days remaining before the Executive's normally anticipated retirement date (defined in accordance with the Company's pension plan) to two (2), multiplied by (y) the sum of the Executive's annual base salary and the greater of (A) the amount of the Executive's actual annual bonus for the year preceding the date of the Change in Control and (B) the amount of the Executive's target bonus for the year in which the Change in Control occurs, and are subject to reduction if the severance payments exceed certain Internal Revenue Code limits by up to $100,000.
The severance payment will also be offset by a payment to the Executive for a non-competition agreement further described below. Each Executive will be required to sign a one
 
year non-competition agreement for which the Executive will receive consideration equal to one year's base and bonus compensation and which, if materially breached, will entitle the Company to recover the payment.
For purposes of the Severance Compensation Agreements, "Change in Control" shall mean (i) any person or group, as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, becoming, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company; provided, however, in the event such person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more, and less than 30%, of such voting securities, the directors who were directors prior to December 13, 2006 or whose nomination or election was recommended or approved by directors who were directors prior to December 13, 2006 ("Continuing Directors") determine by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Continuing Directors that such event does not constitute a Change in Control, (ii) as a result of a reorganization, merger, share exchange or consolidation (each, a "Business Combination"), contested election of directors, or a combination of any such items, the Continuing Directors cease to constitute a majority of the Company's or its successor's board of directors within two years of the last of such transaction(s), or (iii) the shareholders of the Company approve a Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions, one of which exceptions is that all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Company's outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such Business Combination own more than 60% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors resulting from the Business Combination in substantially the same proportions as immediately prior to such Business Combination.

The term of the Severance Pay Plan is indefinite, but it may be amended or ended at any time prior to a Change in Control and, after any such Change in Control, no amendment or termination shall be effective with respect to any employee unless such employee consents thereto in writing. The Severance Pay Plan shall expire two years after the date of any such Change in Control.

The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the First Amendment to the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.7 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amendment to Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
On December 13, 2006, the Company adopted the First Amendment to the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Executive Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides a supplemental benefit of 5% of compensation in excess of amounts which may be recognized under the Company's tax-qualified Savings Plan, for eligible employees hired after March 31, 2004, who are not eligible to participate in the Company's defined benefit pension plan. Under the First Amendment to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, the 5% is increased to 6% commencing in the year in which occurs the employee's 10
th
anniversary of employment, and to 7% in the year in which occurs the employee's 20
th
anniversary of employment.
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the First Amendment to the Albemarle Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.8 and incorporated herein by reference.
Adoption of Amended and Restated Benefits Protection Trust
On December 13, 2006, the Company also adopted the Amended and Restated Albemarle Corporation Benefits Protection Trust (the "Benefits Protection Trust"). The Benefits Protection Trust is a grantor trust, with Merrill Lynch Trust Company FSB as Trustee. It allows the Company to fund, from time to time, benefits under its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, SERP and Severance Pay Plan, as well as payments that may become due under individual severance agreements. It also allows the Company to fund a Benefits Protection Account which can provide funds to allow participants in those plans and agreements to pursue claims against the Company if benefits due them are not paid after a Change in Control.
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Amended and Restated Benefits Protection Trust, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.9 and incorporated herein by reference

2007 Base Salaries
On December 12, 2006, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") approved the following 2007 base salaries, which will become effective as of January 1, 2007, for the Company's named executive officers (the "Named Executive Officers"): Mark C.

2007 Incentive Plan Target Bonuses
On December 12, 2006, the Committee approved the 2007 target percentages for the executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Company's 2003 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to two times a target percentage of their respective
 
base salaries if certain criteria to be established by the Committee are met for 2007. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (80%); John M. Steitz (60%); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. (60%); Luther C. Kissam, IV(60%); and William M. Gottwald (60%).
The Incentive Plan also contemplates the possibility of the payment of additional discretionary incentives to the Named Executive Officers, but only in the event that individual's performance merits consideration of such additional incentives.

Payments under this clause (ii) shall be made to you not later than five (5) days after the Date of Termination.

For the purpose of this Paragraph 2a(ii), "Incentive Compensation Program" means any of the Incentive Compensation Plans defined in Paragraph 1f and any other plan or program for the payment of incentive compensation, variable compensation, bonus, benefits or awards for which you were, or your position was, eligible to participate; "Incentive Compensation" means any compensation, variable compensation, bonus, benefit or award paid or payable under an Incentive Compensation Program; and "Variable Compensation Year" means a calendar or fiscal plan year of an Incentive Compensation Program.

(b) If you are not eligible for the retiree medical plans, you will no longer continue to participate in the Corporation's medical benefit plans, except for COBRA, and (i) the Corporation shall provide you with a cash payment in an amount equal to the amount required by you to pay for coverage under COBRA for the first eighteen (18) months following your loss of medical coverage, and thereafter, (ii) the Corporation shall, for the subsequent six (6) months, purchase for you, at its cost, a policy of medical insurance providing benefits substantially similar to the benefits you would have received under the Corporation's medical benefit plans.

(b) the greater of the amount of your actual annual variable compensation payment you received for the year preceding the date on which the Change in Control occurs and your target variable compensation for the year in which the Change in Control occurs, (whether or not such award was includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes).
The Severance Payment shall be reduced by the amount paid to you under paragraph 7(c) below.
 
If the payments or benefits to which you will be entitled under this Agreement would cause you to be liable for the federal excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute payments" under Code Section 4999, then the following provisions shall apply.
If such payments or benefits exceed 2.99 times your "Base Amount" ( as defined in Code Section 280G) (the "Parachute Limit"), by the lesser of (A) 10% of the Parachute Limit, and (B) $100,000, then your Severance Payment (but not other payments or benefits under this Agreement) shall be reduced by an amount so that your payments and benefits under this Agreement are 2.99 times the Base Amount.
Whether payments to you are to be reduced, and the extent to which they are to be so reduced, will be determined by the Corporation in good faith and the Corporation will notify you in writing of its determination. Any such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis of the Corporation's determination. If you accept the Corporation's determination, you shall so advise the Corporation of your determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation. If you object to such determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation, the Corporation will retain, at its expense, a nationally recognized public accounting firm, employment consulting firm or law firm selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to you to review the matter. Such firm shall meet with you and your representatives and the Corporation and its representatives and thereafter render its written opinion as to the extent, if any, that in such firm's reasonable judgment the payments and benefits otherwise due to you hereunder must be reduced hereunder. The decision of such firm concerning the extent of any required reduction in such payments and benefits shall be final and binding on both you and the Corporation.
 
(a) For purposes of this subparagraph (ix), the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
 
 
(b) Except as provided in subparagraph (viii) above, in the event it shall be determined that a Payment would be subject to an Excise Tax, then you shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by you of Income Tax and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, you retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment. However, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay you no more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) under this clause (b).
(c) All determinations required to be made under this subsection (ix), including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at
 
such determination, shall be made by the public accounting or actuarial consulting firm that is retained by the Corporation as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the "Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and to you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation (collectively, the "Determination"). In the event that the Firm is serving as accountant, auditor or consultant for the individual, entity or group affecting the Change in Control, you may appoint another nationally recognized public Firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which Firm shall then be referred to as the Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this subsection (viii), shall be paid by the Corporation to you within ten (10) days of your receipt of the Determination. If the Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by you, you may request the Firm to furnish you with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on your applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. The Determination by the Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and you. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section (ix)(d) below and you thereafter are required to make payment of any Excise Tax or Income Tax, the Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for your benefit.
(d) You shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment or the Underpayment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after you are informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. You shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which you give such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies you in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, you shall:
 
 
 
 
 
(e) If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to Section (ix)(d) above, you become entitled to receive, and receive, any refund with respect to such claim, you shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of Section (ix)(d)) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to Section (ix)(d), a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claims and the Corporation does not notify you in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall be offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
 
b. . During any period prior to the Date of Termination and during the term of this Agreement that you are unable to perform your full-time duties with the Corporation, whether as a result of your Total Disability or as a result of a physical or mental disability that is not total or is not permanent and therefore is not a Total Disability, you shall continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all other compensation and benefits that are payable or provided under the Corporation's benefit plans, including its disability plans. After the Date of Termination, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program, insurance and other applicable programs. The compensation and benefits, other than salary, payable or provided pursuant to this Paragraph 2b shall be the greater of (x) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control and (y) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect at the time the compensation and benefits are paid.
Payments While Disabled
c. . If your employment shall be terminated by the Corporation for Cause or by you other than with Good Reason for Resignation, the Corporation shall pay you your full base salary and accrued vacation pay then in effect through the Date of Termination, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
Payments if Termination for Cause, or by You Except With Good Reason
 
Termination is given plus any benefits or awards which have been earned or become payable but which have not yet been paid to you. You shall receive any payment due under this subsection c. on your Date of Termination. Thereafter the Corporation shall have no further obligation to you under this Agreement.
d. . If your employment shall be terminated by your Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program and insurance programs then in effect except that if your death occurs after the execution of a definitive agreement which results in a Change in Control, then you shall be entitled to the benefits under this Agreement as if the Corporation issued you a Notice of Termination terminating your employment thirty (30) days after a Change in Control.
After Retirement or Death
3. .
Vesting Upon a Change in Control
a. Upon a Change in Control, all unvested stock options and restricted stock held by you under the Incentive Compensation Programs shall immediately vest and be non-forfeitable.
b. With respect to any outstanding Performance Units granted to you under the Incentive Compensation Programs which have not then vested and been paid to you, then upon a Change in Control the following provisions shall apply to such Performance Units:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. . This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2007; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2008 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless, not later than September 30 of the preceding year, the Corporation or you shall have given notice that it or you do not wish to extend this Agreement. Notwithstanding any such notice by the Corporation or you not to extend the Agreement, if a Change in Control shall have occurred prior to such termination of this Agreement, the attempted termination of this Agreement shall be deemed ineffective and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In any event, the term of this Agreement shall expire on the second (2nd) anniversary of the date of the Change in Control. This Agreement shall terminate if your employment is terminated by you or the Corporation prior to a Change in Control.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Successor" shall mean any person that purchases all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or the Surviving Corporation (and Parent Corporation, if applicable) or obtains or succeeds to, or has the practical ability to control (either immediately or with the passage of time), the Corporation's business directly, by merger or consolidation, or indirectly, by purchase of voting securities of the Corporation or by acquisition of rights to vote voting securities of the Corporation or otherwise, including but not limited to any person or group that acquires the beneficial ownership or voting rights described in Paragraph 1a(ii).

Exhibit 10.6
 
 
 
The purpose of The Albemarle Corporation Severance Pay Plan ("Plan") is to provide a period of continued income to certain employees who are terminated by certain actions of Albemarle Corporation (the "Corporation") for no fault of the employee.
 
Only those employees who are located in the United States, including those on expat assignments outside the United States, and are grade 18 or above are eligible for inclusion under this Plan. The Chief Executive Officer of Albemarle shall nominate employees for inclusion under this Plan and the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Albemarle shall have the authority to designate which of those employees may participate in this Plan and such designation shall be on file with the Administrator of this Plan. Following a Change in Control, any employee designated for inclusion under this Plan may not be removed from this Plan.
Those employees who have Severance Compensation Agreements providing for certain benefits following a Change in Control shall be eligible for participation in this Plan but are eligible for benefits only under the conditions of Section III.A. below.
 
 
The "elimination of the employee's position" means that the responsibilities of the employee have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the remaining responsibilities no longer constitute a complete work assignment and any remaining duties are reassigned to a number of other positions, resulting in a net reduction of required positions.
 
For purposes of this paragraph B: (i) termination for "cause" shall mean termination of employment for willfully engaging in conduct demonstrably and materially injurious to the Corporation, monetarily or otherwise. No act, or failure to act, shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the action or omission was in the best interest of the Corporation; and
(ii) severance payments will NOT be paid to an employee:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Severance Pay for an eligible employee terminated pursuant to Section III.A above shall be equal to the sum of (i) one year of the employee's base pay in effect at the time of termination of employment, and (ii) the target cash bonus for the employee for the year in which the employee is terminated.
(b) Severance Pay for an eligible employee terminated pursuant to Section III.B above shall be equal to the sum of (i) the greater of the employee's base salary prior to the date of termination and the employee's base salary immediately prior to the Change in Control, and (ii) the greater of the amount of the employee's actual cash bonus for the year preceding the date on which the Change in Control occurs and the employee's target bonus for the year in which the Change in Control occurs.
Payments of Severance Pay shall be made by the Corporation in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after termination of employment.
In case of death, any unpaid allowance will be paid out in the following order: to the surviving spouse, surviving children or the estate.
 
 
 
 
The provisions of the Patent and Confidentiality Agreement previously signed by a Participant in this Plan shall continue to apply following a termination of employment.
 
The Corporation expects to continue this Plan indefinitely, but reserves the right to amend or end it at any time prior to a Change in Control. After a Change in Control, no amendment or termination shall be effective with respect to any employee unless such employee consents in writing thereto.
For purposes of this Plan, the term "Change in Control" shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Albemarle Corporation 2003 Incentive Plan, or any successor plan.
This Plan shall expire two (2) years after the date of a Change in Control.
 
 
 
 
 
If any claim is denied in whole or in part, the employee or beneficiary will receive written notification within 90 days, including the reasons for the denial, reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the denial was based, information about additional material needed to pursue the claim and an explanation of the claim appeal procedure. Within 90 days, the employee or beneficiary may submit a written request for reconsideration of the claim to:
 
The Plan Administrator will make its decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the appeal (unless special circumstances require an extension of time up to one hundred twenty (120) days and will give a written notice of its decision which specifies the reasons for its decision. The Plan Administrator will decide whether a hearing will be held on the claim and will notify the employee or beneficiary at least 14 days before the hearing, if one is to be held.
 
A participant in the Plan is entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:
 
 
 
In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of an employee benefit plan. The people who operate this Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including the Employer, or any other person, may fire an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee in any way to prevent the employee from obtaining a benefit or exercising the employee's rights under ERISA. If a claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, the employee must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. The employee has the right to have the Plan review and reconsider the employee's claim.
Under ERISA, there are steps the employee can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if the employee request materials from the Plan and does not receive them within 30 days, the employee may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay the employee up to $110 a day until the employee receive the
 
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If the employee have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the employee may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if an employee is discriminated against for asserting the employee's rights, the employee may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employee may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If the employee is successful, the court may order the person the employee has sued to pay these costs and fees. If the employee loses, the court may order the employee to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds the employee's claim is frivolous. If an employee have questions about the Plan, the employee should contact the Plan Administrator. If the employee has any questions about this statement or about the employee's rights under ERISA, the employee should contact the nearest office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

WHEREAS, the Trustee is not a party to the Protected Plans and makes no representations with respect thereto, and all representations and recitals with respect to the Protected Plans shall be deemed to be those of the Company;

The Company shall notify the Committee and the Trustee in writing of the occurrence of any event described in Exhibit C, as soon as practicable after the Company first learns of such event. The Committee and the Trustee may conclusively rely upon such notice from the Company in performing any of their obligations or taking any action under this Agreement which is dependent upon a Change In Control having occurred. The Trustee and the Committee may also request that the Company furnish evidence to determine, or to enable the Committee to determine, whether a Change In Control has occurred. The Company's or Committee's determination whether a Change In Control has occurred shall be binding and conclusive on all Participants.
 
. (a) The Company hereby establishes with the Trustee and the Trustee hereby accepts a trust consisting of the following property:
SECOND:
Creation of Trust
(1) such cash or other property acceptable to the Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to time as contributions under the SERP, together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter called the "SERP Account");
(2) such cash or other property acceptable to the Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to time as contributions under the EDCP, together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter called the "EDCP Account");
(3) such cash or other property acceptable to the Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to time earmarked to pay cash payments owed under the Severance Agreements, together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter called the "Severance Agreements Account")
(4) such cash or other property acceptable to the Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to time earmarked to pay benefits under the Severance Plan, together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter called the "Severance Plan Account") and
 
(5) such cash or other property acceptable to the Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to time earmarked for the Benefits Protection Account, together with the earnings thereon, and realized and unrealized gains (net of any losses) attributable thereto, (all of which is hereinafter called the "Benefits Protection Account"). Neither the cash nor any other property held in the Benefits Protection Account shall be available for payment of benefits to participants and beneficiaries under the Protected Plans.
(b) The Trustee or the Investment Director, if applicable, for investment purposes only, may commingle all Trust assets and treat them as a single fund, but the records of the Trustee or the Investment Director, if applicable, at all times shall show the percentages of the Trust allocable to the SERP Account, the EDCP Account, the Severance Agreements Account, the Benefits Protection Account and such other Account(s) as may subsequently be established under this Trust (herein referred to collectively as the "Accounts").
(c) The assets of the Accounts shall be used to discharge the obligations of the Company as follows:
(1) The assets of the SERP Account shall be used to discharge the obligations of the SERP.
(2) The assets of the EDCP Account shall be used to discharge the obligations of the EDCP.
(3) The assets of the Severance Agreements Account shall be used to discharge the obligations of the Severance Agreements.
(4) The assets of the Benefits Protection Account may be used as set forth in Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH.
 
(5) Prior to a Change In Control, the Company may direct the Trustee to reallocate the assets of an Account to one or more other Accounts.
(6) After a Change In Control, the Committee may direct the Trustee to transfer the assets of an Account to one or more other Accounts if either (i) the Protected Plan for which such Account was established has expired or terminated, and all liabilities with regard to such expired or terminated Protected Plan have been satisfied pursuant to Paragraph (d) of Article FIFTEENTH, or (ii) the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that the remaining assets of such Account, after such transfer, are reasonably sufficient to cover the liabilities of the Protected Plan for which such Account was established.
(d) The Company and the Trustee agree that the Trust created herein shall not be revocable by the Company or by any successor thereto, and is intended to be a grantor trust under the provisions of Sections 671 through 678 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
(e) The Company may add funds to the Trust at any time and shall designate the Account to which such funds shall be credited. Any such additional funds shall also be available to pay the fees and expenses of the Trustee and/or the Committee.
(f) Upon a Change In Control, the Company shall, as soon as possible, but in no event longer than ten (10) days following the Change In Control, make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount that is sufficient to pay the Participants or beneficiaries the benefits to which the Participants or beneficiaries would be entitled pursuant to the terms of the EDCP as of the date of the Change In Control. The amount of such irrevocable contribution shall be determined by the Company's independent actuary engaged by the Company prior to the Change In Control. If no actuary has been so appointed, the Company's actuary under its qualified defined benefit plan shall be the actuary for purposes of this provision.
 
. (a) Subject to Paragraph (b) of Article SIXTEENTH hereof, the Trustee, from time to time upon receipt of direction from the Company prior to a Change In Control, and from the Committee after a Change In Control, shall make payments from the Trust, as specified in such direction to such persons, in such manner and in such amounts as the Company or the Committee, as the case may be, shall direct, and amounts paid pursuant to such direction (or in accordance with Article SEVENTH hereof) thereafter no longer shall constitute a part of the Trust.
THIRD:
Payments from the Trust
(b) The Company may, from time to time prior to a Change In Control, furnish the Trustee with certain information regarding the participants and beneficiaries under the Protected Plans and the determination of the benefits under the Protected Plans (hereinafter referred to as "Participant Data"). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the Participant Data provided by the Company prior to a Change In Control, and shall have no duty to verify the accuracy thereof. The Company shall, after a Change In Control and upon the request of the Committee, furnish the Committee with Participant Data at least once each Protected Plan Year. Such Participant Data shall include, to the extent applicable, (1) names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers of each participant and beneficiary in the Protected Plans; (2) the amount and form of benefits under each of the Protected Plans of each participant and beneficiary if such participant would retire or die as of either the last day of such Protected Plan Year or the last day of the Protected Plan Year in which such Participant attained age 60; (3) earnings history, compensation (cash and deferred) and bonus history of each participant; (4) a schedule of the estimated yearly cash payments under the Protected Plans; and (5) any other information regarding the Protected Plan which the Committee may reasonably request or which the Committee may deem necessary to administer this Trust.
 
After a Change In Control and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall, upon receipt of direction from the Committee, to the extent funds are available in the Trust for such purpose, make payments to participants and beneficiaries in such manner and in such amounts as the Committee shall determine they are entitled to be paid under the Protected Plans based on the most recent Participant Data furnished to the Committee by the Company prior to a Change In Control and any supplemental information furnished to the Committee by a participant or beneficiary upon which the Committee may reasonably rely in making such determination. The Committee may make such reasonable inquiry of the Company as is necessary to determine whether any amounts that would otherwise be payable under this Agreement have previously been paid by the Company, and may reasonably rely on any information provided by the Company with regard to such payment. A determination by the Committee with regard to a participant's entitlement to payments under the terms of this Agreement shall be binding as to all participants and the Company.
(c) In the event it shall be determined prior to a Change In Control that the participants and/or beneficiaries of the Protected Plan are subject to any tax under the terms of the Trust created hereunder, then the Trustee, upon receipt of direction from the Company, shall make payments from the Trust to such persons, in such manner and in such amounts as the Company shall direct, for purposes of (1) paying the amount of Federal, State and Local tax and interest and any penalties thereon which such participants and/or beneficiaries may incur arising out of such determination or (2) distributing the interests of participants and beneficiaries in the Trust. In the event such a determination is made after a Change In Control occurs, then each participant or beneficiary who is subject
 
to such tax, may notify the Committee, in writing, to direct the Trustee to make payments from the Trust for either of the purposes set forth in section (1) or (2) of the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall not make the payments for the purposes set forth in the first sentence of this Paragraph (c) without such written direction.
(d) Payments to participants and beneficiaries pursuant to Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Article THIRD shall be made by the Trustee to the extent that Trust funds for such purposes are sufficient to allow such payments. Subject to Paragraph (d) of Article SECOND, in any month in which the Committee directs the Trustee to make payments from the Trust and the Committee determines that a particular Account in the Trust does not have sufficient funds to provide for the payment of all amounts otherwise payable to participants and beneficiaries in such month under the Protected Plan, the amount otherwise payable to each such participant or beneficiary under such Protected Plan during such month shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of funds then available for the payment of benefits under such Protected Plan and the denominator of which is the total of the benefits payable prior to such reduction during such month to all participants and beneficiaries under such Protected Plan.
. (a) Subject to Paragraph (b) of this Article FOURTH, the Company, through its Benefit Plans Investment Committee, prior to a Change In Control, shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Trust assets, and pursuant to such authority and discretion, may direct the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, to exercise, from time to time and at any time, the power:
FOURTH:

(2) To sell, convey, redeem, exchange, grant options for the purchase or exchange of, or otherwise dispose of, any real or personal property, at public or private sale, for cash or upon credit, with or without security, without obligation on the part of any person dealing with the Trustee to see to the application of the proceeds of or to inquire into the validity, expediency or propriety of any such disposition;

(5) To join in or oppose any reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger or liquidation, or any plan therefor, or any lease, mortgage or sale of the property of any organization the securities of which are held in the Trust; to pay from the
 
Trust any assessments, charges or compensation specified in any plan of reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger or liquidation; to deposit any property with any committee or depositary; and to retain any property allotted to the Trust in any reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger or liquidation;
(6) To exercise or sell any conversion or subscription or other rights appurtenant to any stock, security or other property held in the Trust;

(9) To make loans of securities held in the Trust to registered brokers and dealers upon such terms and conditions as are permitted by applicable law and regulations, and in each instance to permit the securities so lent to be registered in the name of the borrower or a nominee of the borrower, provided that in each instance the loan is adequately secured and neither the borrower nor any affiliate of the borrower has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Trust involved in the transaction or renders investment advice with respect to those assets;
(10) To invest and reinvest any property in the Trust in any other form or type of investment not specifically mentioned in this Paragraph (a) of Article FOURTH, so long as such form or type of investment is a form or type of investment approved by the Benefit Plans Investment Committee, for the investment of assets of the Trust.
 
(b) (1) (A) Prior to a Change In Control, the Benefit Plans Investment Committee of the Company, at any time and from time to time, may direct the Trustee to segregate one or more specified portions of the Trust into a separate investment account or accounts (each hereinafter called a "Segregated Investment Account"), and may appoint and designate an Investment Director to direct the Trustee in the management of the assets of each such Segregated Investment Account (hereinafter called "that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account").
(B) Any Investment Director appointed by the Benefit Plans Investment Committee of the Company may be either an officer or employee of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, or an Investment Manager. Any Investment Manager must be either (i) an investment adviser registered as such under the Investment Advisers Act; or (ii) a bank, as defined in that Act; or (iii) an insurance company qualified to perform services in the management, acquisition or disposition of the assets of the Trust under the laws of more than one State. The Trustee until notified in writing to the contrary shall be fully protected in relying upon any written notice of the appointment of an Investment Director furnished to it by the Company. In the event of any vacancy in the office of Investment Director, the Company shall be deemed to be the Investment Director of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account until an Investment Director shall have been duly appointed to direct the Trustee in the management of the assets of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account; and in such event until an Investment Director shall have been so appointed and qualified, references herein to the Company's acting in respect of that
 
Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account pursuant to direction from the Investment Director shall be deemed to authorize the Company to direct the Trustee on the investment or the assets of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account, and subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this Paragraph (b) shall have no effect and shall be disregarded.
(2) Any Investment Director appointed pursuant to Paragraph (b) (1) of this Article FOURTH shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account, and pursuant to such authority and discretion may direct the Trustee from time to time and at any time:
(A) To invest and reinvest that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account, without distinction between principal and income, in shares of stock (whether common or preferred) or other evidences of ownership, bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unsecured or secured by mortgages on real or personal property wherever situated (including any part interest in a bond and mortgage or note and mortgage whether insured or uninsured) and other property, or part interest in property, real or personal, foreign or domestic, whether or not productive of income or consisting of wasting assets, and in order to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations, contracts, as either buyer or seller, for the future delivery of United States Treasury securities and comparable Federal Government-backed securities; provided, however, that the Trustee, upon specific directions in writing from that Investment Director, and in conformity with Exhibit D, shall invest and reinvest some or all of the assets of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account in qualifying securities issued by the
 
Company or by an affiliate of the Company, to the extent permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, unless the Trustee shall deem such directed investment or reinvestment to be inconsistent with the provisions of Paragraph (a) of Article EIGHTH and that the Trustee may retain any such securities acquired for that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account at the direction of that Investment Director until that Investment Director directs the Trustee to dispose of them; but no direction of any Investment Director to sell any securities issued by the Company or by an affiliate of the Company shall be binding if it would require the Trustee to violate any law respecting the public distribution of securities, and, in any event, without limiting the generality of the provisions of Article TENTH, the Company agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify the Trustee and hold it harmless from and against any claim or liability that may be asserted against it, otherwise than on account of the Trustee's breach of his own duties, by reason of the Trustee's investing in, or reinvesting in or selling such securities in accordance with any direction from any Investment Director or by reason of the Trustee's failure to sell any such securities in the absence of any direction from that Investment Director to sell them; and
(B) To perform acts similar to those authorized to the Trustee in subparagraphs (2) through (10) of Paragraph (a) of this Article FOURTH.
(3) In addition, each Investment Director, from time to time and at any time may delegate to the Trustee discretionary authority to invest and reinvest funds of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account in debt securities (including obligations of the Government of the United States) payable on demand or having maturities not exceeding one year or in interests in any trust fund that has been or shall be created and maintained by the Trustee or any of its affiliates as trustee for the collective short-term
 
investment of funds, the instrument creating such trust fund, together with any amendments, modifications or supplements thereof, being hereby effective when and as such investments are made, incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as fully and to all intents and purposes as if set forth herein at length.
(4) The Trustee shall exercise in respect of each Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account the powers set forth in Paragraph (b) (2) of this Article FOURTH only when and to the extent directed in writing by that Investment Director. Each Investment Director, from time to time and at any time, may issue orders for the purchase or sale of securities directly to a broker or dealer, and for such purpose the Trustee will upon request execute and deliver to that Investment Director one or more trading authorizations. Written notification of the issuance of each such order shall be given promptly to the Trustee by that Investment Director, and the execution of each such order shall be confirmed by the broker to that Investment Director and to the Trustee. Such notification shall be authority to the Trustee to receive securities purchased against payment therefor and to deliver securities sold against receipt of the proceeds therefrom, as the case may be.
(5) The Trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission of any Investment Director, and shall not be under any obligation to invest or otherwise manage the assets of the Trust which are subject to the management of any Investment Director. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be liable by reason of its taking or refraining from taking at the direction of any Investment Director any action in respect of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account, pursuant to this Paragraph (b), or pursuant to a notification of an order to purchase or sell securities by the Committee or for the account of any Investment
 
Director's Segregated Investment Account issued by that Investment Director nor shall the Trustee be liable by reason of its refraining from taking any action with respect to any Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account because of the failure of such Investment Director to give such direction or order; the Trustee shall be under no duty to question or to make inquiries as to any direction or order or failure to give direction or order by any Investment Director; and the Trustee shall be under no duty to make any review of investments acquired for any Investment Manager's Segregated Investment Account at the direction or order of that Investment Manager and shall be under no duty at any time to make any recommendation with respect to disposing of or continuing to retain any such investment.
(6) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Article TENTH, the Company agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify the Trustee and hold it harmless from and against any claim or liability that may be asserted against it, otherwise than on account of the Trustee's breach of his own duties, by reason of the Trustee's taking or refraining from taking any action in accordance with this Paragraph (b), including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any claim or liability that may be asserted against the Trustee on account of failure to receive securities purchased, or failure to deliver securities sold, pursuant to orders issued by an Investment Director directly to a broker or dealer.
(c) After a Change In Control occurs, the Committee shall have the exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Trust assets, and may appoint an Investment Director or an Investment Manager (as defined in Paragraph (b) (1) (A) of this Article FOURTH) including an affiliate of the Company or the Trustee to manage the investment of the Trust assets. Pursuant to such
 
authority and discretion, the Committee, or any investment manager appointed pursuant to this Paragraph (c), may exercise, from time to time and at any time, the power to hold or dispose of any assets held by the Trust on the date a Change In Control occurs, and shall invest and reinvest the Trust, without distinction between principal and income, in accordance with the provisions described in Paragraph (a) of this Article FOURTH
. The Trustee shall have and in its sole and absolute discretion may exercise from time to time and at any time the following administrative powers and authority with respect to the Trust:
FIFTH:
Administrative Powers

(b) To continue to hold any property of the Trust whether or not productive of income; to reserve from investment and keep unproductive of income, without liability for interest, cash temporarily awaiting investment and such cash as it deems advisable or as the Company from time to time may specify prior to a Change In Control in order to meet the administrative expenses of the Trust or anticipated distributions therefrom;

(d) To employ in the management of the Trust suitable agents, without liability for any loss occasioned by any such agents selected by the Trustee with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;

Trust or that are granted by the terms of any such Contract or by the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall have no discretion with respect to the exercise of any of the foregoing powers or to take any other action permitted by any Contract held in the Trust, but shall exercise such powers or take such action only upon the written direction of the Company and the Trustee shall have no duty to exercise any of such powers or to take any such action unless and until it shall have received such direction.

The Company shall provide such notice by using the
 
same method used by Department of Labor 29 C.F.R.  2520.104b-1(b)(1) as now in effect without regard to subsequent amendments.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 23, 2007, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2006. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on January 24, 2007, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income and related per share amounts excluding the charge that relates to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility and certain other special items. Net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding the Thann charge and other special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
99.1 Press release, dated January 23, 2007, issued by the Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Record Fourth-Quarter 2006 Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., - January 23  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported record fourth-quarter 2006 net income of $63.0 million, or $1.29 per-share, up from $32.2 million, or 67 cents per-share, for fourth-quarter 2005, due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. Fourth-quarter 2006 earnings include $5.4 million, or 11 cents per-share, of non-recurring tax benefit due principally to changes in foreign tax rates and the resulting reduction of deferred tax balances. Fourth-quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, was $34.0 million, or 71 cents per-share. The Company reported net sales in the fourth-quarter 2006 totaling $585 million compared to fourth-quarter 2005 net sales of $588 million.
Record net sales for 2006 were $2.4 billion, up $261 million, or 12 percent, from $2.1 billion for 2005. Net income for 2006, excluding the charge relating to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility, was $201.4 million, or $4.15 per-share, compared to 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $114.4 million, or $2.40 per-share. As reported, including special items, net income for 2006 was $143.0 million, or $2.94 per-share, up from $114.9 million, or $2.41 per-share, in 2005.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "We delivered a terrific fourth quarter, with strong underlying performance in each of our business segments. Our focus on technology, innovation and customer service is reflected in these results. I believe 2006 provides a solid platform for us to further grow Albemarle in a way that delivers value for our customers and our shareholders throughout 2007 and beyond."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for fourth-quarter 2006 of $229.3 million, a 15 percent increase versus fourth-quarter 2005. Net sales improved in our brominated and mineral flame retardant portfolios and in our stabilizers and curatives business due primarily to both volume and pricing improvements. Excluding a 2005 special item charge of $0.4 million, Polymer Additives segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 grew 78 percent to $38.3 million. Increased volumes and higher pricing, partially offset by increased raw materials and manufacturing costs, contributed to this increase. As reported, including 2005 special items, Polymer Additives segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 improved 81 percent.
 
Catalysts recorded net sales for fourth-quarter 2006 of $192.2 million, down 21 percent versus fourth-quarter 2005, due primarily to lower volumes in HPC refinery catalysts, partially offset by higher pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts. Excluding a 2005 special item gain of $3.2 million, Catalysts segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 increased 7 percent to $30.4 million. Higher pricing and increased polyolefin catalysts volumes, partially offset by increased raw material costs, contributed to this increase. As reported, including 2005 special items, Catalysts segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 decreased 4 percent.
Fine Chemicals recorded net sales for fourth-quarter 2006 of $163.1 million, a 13 percent increase versus fourth-quarter 2005. Excluding 2005 special item charges of $3.6 million, Fine Chemicals segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 increased 132 percent to $22.5 million. Improved pricing and increased volumes in fine chemistry services and across our bromine portfolio, combined with benefits from the disposition of our Thann, France facility and the acquisition of the South Haven cGMP facility, contributed to this increase. As reported, including 2005 special items, Fine Chemicals segment income for fourth-quarter 2006 improved 271 percent.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $10.5 million versus fourth-quarter 2005 expenses of $10.7 million. Our net debt decreased $112.1 million from September 30, 2006 and $185.8 million from December 31, 2005 due principally to strong cash flows from operations. During the fourth-quarter, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares of Albemarle stock for $17.1 million at an average price of $68.58 per share, and for the year we repurchased approximately 565,000 shares for $31.8 million at an average price of $56.30 per share.
The full year effective tax rate, adjusted for non-recurring tax benefits, was 18 percent due to a more tax-efficient geographical mix of income than expected and the benefits from foreign tax credits associated with high taxed earnings from foreign operations.
Selected data related to net income, special items and related per-share amounts for the fourth-quarters and years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in the Additional Information section below, as well as a reconciliation of net income excluding special items and net debt.

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2005 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are urged to review and consider carefully the disclosures we make in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(In Thousands of Dollars, Except Per-Share Amounts):
 
 
 
 
 
foreign tax credits related to tax structuring activities of $6,700; (2) certain tax elections made to reflect the permanent reinvestment of foreign joint venture earnings of approximately $1,400, or 3 cents per-share; (3) the repatriation of overseas funds under the Homeland Investment Act by approximately $5,600, or 12 cents per-share, consisting of a direct tax benefit in our effective income tax rate of $2,300 due to the reversal of previously accrued tax expense, as well as the effect of lower tax expense on those earnings of $3,300; and (4) the favorable net impact of two income tax adjustments totaling $2,374.
 
 
Additional Information
It should be noted that net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, for the fourth-quarters and years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Net debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure. We define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us (or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us), less cash and cash equivalents. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, as of December 31, 2005, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Investor Relations."

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.

The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.

such shareholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such shareholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C) of this section) and (B) to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the shareholder (or a designated representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.
(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the articles of incorporation.
Section 9. . An appropriate number of inspectors for any meeting of shareholders shall be appointed by the Chairman of such meeting.

Section 4. .
Meetings of Directors
(a) Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at places within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia and at times fixed by resolution of the Board or upon call of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Board, and the Secretary or officer performing the Secretary's duties shall give not less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice by letter, telegraph, telephone, in person, or other form of electronic transmission as provided by Virginia Code 13.1-686(c) as amended from time to time, of all meetings of the Directors, provided that notice need not be given of regular meetings held at times and places fixed by resolution of the Board. An annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held as soon as practicable after the adjournment of the annual meeting of shareholders.

On March 23, 2007, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company"), Albemarle Europe SPRL and Albemarle Netherlands BV, as borrowers, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries that from time to time become parties thereto (the "Company Subsidiaries"), as guarantors, entered into a $675,000,000, five-year, revolving, unsecured credit facility (the "New Credit Facility") with the several banks and other financial institutions as may from time to time become parties thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, (collectively, the "Lenders"). The New Credit Facility refinances an earlier credit facility that provided for a $300 million revolving credit facility and a $450 million term loan facility ("Prior Credit Facility") that would expire in 2009, but has now been terminated. The Company used the initial borrowings under the New Credit Facility to refinance its Prior Credit Facility and pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith.
The New Credit Facility matures March 23, 2012. Prior to each anniversary of the closing date of the New Credit Facility, the Company can request that the maturity date of the New Credit Facility be extended for an additional one-year period, but any such extension is subject to the approval of the Lenders under the New Credit Facility.
The New Credit Facility allows borrowing by the Company and by certain subsidiary borrowers located outside the United States and allows borrowings by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based on an average London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR") for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.675% to 0.320%, depending on the Company's credit rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. As of the closing of the New Credit Facility, the applicable margin over LIBOR was 0.500%. The New Credit Facility also permits the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans. In addition, each of the Company Subsidiaries guarantees to the Lenders all of the obligations of the Company and each other Company Subsidiary under the New Credit Facility, the notes and the other loan documents, including any obligations under hedging arrangements.
The New Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, including compliance with the following financial covenants: (a) consolidated leverage ratio (funded debt to EBITDA), as defined in the New Credit Facility, of not more than 3.5:1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (b) consolidated tangible domestic assets, as defined in the New Credit Facility, must be or greater than or equal to $750.0 million; and (c) with the exception of liens specified in the New Credit Facility, liens may not attach to assets where the sum of the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens and the principal amount of unsecured indebtedness of the Company's subsidiaries at any time exceeds 20% of consolidated net worth, as defined in the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, defaults for breach of representations and warranties, defaults for insolvency, defaults for non-performance of covenants, cross-defaults and guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the facility being terminated.
This description of the New Credit Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the entire New Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. You are encouraged to read the New Credit Facility. The Company and its affiliates regularly engage the Lenders to provide other banking services. All of these engagements are negotiated at arm's length.

Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) upon request of the Administrative Agent or the Company, submit to the Administrative Agent or the Company such additional duly completed and signed copies of such forms or other documentation as may then be available under then current Laws and regulations of The Netherlands or Belgium, as applicable, to avoid or reduce applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Netherlands Borrower or the Belgian Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower of any change in circumstances that would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably requested in writing by the Company or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (including filing any certificate or document or the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the applicable Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender or to reduce the amount of any such deduction or withholding to the greatest extent possible.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be required to pay any additional amount or indemnification to any Foreign Lender under (A) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this ; that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of this on the date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this shall relieve any Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports First-Quarter 2007 Results
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., - April 23  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first-quarter 2007 net income of $58.1 million, or 60 cents per-share, up from $34.4 million, or 36 cents per-share, for first-quarter 2006, due to strong performance in each of the Company's three business segments. The Company reported net sales in the first-quarter 2007 totaling $589 million compared to first-quarter 2006 net sales of $607 million.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO of Albemarle Corporation stated, "I am extremely pleased with the performance of our company this quarter. In spite of lower volumes and over $9 million of net increased raw material and energy costs compared to the previous year, our businesses delivered strong results with increased profitability in every segment. I am especially proud of our Fine Chemicals team where we achieved a step change in margin improvement. Our strengths in technology, innovation and customer service enabled us to deliver these strong results and we will continue to focus in these three areas as we strive to deliver value throughout 2007 to our customers and shareholders."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for first-quarter 2007 of $214.3 million, a 3 percent decrease versus first-quarter 2006. Net sales declined in our flame retardant portfolio due primarily to reduced volumes in our tetrabrom product line. Our flame retardant portfolio benefited from higher year over year pricing. Polymer Additives segment income for first-quarter 2007 grew 14 percent to $35.7 million due to improved pricing, offset in part by lower tetrabrom volumes and increased raw materials and other costs.
Catalysts recorded net sales for first-quarter 2007 of $235.8 million, a slight increase versus first-quarter 2006, due primarily to better pricing in all of our catalysts operations, partially offset by lower volumes in HPC refinery catalysts. Catalysts segment income for first-quarter 2007 increased 56 percent to $39.4 million due to higher pricing and increased FCC refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts volumes, partially offset by increased raw material costs. Catalysts segment income includes a $2.1 million pre-tax benefit from the elimination of an employee benefit plan.
Fine Chemicals net sales for first-quarter 2007 were $139.1 million, a 7 percent decrease versus first-quarter 2006. This decline is due primarily to the disposition of our Thann, France facility. Segment income for first-quarter
 
2007 increased 132 percent to $22.5 million. Improved pricing and increased volumes in our bromine portfolio and increased pricing in our fine chemistry services portfolio coupled with the acquisition of the South Haven cGMP facility, contributed to this increase.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $8.9 million versus first-quarter 2006 expenses of $10.6 million. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares of Albemarle stock for $18.6 million at an average price of $41.64 per share.
Our first-quarter 2007 effective income tax rate was 23 percent.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first-quarter ended March 31, 2007 will be discussed on a conference call at 8:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on April 24, 2007, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

On May 15, 2007, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company will move the operations of its cGMP (pharmaceutical-grade) pilot plant in Dayton, Ohio to its recently acquired, multi-scale cGMP manufacturing facility in South Haven, Michigan. A copy of the press release issued by the Company on May 15, 2007, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BATON ROUGE, LouisianaMay 15, 2007Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), a leading global provider of custom chemical manufacturing services, will move the operations of its cGMP (pharmaceutical-grade) pilot plant in Dayton, Ohio to its recently acquired, multi-scale cGMP manufacturing facility in South Haven, Mich., to capitalize on overlapping equipment and staffing at the two sites. The move will begin before the end of the second quarter of 2007.
"Our acquisition of a top-tier cGMP facility in South Haven and the consolidation of manufacturing and services at this site will give our customers an effective scale-up solution at a commercial manufacturing site, and strengthen our ability to deliver higher-value services," said David Clary, Albemarle Fine Chemistry Services (FCS) division vice president.
The consolidation plan includes an initial reduction in Albemarle personnel and contractor personnel at the Dayton facility by the end of the second quarter of 2007, including a transfer of some Albemarle professional personnel from Dayton to South Haven or other Albemarle sites.
Albemarle expects to retain a few staff members at Dayton at least through the end of 2008, to maintain operations required to fulfill ongoing commitments to a few key customers.
The company expects to take a pre-tax charge of approximately $4 to $5 million related to the consolidation in the second quarter of 2007.
Albemarle's FCS division provides contract R&D, custom synthesis, and custom cGMP or non-cGMP chemical manufacturing services for customers in the pharmaceutical, agricultural chemical and other markets. Capabilities include bench-, kilo lab-, pilot- and commercial-scale production. The FCS division also makes and markets bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients at South Haven and Orangeburg, S.C., cGMP facilities with extensive FDA drug master file (DMF) experience.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 24, 2007, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on July 25, 2007, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income excluding the charge that relates to the closure of the Dayton fine chemistry facility. Net income excluding the Dayton charge is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has reported net income excluding the Dayton charge because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding the Dayton charge should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding the Dayton charge, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., - July 24  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2007 net income of $53.9 million, or 55 cents per share, up from $43.3 million, or 45 cents per share, for second quarter 2006, due to strong performance in the Company's Fine Chemicals and Catalysts business segments. Excluding the $3.1 million after tax charge, or 3 cents per share, related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, second quarter 2007 net income was $57.0 million, or 59 cents per share. The Company reported net sales in the second quarter of 2007 totaling $564 million compared to second quarter 2006 net sales of $569 million.
Net income for the first half of 2007 was $112.0 million, or $1.15 per share, up from $77.7 million, or 80 cents per share, for the first half of 2006. Excluding the Dayton charge, net income for the first half of 2007 was $115.1 million, or $1.18 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2007 were $1.153 billion compared to $1.176 billion for the first half of 2006.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "I am pleased with the results and great execution from our teams this quarter. Our Catalysts business performed better than expected with segment income up 10 percent over second quarter 2006, driven mainly through margin improvement in FCC catalyst and year over year strength in the polyolefins sector. Fine Chemicals, with 230 projects in the pharma project pipeline, delivered exceptional results again this quarter. Polymer Chemicals sales increased only slightly from first quarter on a slower than expected turnaround in the consumer electronics market. All together our diversified product portfolio delivered a 32 percent increase in net income, excluding the Dayton charge, over the second quarter of last year. Our team's ability to execute on value-delivery combined with exceptional customer service put us in a position to have a very successful 2007."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for second quarter 2007 of $224.0 million, a nominal decrease versus second quarter 2006. Net sales declined in our flame retardant portfolio primarily due to reduced volumes in tetrabrom, partially offset by higher year over year pricing and increased sales of our proprietary products. Net sales increased in our stabilizers and curatives portfolio due primarily to higher volumes and pricing. Polymer Additives segment income for second quarter 2007 declined 10 percent from second quarter 2006 to $35.3 million due to lower tetrabrom volumes, partially offset by improved pricing.
Catalysts recorded net sales for second quarter 2007 of $207.4 million, a 7 percent increase versus second quarter 2006, due primarily to improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and higher pricing and volumes in polyolefin catalysts, partially offset by lower volumes in HPC refinery catalysts. Catalysts segment income for second quarter 2007 increased 10 percent versus second quarter 2006 to $32.4 million due to higher pricing, partially offset by $4.2 million lower equity earnings from our Nippon Ketjen joint venture.
Fine Chemicals net sales for second quarter 2007 were $132.4 million, a 9 percent decrease versus second quarter 2006. This decline is due primarily to the disposition of our Thann, France facility. Excluding the impact of the Thann facility divestiture, net sales increased 5 percent. Segment income for second quarter 2007 increased 55 percent versus second quarter 2006 to $21.3 million due to improved pricing across our bromine portfolio and our pharmaceuticals product pipeline. Fine Chemicals segment income includes a $4.9 million pre-tax charge related to the closure of our Dayton, Ohio fine chemistry facility.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $10.4 million versus second quarter 2006 expenses of $12.0 million. In addition, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of Albemarle stock for $29.0 million at an average price of $41.50 per share. Year to date, we repurchased approximately 1.15 million shares for $47.7 million at an average price of $41.55 per share.
Our second quarter 2007 effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 23.8 percent. Excluding the Dayton charge and the related tax benefit, the second quarter effective tax rate was 24.7 percent.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on July 25, 2007, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge, non-GAAP financial measures, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Third Quarter 2007 Results
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va.,October 22Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2007 net income of $59.1 million, or 61 cents per share, up from $2.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for third quarter 2006. Excluding the charge related to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility of $89.2 million ($58.4 million after income taxes, or 60 cents per share), third quarter 2006 net income was $60.7 million, or 62 cents per share. Strong performance in the Company's Catalysts and Fine Chemicals business segments was offset by margin declines in our Polymer Additives business segment. The Company reported net sales in the third quarter of 2007 totaling $584 million compared to third quarter 2006 net sales of $608 million.
Net income for the nine months of 2007 was $171.1 million, or $1.76 per share, up from $80.0 million, or 82 cents per share, for the nine months of 2006. Excluding the second quarter 2007 charge related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, net income for the nine months of 2007 was $174.2 million, or $1.79 per share. Net income, excluding the Thann charge, for the nine months of 2006 was $138.4 million, or $1.43 per share. Net sales for the nine months of 2007 were $1.74 billion compared to $1.78 billion for the nine months of 2006.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "The strength of our product portfolio was evident this quarter as record-setting Catalysts income helped overcome the weakness in Polymer Additives sold into consumer product markets. Fine Chemicals also delivered profit improvement year-over-year despite weak bromine demand for Polymer Additives and aggressive efforts to reduce inventory. As we enter the fourth quarter we are seeing some sequential improvement in Polymer Additives sales; however, inflation pressures and global consumer uncertainty require us to keep focused on execution to deliver another successful year."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for third quarter 2007 of $232.7 million, a 3 percent decrease versus third quarter 2006. Net sales declined in our flame retardant portfolio primarily due to reduced volumes in tetrabrom, partially offset by higher year-over-
 
year pricing and increased sales of our proprietary products. Net sales increased in our stabilizers and curatives portfolio due primarily to higher volumes and pricing. Polymer Additives segment income for third quarter 2007 declined 24 percent from third quarter 2006 to $29.4 million due primarily to lower tetrabrom sales volumes and higher costs associated with lower utilization rates, partially offset by improved product pricing and mix.
Catalysts recorded net sales for third quarter 2007 of $216.4 million, a nominal decrease versus third quarter 2006, due primarily to lower volumes in HPC refinery catalysts, partially offset by improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for third quarter 2007 increased 7 percent versus third quarter 2006 to $41.0 million, a quarterly record.
Fine Chemicals net sales for third quarter 2007 were $134.9 million, a 10 percent decrease versus third quarter 2006. This decline is due primarily to the disposition of our Thann, France facility. Excluding the impact of the Thann facility divestiture, net sales decreased 3 percent primarily due to reduced revenue from Fine Chemistry Services. Segment income for third quarter 2007 increased 26 percent versus third quarter 2006 (excluding the Thann divestiture charge) to $20.4 million due to strong performance at our South Haven facility and in intermediates and specialty bromides.
During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $9.5 million versus third quarter 2006 expenses of $10.8 million. Research and development expenses increased $3.9 million, or 34 percent, from the same period last year.
Our third quarter 2007 effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 15.4 percent, which includes a benefit from recently enacted lower tax rates in Germany. The full year reported effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5 percent.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time on October 23, 2007, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable
 
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2006 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are urged to review and consider carefully the disclosures we make in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Additional Information
It should be noted that net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. They are presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe these measures are more reflective of our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Investor Relations."

On January 28, 2008, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on January 29, 2008, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income excluding the charge that relates to the closure of the Dayton fine chemistry facility and net income excluding the charge related to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility. Net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). They are presented to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company's results. The Company has reported net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge because management believes that these financial measures are more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Neither net income excluding the Dayton charge nor net income excluding the Thann charge should be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge, non-GAAP financial measures, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Results
Full year and fourth quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va.,January 28Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2007 net income of $58.6 million, or 60 cents per share, down from $63.0 million, or 65 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2006. This decline was principally due to tax benefits recorded in 2006 for changes in foreign statutory tax rates. Operating profit increased to $77.5 million as record performance in the Company's Catalysts business segment and corporate cost reductions were partially offset by declines in the Polymer Additives and Fine Chemicals business segments. The Company reported net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 totaling $599 million compared to fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $585 million.
Net income for 2007 was $229.7 million, or $2.36 per share, up 61 percent from $143.0 million, or $1.47 per share, for 2006. Excluding the second quarter charge related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, net income for 2007 was $232.9 million, or $2.40 per share. Net income for 2006, excluding the third quarter charge related to the divestiture of the Thann, France facility, was $201.4 million, or $2.07 per share. Net sales for 2007 were $2.34 billion compared to $2.37 billion for 2006.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "We ended 2007 with solid results in a tough economic environment. Achieving record annual earnings, 16 percent above 2006 excluding the Thann and Dayton charges, demonstrates the value of our strategy to drive earnings growth and value for our shareholders. All three business segments executed well in the face of raw material inflation and soft demand in some of our consumer-related products. Our diverse portfolio, geographic balance, and commitment to operational excellence position us to achieve solid earnings growth in 2008."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Fine Chemicals net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $131.1 million, a 20 percent decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2006. This decline is due primarily to reduced revenue from clear brines volumes and the absence of TAMIFLU intermediates sales that positively impacted fourth quarter 2006 revenue. Segment income for the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased 22 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2006 to $17.7 million due to reduced volume and higher costs in Performance Chemicals partially offset by improved pricing and costs in Fine Chemistry Services. Fine Chemicals full year segment income of $86.9 million improved 40 percent over 2006.
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for fourth quarter 2007 of $233.6 million, a 2 percent increase versus the fourth quarter of 2006. Net sales increased in our stabilizers and curatives portfolio due primarily to improved pricing. Flame retardants net sales declined year over year primarily due to reduced volumes in brominated flame retardants, partially offset by improvements in mineral flame retardants sales, pricing and product mix. Polymer Additives segment income for the fourth quarter of 2007 declined 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006 to $30.3 million due primarily to lower brominated flame retardant sales volumes and higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved product pricing and mix.
Catalysts recorded net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $234.6 million, an increase of 22 percent versus fourth quarter 2006, due primarily to improved pricing in FCC and Polyolefin Catalysts and higher volumes in HPC Catalysts. Catalysts segment income for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 37 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2006 to $41.7 million, a quarterly record. The Catalysts segment had record annual sales and segment income for 2007.
Cash Flow
In 2007, our cash and cash flow from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of $99 million, stock repurchases of $101 million, dividends to shareholders of $40 million, and net repayments of long-term debt of $26 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $9.5 million versus fourth quarter 2006 expenses of $10.5 million.
Taxes
Our fourth quarter 2007 effective income tax rate was 17.1 percent, and benefited from a favorable mix of earnings from foreign operations. Our income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2006 included benefits from changes in foreign statutory tax rates. The full year 2007 effective income tax rate was 19.8 percent.
 
Outlook
The first weeks of 2008 have been solid for our business, and we have not experienced any material weakness that might be attributed to the risk in the U.S. and global economic outlooks. Our business serves many diverse end markets and we expect continued Asian and Middle East growth to compensate for slower market growth in the U.S. We are continuing to increase our presence in China with expansions underway that will help us grow flame retardants, antioxidants and fine chemicals in 2008. Absent a major global recession, we expect oil demand to remain strong and we have the catalyst production capacity on line to meet this growth in demand for 2008 and 2009. While our general business conditions are not indicating an economic slowdown, we continue to see dramatic inflation in raw materials and energy. Passing these costs through remains a challenge and area of focus for Albemarle.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on January 29, 2008, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2006 and our 2007 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Additional Information
It should be noted that net income excluding the Dayton charge and net income excluding the Thann charge are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. They are presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe these measures are more reflective of our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Investor Relations."

"Net Income" is the net income before special items each calendar year in the Measurement Period as determined by the Company for such purpose provided, however, that in accordance with the Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, Net Income may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
"Cumulative Net Income" is the Net Income for each calendar year in the Measurement Period added together.

Number of Units to be vested and paid = (QC/8) x (AP/TP) x Number of Target Units + ((8-QC)/8) x Number of Target Units
Where: QC = the number of completed calendar quarters of the performance period prior to a Change in Control.
AP = actual performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.
TP = target performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.

Shareholder Proposals
(a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.
(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only (A) pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any shareholder of the Company who was a shareholder of record of the Company who is entitled to vote at the meeting at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section.
(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of
 
such shareholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such shareholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C) of this section) and (B) to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.

(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Record Quarterly Net Sales and Operating Results
 
 
First quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va., - April 21  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2008 net income of $63.3 million, or 68 cents per share, up from $58.1 million, or 60 cents per share, for the first quarter of 2007. Excluding $2.1 million of after tax special item charges, or 2 cents per share, related to severance in conjunction with personnel reductions at the Company's Richmond headquarters and Singapore sales office, first quarter 2008 net income was $65.4 million, or 70 cents per share. Operating profit increased to $83.8 million as performance in the Company's Catalysts business segment was partially offset by declines in the Polymer Additives and Fine Chemicals business segments. The Company reported net sales in the first quarter of 2008 totaling $668 million compared to first quarter 2007 net sales of $589 million.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "I am extremely pleased with the performance of our company this quarter. Starting the year off with double-digit sales growth over first quarter 2007, we delivered record sales revenue and operating results. These results are particularly rewarding given the unprecedented raw material and energy inflation. While there is much uncertainty facing both U.S. and global economies, we believe our business strategy and our technical foundation will allow us to weather these headwinds and drive shareholder value."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives delivered record net sales for first quarter 2008 of $244.6 million, a 14 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2007. Net sales increased in our flame retardants primarily due to higher volumes partially offset by slightly lower pricing due to product mix. Net sales increased in our stabilizers and curatives portfolio due primarily to improved pricing and higher volumes. Polymer Additives segment income for the first quarter of 2008 declined 17 percent from the first quarter of 2007 to $29.8 million due primarily to higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved product volumes, pricing and mix.
Catalysts generated record net sales for the first quarter of 2008 of $276.1 million, an increase of 17 percent versus first quarter 2007, due primarily to improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts, improved product mix in HPC refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts, as well as pass through of higher materials costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Catalysts segment income for the first quarter of 2008 increased 31 percent versus the first quarter of 2007 to $51.7 million, a quarterly record, due primarily to improved product mix in polyolefin catalysts, improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Fine Chemicals net sales for the first quarter of 2008 were $147.5 million, a 6 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2007 due primarily to higher volumes from fine chemistry services. Segment income for the first quarter of 2008 decreased 4 percent versus the first quarter of 2007 to $21.5 million due to reduced volumes and higher costs in performance chemicals.
Cash Flow
In the first quarter of 2008, our cash and cash flow from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of $20 million and dividends to shareholders of $9.7 million. We utilized availability under our credit agreement for repurchases of 4.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $151 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $10.2 million versus first quarter 2007 expenses of $8.9 million.
Taxes
Our first quarter 2008 effective income tax rate was 21.8 percent, slightly less than the 23 percent rate in first quarter 2007 but higher than the 2007 full year effective rate of 19.8 percent. Our tax rate is lower than the previously estimated annual effective tax rate forecast range for 2008 of 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent principally due to the level and mix of income sources for the quarter and the year and tax planning.
Outlook
We are increasing our presence in China with expansions underway that will help us grow flame retardants, antioxidants and fine chemicals in 2008. Absent a major global recession, we expect oil demand to remain strong and we have the catalyst production capacity on line to meet this growth in demand for 2008 and 2009. While general business conditions are concerning, our business fundamentals remain sound. However, we are experiencing dramatic inflation in raw materials and energy in all of our businesses that continues to pressure operating margins. We will continue to work with our customer base to pass through these rapidly escalating costs.
 
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008 will be discussed on a conference call at 8:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on April 22, 2008, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
 
executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
 
material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.

The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of
 
meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Albemarle Reports Second Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
Second quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La., - July 21  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2008 net income of $61.7 million, or 67 cents per share, up from $53.9 million, or 55 cents per share, for the second quarter of 2007. Excluding the $3.2 million after tax charge, or 3 cents per share, related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, second quarter 2007 net income was $57.0 million, or 59 cents per share. Operating profit was $77.8 million as strong performance in the Company's Catalysts and Fine Chemicals business segments was partially offset by declines in the Polymer Additives business segment. The Company reported net sales in the second quarter of 2008 totaling $621 million compared to second quarter 2007 net sales of $564 million.
Net income for the first half of 2008 was $124.9 million, or $1.34 per share, up from $112.0 million, or $1.15 per share, for the first half of 2007. Excluding the first quarter 2008 charge related to severance in conjunction with personnel reductions at the Company's Richmond headquarters and Singapore sales office, net income for the first half of 2008 was $127.0 million, or $1.37 per share. Net income, excluding the Dayton charge, for the first half of 2007 was $115.1 million, or $1.18 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2008 were $1.29 billion compared to $1.15 billion for the first half of 2007, an increase of 12 percent.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "While we are facing very tough inflationary pressures of over $45 million this quarter our businesses have been able to respond and manage
 
margins and profitability very well. Revenue, volume and profit grew year over year demonstrating the fundamental value of our products to customers seeking to manage this tough business environment. Our business fundamentals remain strong and I believe our company is well positioned to face the challenging economic conditions we face today."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives delivered record net sales for second quarter 2008 of $260.5 million, a 16 percent increase versus the second quarter of 2007. Net sales increased in our flame retardants primarily due to higher volumes and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales increased in our stabilizers and curatives portfolio due primarily to higher volumes. Polymer Additives segment income for the second quarter of 2008 declined 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to $26.5 million due primarily to higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved brominated flame retardant product volumes, pricing and mix.
Catalysts generated net sales for the second quarter of 2008 of $208.4 million, a nominal increase versus second quarter 2007. Catalysts segment income for the second quarter of 2008 increased 33 percent versus the second quarter of 2007 to $43.0 million due primarily to improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and increased earnings from our joint ventures.
Fine Chemicals net sales for the second quarter of 2008 were $151.9 million, a 15 percent increase versus the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to higher volumes from our bromine portfolio and improved pricing across fine chemistry services. Segment income margins were 16 percent as compared to 20 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Due to high raw material and energy costs, segment income declined $1.8 million to $24.5 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007.
Cash Flow
In the first six months of 2008, our cash and cash flow from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of $40 million, acquisitions of $20 million and dividends to shareholders of $20 million. We utilized availability under our credit agreement for repurchases of 4.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $151 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $8.4 million versus second quarter 2007 expenses of $10.4 million.
Taxes
Our second quarter 2008 effective income tax rate was 18.1 percent, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.0 percent, which is comparable to our full year effective tax rate in 2007. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income due to higher than anticipated earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
We remain optimistic that each of our businesses will experience above trend top-line growth based on fundamental business prospects. Demand for our refinery catalysts should continue to increase due to
 
regulations mandating cleaner fuels and the increasing percentage of sour crudes being processed by refiners although we expect season weakness in the third quarter. Our polymer additives business has benefited so far this year from an improved supply demand equation for electronics and we have posted record sales despite prolonged weakness in the automotive and construction markets. Fine Chemicals prospects will be driven by the strength and expansion of our bromine franchise, commercialization of products in our fine chemistry services pipeline and improving utilization of our flexible asset base to deliver solutions to our customers. In addition, we remain focused on expanding our presence in emerging markets as we seek to grow our businesses in the Middle East and Asia. Our Chinese manufacturing base has grown considerably with our Jinhai antioxidants acquisition and the completion of our Nanjing phosphorus flame retardant plant. In 2008, we expect our sales in China to be roughly three times the level in 2005 and are diligently working to expand our geographic footprint. Managing the runaway inflation in raw materials, energy and other costs of doing business is taking significant effort as we work with our customers to preserve the value for our products. For the year we now expect inflation to exceed $220 million year over year with the majority of this occurring in the second half. Margin compression due to the rampant input cost inflation has been the most challenging issue facing our businesses and remains our most important area of focus for the remainder of 2008.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on July 21, 2008, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Approval of Severance Compensation Agreements
On September 30, 2008, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") approved and adopted revisions to the severance compensation program adopted by the Company in December 2006. The revisions are reflected in the severance compensation agreements (the "Severance Compensation Agreements") with respect to certain senior executive officers, which include our named executive officers, Mark C. Rohr, John M. Steitz, Richard J. Diemer, Jr. and Luther C. Kissam (the "Named Executives").
The revisions to the Severance Compensation Agreements primarily involved the following changes: (i) modified the definition of "Change in Control" to remove references to Floyd D. Gottwald, Jr., in conformance with the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") that was approved by shareholders at the Company's 2008 annual shareholders meeting; (ii) added provisions in order to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code that, among other things, require a six month delay in certain payments to participants following a termination of employment; (iii) added provisions to reflect changes in non-qualified pension plan participation for covered executives hired after 2004; and (iv) expanded from four to ten executives who will have Severance Compensation Agreements.
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Severance Compensation Agreements, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Adoption of Severance Pay Plan
On September 30, 2008, the Executive Compensation Committee also approved and adopted revisions to the Albemarle Corporation Severance Pay Plan (the "Severance Pay Plan") that was adopted by the Company in December 2006.
The revisions to the Severance Pay Plan primarily involved the following changes: (i) expands participation to include all United States-based Annual Incentive Plan participants, including those on international expatriate assignments; (ii) requires all covered participants in both the Severance Pay Plan and those who have Severance Compensation Agreements to sign non-competition agreements with the Company; (iii) provides for severance pay to each Named Executive upon termination by the Company other than for cause (which may include a Named Executive's "Resignation for Good Reason" (as that term is defined in the Severance Pay Plan)), prior to a Change in Control; and (iv) increases the severance pay level for each Named Executive to 1.5 times the amount of the Named Executive's annual base salary in effect prior to the termination of employment plus target cash bonus for the year.
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Severance Pay Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Termination Benefits
 
 
 
In addition, if the Date of Termination is other than the first day of a Variable Compensation Year, the Corporation shall pay you, as such cash Incentive Compensation for the Variable Compensation Year in which the Date of Termination occurs, the greater of your target variable compensation for the year in which the Change in Control occurs and your actual variable compensation for the Variable Compensation Year preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of days which have elapsed in the current Variable Compensation Year to the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). Payments under this clause (ii) shall be made to you not later than five (5) days after the Date of Termination.
If there is more than one Incentive Compensation Program, your accrued Incentive Compensation shall be calculated separately for each Program.
For the purpose of determining the amount of your accrued Incentive Compensation under this Paragraph 2a(ii), you will be deemed to have been paid the full amount of all prior variable and incentive compensation, whether or not such award was includible in your gross income for Federal Income tax purposes.
For the purpose of this Paragraph 2a(ii), "Incentive Compensation Program" means any of the Incentive Compensation Plans defined in Paragraph 1f and any other plan or program for the payment of incentive compensation, variable compensation, bonus, benefits or awards for which you were, or your position was, eligible to participate; "Incentive Compensation" means any compensation, variable compensation, bonus, benefit or award paid or payable under an Incentive Compensation Program; and "Variable Compensation Year" means a calendar or fiscal plan year of an Incentive Compensation Program.

(b) If you are not eligible for the retiree medical plans, you will no longer continue to participate in the Corporation's medical benefit plans, except for COBRA, and (i) if you elect to receive COBRA benefits, the Corporation shall provide you with such benefits at no cost to you for the first eighteen (18) months following your loss of medical coverage, and thereafter, (ii) the Corporation shall, for the subsequent six (6) months, purchase for you, at its cost, a policy of medical insurance providing benefits substantially similar to the benefits you would have received under the Corporation's medical benefit plans.
 
The calculation of the Short Service Benefits provided to you pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") shall be determined without regard to the benefit offsets provided for in Section 3.01(b)(i)(B) of the SERP.
[For Employees with Supplemental Pension Benefits under the EDCP:
 
 
 
(a) the greater of your annual base compensation which was payable to you by the Corporation immediately prior to the Date of Termination and your annual base compensation which was payable to you by the Corporation immediately prior to a Change in Control, whether or not such annual base compensation was includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes; plus
(b) the greater of the amount of your actual annual variable compensation payment you received for the year preceding the date on which the Change in Control occurs and your target variable compensation for the year in which the Change in Control occurs, (whether or not such award was includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes).
The Severance Payment shall be reduced by the amount paid to you under paragraph 7(c) below.
 
If the payments or benefits to which you will be entitled under this Agreement would cause you to be liable for the federal excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute payments" under Code Section 4999, then the following provisions shall apply.
If such payments or benefits exceed 2.99 times your "Base Amount" ( as defined in Code Section 280G) (the "Parachute Limit"), by the lesser of (A) 10% of the Parachute Limit, and (B) $100,000, then your Severance Payment (but not other payments or benefits under this Agreement) shall be reduced by an amount so that your payments and benefits under this Agreement are 2.99 times the Base Amount.
Whether payments to you are to be reduced, and the extent to which they are to be so reduced, will be determined by the Corporation in good faith and the Corporation will notify you in writing of its determination. Any such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis of the Corporation's determination. If you accept the Corporation's determination, you shall so advise the Corporation of your determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation. If you object to such determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation, the Corporation will retain, at its expense, a nationally recognized public accounting firm, employment consulting firm or law firm selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to you to review the matter. Such firm shall meet with you and your representatives and the Corporation and its representatives and thereafter render
 
its written opinion as to the extent, if any, that in such firm's reasonable judgment the payments and benefits otherwise due to you hereunder must be reduced hereunder. The decision of such firm concerning the extent of any required reduction in such payments and benefits shall be final and binding on both you and the Corporation.
 
(a) For purposes of this subparagraph (ix), the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
 
 
(b) Except as provided in subparagraph (viii) above, in the event it shall be determined that a Payment would be subject to an Excise Tax, then you shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an
 
amount such that after payment by you of Income Tax and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, you retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment. However, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay you no more than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) under this clause (b).
(c) All determinations required to be made under this subsection (ix), including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the public accounting or actuarial consulting firm that is retained by the Corporation as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the "Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and to you within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation (collectively, the "Determination"). In the event that the Firm is serving as accountant, auditor or consultant for the individual, entity or group affecting the Change in Control, you may appoint another nationally recognized public Firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which Firm shall then be referred to as the Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this subsection (viii), shall be paid by the Corporation to you within ten (10) days of your receipt of the Determination and in no event later than the end of your taxable year after the tax year in which you pay the Excise Tax. If the Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by you, you may request the Firm to furnish you with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on your applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. The Determination by the Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and you. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section (ix)(d) below and you thereafter are required to make payment of any Excise Tax or Income Tax, the Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for your benefit.
(d) You shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment or the Underpayment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after you are informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
 
requested to be paid. You shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which you give such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies you in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, you shall:
 
 
 
 
 
(e) If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to Section (ix)(d) above, you become entitled to receive, and receive, any refund with respect to such claim, you shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of Section (ix)(d)) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to Section (ix)(d), a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claims and the Corporation does not notify you in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall be offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
 
 
 
b. . During any period prior to the Date of Termination and during the term of this Agreement that you are unable to perform your full-time duties with the Corporation, whether as a result of your Total Disability or as a result of a physical or mental disability that is not total or is not permanent and therefore is not a Total Disability, you shall continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all other compensation and benefits that are payable or provided under the Corporation's benefit plans, including its disability plans. After the Date of Termination, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program, insurance and other applicable programs. The compensation and benefits, other than salary, payable or provided pursuant to this Paragraph 2b shall be the greater of (x) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control and (y) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect at the time the compensation and benefits are paid.
Payments While Disabled
c. . If your employment shall be terminated by the Corporation for Cause or by you other than with Good Reason for Resignation, the Corporation shall pay you your full base salary and accrued vacation pay then in effect through the Date of Termination, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given plus any benefits or awards which have been earned or become payable but which have not yet been paid to you. You shall receive any payment due under this subsection c. on your Date of Termination. Thereafter the Corporation shall have no further obligation to you under this Agreement.
Payments if Termination for Cause, or by You Except With Good Reason
d. . If your employment shall be terminated by your Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program and insurance programs then in effect except that if your death occurs after the execution of a definitive agreement which results in a Change in Control, then you shall be entitled to the benefits under this Agreement as if the Corporation issued you a Notice of Termination terminating your employment thirty (30) days after a Change in Control.
After Retirement or Death
3. .
Vesting Upon a Change in Control
a. Upon a Change in Control, all unvested stock options and restricted stock held by you under the Incentive Compensation Programs shall immediately vest and be non-forfeitable.
b. With respect to any outstanding Performance Units granted to you under the Incentive Compensation Programs which have not then vested and been paid to you, then upon a Change in Control the following provisions shall apply to such Performance Units:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. . This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2007; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2008 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless, not later than September 30 of the preceding year, the Corporation or you shall have given notice that it or you do not wish to extend this Agreement. Notwithstanding any such notice by the Corporation or you not to extend the Agreement, if a Change in Control shall have occurred prior to such termination of this Agreement, the attempted termination of this Agreement shall be deemed ineffective and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In any event, the term of this Agreement shall expire on the second (2nd) anniversary of the date of the Change in Control. This Agreement shall terminate if your employment is terminated by you or the Corporation prior to a Change in Control.

In this General Release, Employee further releases the Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities from any and all compensation owed to the Employee, including vacation pay and any attorneys' fees, damages and costs Employee could recover under any statute or common law theory, except arising under the Severance Compensation Agreement between the Employee and the Corporation and any employee benefit plan of the Corporation.

EXHIBIT 10.2
 
 
The purpose of The Albemarle Corporation Severance Pay Plan ("Plan") is to provide a period of continued income to certain employees who are terminated by certain actions of Albemarle Corporation (the "Corporation") for no fault of the employee.
 
Only those employees who are located in the United States, including those on expat assignments outside the United States, and are participants in the company's Annual Incentive Plan are eligible for inclusion under this Plan. The Chief Executive Officer of Albemarle shall nominate employees for inclusion under this Plan and the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Albemarle ("Committee") shall have the authority to designate which of those employees may participate in this Plan and such designation shall be on file with the Administrator of this Plan. Following a Change in Control, any employee designated for inclusion under this Plan may not be removed from this Plan.
Those employees who have Severance Compensation Agreements providing for certain benefits following a Change in Control shall be eligible for participation in this Plan but are eligible for benefits only under the conditions of Section III.A. below.
 
 
The "elimination of the employee's position" means that the responsibilities of the employee have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the remaining responsibilities no longer constitute a complete work assignment and any remaining duties are reassigned to a number of other positions, resulting in a net reduction of required positions.
 
For purposes of this paragraph B: (i) termination for "cause" shall mean termination of employment for willfully engaging
in conduct demonstrably and materially injurious to the Corporation, monetarily or otherwise. No act, or failure to act, shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the action or omission was in the best interest of the Corporation; and
(ii) severance payments will NOT be paid to an employee:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Prior to a Change in Control, Severance Pay for an eligible employee shall be equal to the sum of (i) one year of the employee's base pay in effect at the time of termination of employment, and (ii) the target cash bonus for the employee for the most recent year for which the employee participated in an annual bonus program.
(b) Following a Change in Control, Severance Pay for an eligible employee shall be equal to the sum of (i) the greater of the employee's base salary prior to the date of termination and the employee's base salary immediately prior to the Change in Control, and (ii) the greater of the amount of the employee's actual cash bonus for the year preceding the date on which the Change in Control occurs and the employee's target bonus for the year in which the Change in Control occurs.
Payments of Severance Pay shall be made by the Corporation in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after termination of employment.
In case of death, any unpaid allowance will be paid out in the following order: to the surviving spouse, surviving children or the estate.
 
 
 
or arrangement with the Corporation) when, in the opinion of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, such payment or benefit, when considered in conjunction with benefits under this Plan, would otherwise result in the payments or benefits to such employee constituting an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 280G(b). The amount of such reduction shall be the minimum necessary, in the opinion of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, to allow all such payments or benefits, including benefits under this program, to be properly deductible by the Corporation without restriction pursuant to Code Section 280G.
 
The provisions of the Patent and Confidentiality Agreement previously signed by a Participant in this Plan shall continue to apply following a termination of employment.
 
The Corporation expects to continue this Plan indefinitely, but reserves the right to amend or end it at any time prior to a Change in Control. After a Change in Control, no amendment or termination shall be effective with respect to any employee unless such employee consents in writing thereto.
For purposes of this Plan, the term "Change in Control" shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan, or any successor plan.
This Plan shall expire two (2) years after the date of a Change in Control.
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any claim is denied in whole or in part, the employee or beneficiary will receive written notification within 90 days, including the reasons for the denial, reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the denial was based, information about additional material needed to pursue the claim and an explanation of the claim appeal procedure. Within 90 days, the employee or beneficiary may submit a written request for reconsideration of the claim to:
The Plan Administrator will make its decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the appeal (unless special circumstances require an extension of time up to one hundred twenty (120) days and will give a written notice of its decision which specifies the reasons for its decision. The Plan Administrator will decide whether a hearing will be held on the claim and will notify the employee or beneficiary at least 14 days before the hearing, if one is to be held.
 
A participant in the Plan is entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:
 
 
 
In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of an employee benefit plan. The people who operate this Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including the Employer, or any other person, may fire an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee in any way to prevent the employee from obtaining a benefit or exercising the employee's rights under ERISA. If a claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, the employee must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. The employee has the right to have the Plan review and reconsider the employee's claim.
Under ERISA, there are steps the employee can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if the employee requests materials from the Plan and does not receive them within 30 days, the employee may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay the employee up to $110 a day until the employee receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If the employee has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the employee may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if an employee is discriminated against for asserting the employee's rights, the employee may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employee may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If the employee is successful, the court may order the person the employee has sued to pay these costs and fees. If the employee loses, the court may order the employee to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds the employee's claim is frivolous. If an employee has questions about the Plan, the employee should contact the Plan Administrator. If the employee has any questions about this statement or about the employee's rights under ERISA, the employee should contact the nearest office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

On October 27, 2008, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on October 28, 2008, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income excluding special items that relate either to severance in conjunction with personnel reductions at the Company's Richmond headquarters and Singapore sales office or the closure of the Dayton, Ohio fine chemistry facility. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). It is presented to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company's results. The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measures is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
99.1 Press release, dated October 27, 2008, issued by the Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Third Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
Third quarter highlights:
 
BATON ROUGE, La.,  October 27  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2008 net income of $56.2 million, or 61 cents per share, compared to $59.1 million, or 61 cents per share, for the third quarter of 2007. Operating profit was $76.9 million as strong performance in the Company's Fine Chemicals business segment and reductions in corporate expenses were partially offset by declines in the Catalysts and Polymer Additives business segments. The Company estimates the impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike at approximately $11 million pretax, ($0.07 per share), principally in the Catalysts and Fine Chemicals segments due to incremental costs and margin on lost revenue. The Company reported net sales in the third quarter of 2008 totaling $660.5 million compared to third quarter 2007 net sales of $584.0 million.
Net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $181.1 million, or $1.95 per share, up from $171.1 million, or $1.76 per share, for the first nine months of 2007. Excluding the first quarter 2008 charge related to severance in conjunction with personnel reductions at the Company's Richmond headquarters and Singapore sales office, net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $183.2 million, or $1.97 per share. Net income, excluding the charge related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, for the first nine months of 2007 was $174.2 million, or $1.79 per share. Net sales for the first nine months of 2008 were $1.95 billion compared to $1.74 billion for the first nine months of 2007, an increase of 12 percent.
 
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "Our operating results for the quarter were solid despite the negative operating impact from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and continued raw materials pressures. The resilience demonstrated by our employees who were personally impacted by the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes is a testament to the unparalleled energy and commitment these individuals bring to our company." Rohr added, "This performance in today's challenging economic environment provides measurable evidence of the strength of our diversified portfolio, where weakness in one market served can be offset by strength in another. All three of our operating segments saw increased sales revenues over the same period last year, with the Polymer Additives and Fine Chemicals segments achieving record quarterly sales revenues. Looking forward, we expect economic turbulence will continue to create near-term challenges for our businesses, but we believe our strong technology and operating excellence will bode well for favorable performance next year and set the stage for achieving our long-term objectives."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives delivered record net sales for the third quarter of 2008 of $261.7 million, a 12 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2007. Net sales increased in our flame retardants primarily due to higher volumes and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Polymer Additives segment income for the third quarter of 2008 declined 7 percent from the third quarter of 2007 to $27.4 million due primarily to higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved brominated flame retardant product volumes and improved phosphorus flame retardant product pricing and mix.
Catalysts generated net sales for the third quarter of 2008 of $231.6 million, a 7 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2007 due primarily to improved pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Catalysts segment income for the third quarter of 2008 declined 11 percent versus the third quarter of 2007 to $36.5 million due primarily to reduced sales and production volumes caused by the hurricanes and refineries postponing unit outages.
Fine Chemicals delivered record net sales for the third quarter of 2008 of $167.2 million, a 24 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2007 due primarily to strength in fine chemistry services and higher volumes and improved pricing from our bromine portfolio. Segment income for the third quarter of 2008 improved 21 percent versus the third quarter of 2007 to $24.7 million due primarily to higher volumes and improved pricing partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
Cash Flow
In the first nine months of 2008, our cash and cash flow from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of $63 million, acquisitions of $57 million and dividends to shareholders of $31 million. We utilized availability under our credit agreement for repurchases of 4.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $164 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $9.8 million versus third quarter 2007 expenses of $9.5 million. Primarily as a result of foreign currency exchange losses, other expenses were $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2008 versus other income of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2007.
 
At the end of the third quarter of 2008, we had $207 million in cash. Currently, approximately 70 percent of our cash is in US Treasury or equivalent securities. In addition, we have untapped lines of credit in excess of $280 million available. With strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2013, the Company has a solid liquidity position.
Taxes
Our third quarter 2008 effective income tax rate was 15.3 percent and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 18.6 percent, which is slightly less than our full year effective tax rate in 2007. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
In spite of the tremendous uncertainty in financial markets, our long-term outlook remains favorable. While downturns in refinery margins have driven a number of refineries to postpone unit outages negatively impacting short term catalyst volumes, increased sales of regenerated catalyst and a strong outlook for 2009 should support improved segment profits. We expect weak consumer spending and continued softness in the automotive and construction sectors to weigh negatively on demand for certain of our Polymer Additives products as we end this year and begin 2009. Efforts in this segment to consolidate operations and introduce new products to the market should help moderate the ongoing impact of weak markets. At the same time, we believe our Sorbent mercury removal technology coupled with continued demand for our bromine fine chemicals and custom manufacturing services positions our Fine Chemicals segment for additional growth and improved margins. Some relief from lower crude and natural gas prices is starting to be reflected in our earnings; however, full year raw material and energy costs remain significantly higher than the prior year (approximately $190 million). We are confident in our ability to weather the near-term macro-economic issues and stand well positioned to execute our long-term growth objectives with a strong balance sheet and solid cash flow generation that allow us to create value for our shareholders through organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on October 28, 2008, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: deterioration in economic and business conditions; future financial and operating performance of our major customers and industries served by us; the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section (including whether the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of
 
such shareholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such shareholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C) of this section) and (B) to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.

(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

On January 26, 2009, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes net income excluding special items that relate to the disposition of the Port de Bouc, France facility, restructuring costs at various Company locations and a net tax benefit. Net income excluding special items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). This measure is presented to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company's results. The Company has reported net income excluding special items because management believes that this financial measure is more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Net income excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net income excluding special items, the non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Results
 
 
Full year and fourth quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La.,  January 26  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2008 net income of $13.1 million, or 14 cents per share, compared to net income of $58.6 million, or 60 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter results include a $38.5 million pre-tax charge ($33.4 million or 36 cents per share after tax) related to the disposition of the Port de Bouc, France facility, a $22.5 million pre-tax charge ($14.7 million or 16 cents per share after tax) for restructuring costs, principally due to a reduction in force at various Company locations and a $32.4 million or 35 cents per share one time gain from the settlement of the 2000-2004 tax audits with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company also established tax reserves of $6.9 million due to changes in tax rules and a $2.4 million valuation allowance based upon an assessment of its ability to use certain net operating losses. Together these tax charges total $9.3 million or 10 cents per share.
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $517.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2007 net sales of $599.2 million. The global economic crisis is having the most impact on our Polymer Additives business, with a sharp decline in fourth quarter sales and operating profit in this segment. These declines were partially offset by higher sales and profits in our Fine Chemicals business.
 
Net sales for 2008 were $2.47 billion compared to $2.34 billion for 2007, an increase of 6 percent and a new annual record for the Company. Net income for 2008 was $194.2 million, or $2.10 per share, down from $229.7 million, or $2.36 per share, for 2007. Excluding the first quarter $2.1 million after tax restructuring charge and the fourth quarter $25.0 million after tax net charge detailed above, net income for 2008 was $221.3 million, or $2.39 per share. Net income for 2007, excluding the charge related to the closure of our Dayton fine chemistry facility, was $232.9 million, or $2.40 per share.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, President and CEO, stated, "The fourth quarter was a very challenging quarter. As we approached year-end, it became clear that the depth and duration of the global economic slowdown was having a greater impact than we initially anticipated."
"Against this backdrop, efforts to restructure manufacturing assets and improve transactional efficiencies were accelerated, the cost of which are captured in the fourth quarter charges. While taking immediate action to address the volume shortfall, our operating philosophy and key priorities have not changed," said Rohr. "We remain firm in our value-creation strategy, our support of research and development, and our investment in innovative technologies. We continue to pursue aggressive actions to maintain a strong financial position, preserve the profitability of challenged operations and position our business to adapt to a changing global market."
Quarterly Segment Results
Fine Chemicals delivered net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $161.3 million, a 23 percent increase versus the fourth quarter of 2007 due primarily to increased volume and pricing from fine chemistry services and improved pricing from our bromine portfolio. Fine Chemicals segment income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was flat compared to fourth quarter 2007 despite significant cost increases in raw materials and reduced volumes for bromine in the brominated flame retardant business. The Fine Chemicals segment delivered record segment income for the year.
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $148.7 million, a 36 percent decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales decreased in our flame retardants portfolio primarily due to lower volumes in brominated and mineral flame retardants caused by weakness in consumer end-markets. The Polymer Additives segment income for the fourth quarter of 2008 is $5.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 of $30.3 million. The decrease is due primarily to reduced volumes and higher raw material costs.
Catalysts generated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $207.7 million, a decrease of 11 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2007 due primarily to lower volumes in hydroprocessing catalysts (HPC) and unfavorable currency exchange rates partially offset by improved pricing. Catalysts segment income for the fourth quarter of 2008 is $31.4 million versus the fourth quarter of 2007 of $41.7 million. The decline is due primarily to reduced volumes in refinery catalysts and lower joint venture earnings. The Catalyst segment delivered record annual sales and segment income for the year.
 
Cash Flow
In 2008, cash and cash flow from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of $99.7 million, acquisitions of $64.0 million, dividends to shareholders of $42.3 million and $25.0 million in voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plans. The Company utilized availability under our credit agreement for repurchases of approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $168.9 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $9.7 million versus fourth quarter 2007 expenses of $9.5 million.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had $253.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Currently, approximately 56 percent of our cash is in U.S. Treasury or equivalent securities. In addition, the Company has available commitments under our existing lines of credit of approximately $320 million. The Company has no significant debt maturities before 2013.
Taxes
Excluding special items, the one-time net benefit of the tax settlement and the establishment of certain tax reserves and the valuation allowance in the quarter, our total year 2008 effective income tax rate was 12.4 percent. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
During our fourth quarter 2008, we settled the 2000-2004 tax audits with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The result of this settlement is a tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the full year of $32.4 million or 35 cents per share. This settlement benefited our cash flow in the quarter by $2.5 million related to tax refunds and interest. During the fourth quarter 2008, we also established a $6.9 million tax reserve and a $2.4 million valuation allowance.
Outlook
We expect the recent downturn in consumer electronics, together with already lackluster demand in the automotive and construction sectors, to impact volumes and profitability of our Polymer Additives business through 2009. Although the Company is taking steps to restructure our operations and cut costs, we expect 2009 will be challenging until consumer demand returns and global markets rebound.
The Fine Chemicals business has been relatively resilient and generated top-line growth in the fourth quarter of 2008, as the Fine Chemistry Services unit has a high percentage of its customers in the pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors, which have been less impacted to date by the current global economic conditions. The Company believes new products in Performance Chemicals and a full year of business from our Sorbent mercury removal technology should also help Fine Chemicals offset reduced volumes of bromine supplied to our flame retardant business. In 2009, we anticipate increased volumes for HPC and polyolefin catalysts, as well as a solid performance from fluid cracking catalysts (FCC). During the year we should also see increased contribution from our alternative fuels technology business.
 
The Company is targeting to achieve $30 million in annualized savings in 2009 by accelerating cost reduction programs and resizing its business footprint for the current economic conditions. We will undertake to maximize cash flow through working capital reduction and prudent capital spending, with the goal of emerging from the current economic environment a stronger company.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard time on January 27, 2009, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance.

Approval of 2009 Annual Incentive Plan
On February 16, 2009, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") approved the 2009 target percentages for the executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Company's 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain criteria to be established by the Committee are met for 2009. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (100%); John M. Steitz (70%); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. (60%); and Luther C. Kissam, IV (70%). The Committee also established the annual incentive plan metrics for 2009 bonuses based on the following factors: annual net income before special items, working capital reduction, and stewardship, including metrics related to safety and the environment. The Incentive Plan also contemplates the possibility of the payment of additional discretionary incentives to the named executive officers, but only in the event that individual's performance merits consideration of such additional incentives. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2009 will be paid in the first quarter of 2010.

First quarter highlights:
 
BATON ROUGE, La.,  April 27  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2009 earnings of $25.4 million, or 28 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2008 earnings of $63.3 million, or 67 cents per share (which included $2.1 million of after tax restructuring charges, or 2 cents per share). The Company reported net sales in the first quarter of 2009 totaling $486.6 million compared to first quarter 2008 net sales of $668.2 million, down 27 percent.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our first quarter results were significantly impacted by the continued steep downturn in consumer end-market demand and destocking actions throughout the supply chain. While nearly all markets saw some impact, our Polymer Additives sales into the consumer electronics, automotive and construction markets were the most negatively impacted. These market weaknesses also contributed to lower volumes in our bromine franchise in Fine Chemicals. In spite of the economy and the challenges of recovering high metals input costs, our Catalyst business delivered solid performance in the quarter. Overall, we operated our plants at much lower operating rates this quarter to reduce inventory levels and to better align production with current demand requirements. These prudent actions impacted profitability in the quarter, particularly in our Polymer Additives business that posted a segment loss. While we expect 2009 to be a very challenging year, our proactive response to the weakened global economic conditions should position our company to operate leaner, more efficiently and on a lower-cost basis while preserving growth opportunities."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for the first quarter of 2009 of $123.2 million, a 50 percent decrease versus the first quarter of 2008. Continued weakness in consumer electronics, automotive and construction sectors significantly pressured sales in this business. Polymer Additives segment loss for the first quarter of 2009 was $11.7 million compared to segment income in the first quarter of 2008 of $29.8 million. The decrease was due primarily to lower sales and production volumes. During the first quarter of 2009, our Polymer Additives manufacturing facilities ran at approximately 40 percent of our production capacity.
Fine Chemicals net sales for the first quarter of 2009 were $120.8 million, down 18 percent versus the first quarter of 2008. Segment income for the first quarter of 2009 was $8.7 million compared to $21.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. These declines were primarily attributable to reduced sales and production volumes in our bromine franchise. Tightly managing inventory, we held operating rates low on our bromine manufacturing assets in the quarter.
Catalysts net sales for the first quarter of 2009 were $242.6 million, a decrease of 12 percent versus the first quarter of 2008 due primarily to unfavorable metals impacts on HPC refinery catalysts revenues, currency exchange rates and lower FCC refinery catalysts volumes, partially offset by improved pricing in FCC refinery catalysts and Polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for the first quarter of 2009 was $35.7 million versus the first quarter of 2008 of $51.7 million. Our business team was able to work through a large portion of our high metals cost inventories which contributed to our 15 percent segment income margin. On a sequential basis, our HPC refinery catalysts business volumes more than doubled during the first quarter of 2009. Further, excluding the metals inventory cost impacts, first quarter 2009 Catalysts segment income would have been consistent with first quarter 2008.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other charges for first quarter 2009 included $7.8 million in adjustments associated with the reversal of certain long-term employee benefit accruals.
Cash Flow
In the first quarter of 2009, cash on hand funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $33.1 million and dividends to shareholders of $11.0 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $6.3 million versus $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to lower average interest rates year over year.
At March 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $184 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company has additional capacity to borrow in excess of $300 million under our existing lines of credit and has no significant debt maturities before 2013.
 
Taxes
Our reported first quarter 2009 effective income tax rate was 2.4 percent. Excluding non-recurring items of approximately $2.5 million resulting from adjustments related to prior periods, our effective income tax rate was 14.0 percent, down from 21.7 percent in the first quarter of 2008 and the previously estimated annual effective tax rate forecast range for 2009 of 18 to 19 percent. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
We continue to expect 2009 to be a difficult year. There is still much uncertainty as to the length of the current global economic downturn and to when meaningful demand will be restored in consumer end-markets.
We expect Catalysts' solid performance to continue as well as sequential improvement in Polymer Additives. We would anticipate our pharmaceuticals and life sciences portfolio in Fine Chemicals to remain strong and help offset reductions in bromine volumes.
As we look forward, we will see the benefits of our workforce rebalancing actions over the remainder of this year and into the future. We are on target to achieve $30 million in savings for 2009 and we are implementing additional cost management actions to stay ahead of the challenging economic conditions. We expect to emerge as a stronger and better competitor in the markets we serve and believe our actions today should shape a stronger company for the future.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.

(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

(c) General.

On July 22, 2009, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on July 23, 2009, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. The teleconference is webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items, which are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These items are presented to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company's results. The Company has reported earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items because management believes that these financial measures are more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items should not be considered as an alternative to earnings or per share amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release reconciliation information for earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items, the non-GAAP financial measures, to earnings or per share amounts, as applicable, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Albemarle Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results
 
 
Second quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La., - July 22  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2009 earnings of $38.5 million, or 42 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2008 earnings of $61.7 million, or 67 cents per share. Second quarter results included a $12.4 million pre-tax special item charge ($8.2 million or 9 cents per share after tax) related to the costs of a final contract settlement arising from the 2008 divestiture of the Port de Bouc, France facility and a $9.2 million (10 cents per share) one time benefit due mainly from a tax issue settlement for the years 2005 through 2007 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company reported net sales in the second quarter of 2009 totaling $445.3 million compared to second quarter 2008 net sales of $620.8 million.
Earnings for the first half of 2009 were $63.9 million, or 70 cents per share, compared to $124.9 million, or $1.34 per share, for the first half of 2008. Excluding the second quarter 2009 special item related to Port de Bouc and the tax benefits related to prior periods, earnings for the first half of 2009 were $60.4 million, or 66 cents per share. Excluding first quarter 2008 restructuring charges, earnings for the first half of 2008 were $127.0 million, or $1.36 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2009 were $931.9 million compared to $1.29 billion for the first half of 2008.
 
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "While the challenging economy continues to affect many of our markets, our second quarter results reflect encouraging progress overall. Cost control and some volume gains resulted in significant sequential improvements in our Polymer Additives segment profitability. Our Catalysts business also reported sequential profit improvement, driven by record performance in our polyolefin catalysts division. While our Fine Chemicals business continued to feel the effects of lower production volumes, we are encouraged by a strong new product pipeline in the second half. Through the quarter we ran our manufacturing facilities at reduced rates to better manage inventory levels, which negatively impacted our profit levels for the second consecutive quarter. However, our cost reduction programs overcame the negative absorption and contributed to our sequential performance improvement. We remain confident that our programs to control cost, generate cash, drive new products, and operate more efficiently will enable us to weather this economic downturn."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for the second quarter of 2009 of $172.7 million, a 34 percent decrease versus record net sales in the second quarter of 2008. Continued softness in consumer electronics, automotive and construction sectors contributed to these lower sales. The segment delivered strong net sales improvement on a sequential basis on slow but improved market conditions. Polymer Additives segment income for the second quarter of 2009 was $14.7 million compared to $26.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower sales and production volumes. Our Polymers segment income for second quarter 2009 increased $26.4 million compared to the first quarter of this year.
Catalysts net sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $168.6 million, a decrease of 19 percent versus the second quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to metals impacts on HPC refinery catalysts revenues, currency exchange rates and lower FCC refinery catalysts volumes, partially offset by continued pricing improvements in FCC refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for the second quarter of 2009 was $37.7 million, down 12 percent versus $43.0 million for the second quarter of 2008, but up sequentially from $35.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. Our Catalysts segment generated record overall segment income margins of 22 percent led by record profits from our polyolefin catalysts business and despite a continued impact from high metals costs in our HPC refinery catalysts business. Favorable pricing and equity income in FCC refinery catalysts and overall cost control also contributed to the quarterly profitability.
Fine Chemicals net sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $104.0 million, down 32 percent versus the second quarter of 2008. Segment income for the second quarter of 2009 was $5.2 million compared to $24.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. These declines were primarily attributable to reduced sales and production volumes as well as product mix in fine chemistry services.
We continued to operate our manufacturing facilities across all segments at reduced production rates to control inventory levels.
 
Cash Flow
In the first half of 2009, cash on hand and cash flow from operations funded net debt repayments of over $85 million, capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $60 million and dividends to shareholders of $22 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $6.1 million versus $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to lower average interest rates year over year.
At June 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $172 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company has sufficient capacity to borrow under our existing lines of credit and has no significant debt maturities before 2013.
Taxes
Our second quarter 2009 effective income tax rate, excluding the benefits related to the Port de Bouc charge and a tax issue settlement for the years 2005 through 2007, was 14.6 percent. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14 percent, down from 18.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008, but comparable to our previous annual effective tax rate forecast. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
Much uncertainty still exists as to the duration of the current global economic downturn and the impacts on the end-markets serviced by our products. However, we are seeing indications of better customer order patterns across our businesses and the benefits of our cost reduction programs. We believe that these dynamics will favorably position us to cope with the continuing challenges in the global marketplace and emerge even stronger in the markets we serve.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on July 23, 2009, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information presented in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe our expectations as reflected are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our
 
business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: deterioration in economic and business conditions; future financial and operating performance of our major customers and industries served by us; the inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy; competition from other manufacturers; changes in demand for our products; the gain or loss of significant customers; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and increased government regulation of our operations or our products. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2008 and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are urged to review and consider carefully the disclosures we make in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Additional Information
It should be noted that earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. It is presented here to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on our results. We believe this measure is more reflective of our operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
Net debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure. We define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us (or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us), less cash and cash equivalents. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, as of June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Investor Relations."

Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

On October 26, 2009, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on October 27, 2009, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009. The teleconference is webcast on the Company's website at .
www.albemarle.com
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items, which are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These items are presented to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items on the Company's results. The Company has reported earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items because management believes that these financial measures are more reflective of the Company's operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items should not be considered as an alternative to earnings or per share amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release reconciliation information for earnings or per share amounts excluding special items and one time tax items, the non-GAAP financial measures, to earnings or per share amounts, as applicable, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 also includes net debt, which is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company has presented net debt because management believes that net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and uses it as a performance measure.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Third Quarter 2009 Results
 
 
Third quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La.,  October 26  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2009 earnings of $52.1 million, or 57 cents per share, compared to third quarter 2008 earnings of $56.2 million, or 61 cents per share. The Company reported net sales in the third quarter of 2009 totaling $515.3 million compared to third quarter 2008 net sales of $660.5 million.
Earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $116.0 million, or $1.26 per share, compared to $181.1 million, or $1.95 per share, for the first nine months of 2008. Excluding the second quarter 2009 special item related to Port de Bouc ($8.2 million after tax) and tax benefits related to prior periods ($11.5 million), earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $112.7 million, or $1.23 per share. Excluding first quarter 2008 restructuring charges ($2.1 million after tax), earnings for the first nine months of 2008 were $183.2 million, or $1.97 per share. Net sales for the first nine months of 2009 were $1.45 billion compared to $1.95 billion for the first nine months of 2008.
"Volumes continue to improve for many of our products, and we are encouraged by the sequential increase in sales and profitability over the prior two quarters. Our order patterns thus far in the fourth quarter alleviate some of the concern we previously expressed about the sustainability of the recovery going forward; however, we remain cautious in this difficult environment," said Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive
 
1
Officer. "We're very proud of our strong cash generation and working capital management. We have repaid $113 million of debt in the first nine months and have $260 million of cash and equivalents at September 30, 2009. We continue to focus on cost-saving initiatives and aggressive innovation efforts to drive growth. We've demonstrated an ability to deliver high quality results in both good as well as tough times and we continue to drive value for our shareholders."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Additives recorded net sales for the third quarter of 2009 of $196.7 million, a 25 percent decrease versus record net sales in the third quarter of 2008. Softness in consumer end-markets contributed to the year-over-year decline; however, demand continues to improve sequentially. Polymer Additives segment income for the third quarter of 2009 was $26.0 million compared to $27.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. Unfavorable year-over-year volume and pricing impacts were partially offset by improvements in raw materials and other operating costs. Higher sales levels and increased utilization rates contributed to the segment's strong sequential segment income improvement of 78 percent over the second quarter of 2009.
Catalysts net sales for the third quarter of 2009 were $188.9 million, a decrease of 18 percent versus the third quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to metals impacts on HPC refinery catalysts revenues, currency exchange rates and less favorable product mix in polyolefin catalysts. Catalysts segment income for the third quarter of 2009 was $33.4 million compared to $36.5 million for the third quarter of 2008. This decline was due primarily to lower equity income, unfavorable currency exchange rates and metals impacts on HPC refinery catalysts. Segment income declined $4.3 million sequentially due primarily to polyolefin catalysts product mix and lower equity income.
Fine Chemicals net sales for the third quarter of 2009 were $129.6 million, down 22 percent from the third quarter of 2008, but up 25 percent from the second quarter 2009. Segment income for the third quarter of 2009 was $14.2 million compared to $24.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. These declines were primarily attributable to our industrial bromides business. Segment income margins improved, however, over 600 basis points from second quarter 2009 due mainly to stronger sales volumes and utilization rates in the bromine franchise.
Cash Flow
In the first nine months of 2009, cash flow from operations funded net repayments of debt of over $113 million, capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $84 million and dividends to shareholders of $33 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $6.2 million versus $9.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to lower average interest rates year over year.
At September 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $260 million in cash and equivalents. In addition, the Company has sufficient capacity to borrow under existing lines of credit and has no significant debt maturities before 2013.
 
2
Taxes
Our third quarter 2009 effective income tax rate was 9.7 percent, down from 15.3 percent in the third quarter of 2008. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be 12 percent, excluding special and one time tax items, which is approximately 2.0 percent lower than our previous annual effective tax rate forecast. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
While challenging conditions still persist in some sectors, underlying market fundamentals seem to be improving. Short term, we remain cautious and continue to focus on cash generation until we get more comfortable with the sustainability of improved market conditions. We remain confident that Albemarle is well positioned to manage through the uncertainties of the present market cycle and to capture the expected medium to long-term upside.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on October 27, 2009, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Exhibit 99.1
Albemarle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Results
 
 
Fourth quarter and full year highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La.,  January 25  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2009 earnings of $62.3 million, or 68 cents per share, compared to $13.1 million, or 14 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 results include $11.6 million in pre-tax charges ($7.6 million or 8 cents per share after tax) for restructuring and other costs related principally to planned reductions in force and to the write-off of certain assets at our Arkansas facility related to the recently announced agreement with Chemtura, which was approved on January 21, 2010 by the court presiding over Chemtura's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. Fourth quarter results also include $11.3 million, or 12 cents per share, in one-time tax benefits related principally to the settlement of the 2005-2007 tax audits with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $558.2 million compared to fourth quarter 2008 net sales of $517.7 million.
Earnings for 2009 were $178.4 million, or $1.94 per share, compared to $194.2 million, or $2.09 per share, for 2008. Excluding the second quarter 2009 after-tax special item of $8.2 million related to Port de Bouc, the fourth quarter $7.6 million after tax restructuring and other charges and $22.8 million in one-time

benefits comprised mainly from the settlement of prior year tax audits, earnings for 2009 were $171.4 million, or $1.86 per share. Excluding special and one-time tax items, earnings for 2008 were $221.3 million, or $2.39 per share. Full year net sales for 2009 were $2.01 billion compared to $2.47 billion for 2008.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO stated, "Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates tangible improvements in sales and profitability, resulting in strong earnings of $0.64 per share, excluding special and one-time tax items. All three business segments delivered solid quarterly year-over-year profit growth, improving the Company's segment income margin to 16.7%, the highest operating margin since second quarter of 2007. Our plants were able to maintain efficient and cost effective production rates throughout the quarter while we continued our efforts to better manage inventory. Three consecutive quarters of improved sales volumes, disciplined expense management and a keen focus on cash generation, enabled us to end 2009 with a strong balance sheet, including $309 million in cash and equivalents and a reduction of net debt of over $170 million for the year. Overall, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our businesses as well as the continued focused execution by our employees across the globe. I expect 2010 will be a year of strong overall revenue and profit growth for our company and believe we have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $204.6 million, a 38 percent increase versus the fourth quarter of 2008 and a 4% increase from third quarter 2009, due primarily to improved volumes in our brominated flame retardants portfolio. Polymer Solutions segment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $32.4 million, more than six times the fourth quarter of 2008 segment income of $5.2 million. The significant improvement in segment income is due primarily to increased flame retardant volumes and resultant improved fixed cost absorption.
Catalysts generated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $208 million, flat compared to fourth quarter 2008, but an increase of 10 percent versus the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to increased volumes in refinery catalysts. Catalysts segment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $41.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2008 of $31.4 million. This 33% improvement is attributable primarily to favorable product mix, input costs and royalty income in refinery catalysts. The Catalyst segment delivered strong annual sales and profits for the year, despite the difficult refining environment.
Fine Chemicals net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $145.7 million, a 10 percent decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to decreased clear brine fluids volumes. Fourth quarter volume growth in our bromine portfolio drove a 12% sequential increase in segment net sales. Fine Chemicals segment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $19.0 million, a 7% increase compared to fourth quarter 2008. Improved sales and production volumes drove a 33% increase in segment income from third quarter 2009.

Cash Flow
In 2009, cash flow from operations funded net repayments of debt of over $120 million, capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of over $100 million, dividends to shareholders of $44 million and $25 million in voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plans. The Company repurchased approximately 175,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $5.8 million during the fourth quarter. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses was $6.0 million versus fourth quarter 2008 expenses of $9.7 million.
At December 31, 2009, the Company had $309 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company has available commitments under existing lines of credit of approximately $450 million and no significant debt maturities before 2013.
Taxes
Excluding special items and the one-time net tax benefits, our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was approximately 15 percent, resulting in a full year 2009 effective income tax rate of 13 percent. The tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and mix of income and has benefited from a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
During the fourth quarter 2009, we finalized the settlement of the 2005-2007 tax audits with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The results of this settlement contributed a non-cash tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $12.1 million, or 13 cents per share, and to the $21.3 million or 23 cents per share of non-cash tax benefits for the full year.
Outlook
Despite some areas of continued economic weakness, we have seen modest but steady improvement in most of our businesses from the second quarter of 2009. As we enter 2010, we expect our overall performance to follow the gradually improving market conditions through the year. Rising raw material, energy and other costs such as pension expense may provide headwinds in 2010 that were not present in 2009. We expect operating efficiency gains, new product sales, particularly in alternative fuels and improving consumer appetite for electronics to help us overcome the headwinds and provide the basis for both top and bottom-line growth for Albemarle in 2010.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard time on January 26, 2010, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Appointment of President
On March 15, 2010, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") announced that Luther C. Kissam IV, the Executive Vice President, Manufacturing and Law of the Company, has been appointed to serve as the Company's President effective immediately. Mr. Kissam, age 45, was named Executive Vice President, Manufacturing and Law and Secretary in May 2009. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President, Manufacturing and Law, and Corporate Secretary of the Company since January 8, 2008. Mr. Kissam joined the Company in September 2003 and served as Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary from that time until December 16, 2005, when he was promoted to Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Mark C. Rohr will continue to serve as the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. A copy of the press release announcing Mr. Kissam's appointment is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
2010 Base Salaries
On March 12, 2010, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company established the following base salaries for the named executive officers that are effective as of March 16, 2010: Mark C. Rohr ($900,000); Luther C. Kissam IV ($550,000); John M. Steitz ($550,000); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. ($440,000); and John J. Nicols ($390,000).
2010 Annual Incentive Plan
On March 12, 2010, the Committee approved the 2010 annual incentive plan target percentages for the named executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain criteria to be established by the Committee are met for 2010. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (110%); Luther C. Kissam IV (70%); John M. Steitz (70%); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. (60%); and John J. Nicols (60%). The named executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide metrics. For superior corporate performance, up to two times target may be earned. In addition, based on specific individual performance goals, an additional amount may be earned up to the set maximum potential bonus. The maximum amounts payable for 2010 are as follows: Mark C. Rohr ($2,970,000); Luther C. Kissam IV ($1,155,000); John M. Steitz ($1,155,000); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. ($792,000); and John J. Nicols ($702,000). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2010, if EBITDA excluding special items exceeds 5% of Net Sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to the named executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the targets described above. The Committee bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. The Committee also established the annual incentive plan company-wide metrics for 2010 bonuses based on the following factors: EBIT (60%), cash flow from operations (30%) and stewardship (10%), which includes metrics related to safety and the environment. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2010 will be paid in the first quarter of 2011.
"EBIT" is combined income of each segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the measurement period as determined by the Company for such purpose provided, however, that in accordance with the Incentive Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
2010 Long Term Incentive Plan
On March 12, 2010, the Committee approved the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan under which it granted stock options and performance units ("PUs") to the named executive officers. The grants made to the named executive officers are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (40,000 PUs, 63,500 options); Luther C. Kissam IV (20,000 PUs, 36,000 options); John M. Steitz (20,000 PUs, 36,000 options); Richard J. Diemer, Jr. (14,000 PUs, 26,000 options); and John J. Nicols (8,400 PUs, 15,000 options). Attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein, are copies of the form of Performance Unit Agreement and the form of Stock Option Agreement used under the Incentive Plan for the grants of PUs and stock options, as the case may be.
 
Retention Restricted Stock Unit Grant
On March 12, 2010, the Committee approved a grant of 15,000 restricted stock units to John J. Nicols as part of a retention program for executive officers. The restricted stock units granted to Mr. Nicols will vest in three equal increments beginning on the third anniversary date of the award.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Record Quarterly Operating Results
 
 
First quarter 2010 highlights:
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La., - April 26  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $63.3 million, or 69 cents per share, compared to $25.4 million, or 28 cents per share, for the first quarter 2009. First quarter 2010 results include a $7.0 million pre-tax charge ($4.6 million or 5 cents per share after tax) for restructuring costs related principally to planned reductions in force at our Bergheim, Germany site. Net sales in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $580.3 million compared to first quarter 2009 net sales of $486.6 million.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "I am extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We achieved strong operating results and significantly improved year over year performance across our segments including record profitability for the Corporation and in our Catalysts and Polymer Solutions businesses. We benefited from improving trends in the markets served by our businesses and continued our keen focus on cost control and cash generation. Our disciplined efforts toward cost control, working capital and operating efficiency have positioned us well to post record results in 2010."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales for the first quarter of 2010 of $216.7 million, a 76 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to improved volumes in both our fire safety and stabilizers and curatives businesses. Polymer Solutions segment income for the first quarter of 2010 was a record $41.8 million as compared to the first quarter 2009 segment loss of $11.7 million. The significant improvement in segment income is due primarily to increased volume demand across the portfolio, particularly in brominated flame retardants, as well as higher production utilization rates.
Catalysts generated net sales for the first quarter of 2010 of $227.7 million, a decrease of 6 percent versus first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the impact of lower metals pricing, which we pass through, partly offset by favorable product pricing and mix. Catalysts segment income for the first quarter of 2010 was a record $55.1 million versus the first quarter of 2009 of $35.7 million. This 54 percent improvement was attributable primarily to improved realization of metals costs in refinery catalysts, favorable sales mix including profit contribution from our alternative fuels business and higher equity income.
Fine Chemicals net sales in the first quarter of 2010 were $136 million, a 13 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2009, due primarily to increased volumes in our performance chemicals business offset by lower volumes in fine chemistry services. Fine Chemicals segment income for the first quarter of 2010 was $11.8 million versus $8.7 million in first quarter 2009. Improved sales and production volumes drove a 35 percent increase in segment income from first quarter 2009.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other charges were $16.7 million for first quarter 2010. These charges were up year over year due mainly to higher personnel related costs. First quarter 2009 included $7.8 million in favorable adjustments associated with the reversal of certain long-term employee benefit accruals.
Cash Flow
In the first quarter of 2010, cash on hand funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $16.1 million and dividends to shareholders of $11.4 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses of $5.9 million were comparable to first quarter of 2009 expenses of $6.3 million. This slight decrease was due primarily to lower average debt balances year over year.
At March 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $267 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company has additional capacity to borrow in excess of $460 million under our existing lines of credit and has no significant debt maturities before 2013. Focus on inventory levels resulted in lower balances at March 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009 despite the increase in business activity.
 
Taxes
Our reported first quarter 2010 effective income tax rate was 23.4 percent. Excluding the 2010 special item and $2.5 million in nonrecurring tax adjustments in 2009 relating to prior periods, the effective tax rate was 24.4 percent versus 14 percent for first quarter 2009. The increase is due mainly to level and mix of income in higher tax jurisdictions, principally significantly higher income in the U.S.
Outlook
The volume improvement in most of our segments again this quarter is an encouraging sign that conditions in our key markets have improved. As a result of the initiatives we undertook in 2009, we are better positioned to capitalize on opportunities in these markets if demand remains strong. We will continue to monitor key economic indicators and do our best to manage potential headwinds such as increased raw material and energy costs. We remain optimistic that 2010 will result in outstanding full year performance.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on April 27, 2010, which can be accessed through Albemarle's website under Investor Information at .

Albemarle Reports Record Quarterly Operating Results
 
 
Second quarter 2010 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, La., - July 26, 2010  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2010 earnings of $81.8 million, or 89 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2009 earnings of $38.5 million, or 42 cents per share. Second quarter 2009 results included a $12.4 million pre-tax charge ($8.2 million or 9 cents per share after tax) related to the costs of a final contract settlement arising from the 2008 divestiture of the Port de Bouc, France facility and a $9.2 million (10 cents per share) benefit related mainly to a tax issue settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 2005 through 2007. The Company reported net sales in the second quarter of 2010 totaling $592.5 million compared to second quarter 2009 net sales of $445.3 million.
Earnings for the first half of 2010 were $145.1 million, or $1.57 per share, compared to $63.9 million, or 70 cents per share, for the first half of 2009. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs at our Bergheim, Germany site in first quarter 2010, and first half 2009 special and one-time tax items, earnings for the first half 2010 were $149.7 million, or $1.62 per share, and earnings for the first half 2009 were $60.4 million, or 66 cents per share. Net sales for the first half of 2010 were $1.17 billion compared to $932 million for the first half of 2009.
 
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved record earnings, expanded our margins across all three segments and generated strong cash flow. The strength of our portfolio, our innovative technologies and the structural improvements we are implementing are flowing through to the bottom line. These capabilities and actions, coupled with the positive trends we are seeing in the global markets we serve, contributed to a very solid second quarter."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales for the second quarter of 2010 of $235.3 million, a 36 percent increase versus net sales in the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to improved volumes in our fire safety businesses. Polymer Solutions segment income for the second quarter of 2010 more than tripled to $47.0 million from $14.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. This increase was due primarily to the strong volume improvements across the fire safety portfolio, particularly in brominated flame retardants, as well as higher production utilization rates.
Catalysts generated net sales for the second quarter of 2010 of $216.0 million, an increase of 28 percent versus the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to higher volumes and favorable product mix mainly in our hydroprocessing refinery catalysts business, as well as volumes in our polyolefins business. Catalysts segment income for the second quarter of 2010 was $66.2 million, up 76 percent versus $37.7 million for the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was attributable primarily to higher volumes and improved realization of metals costs in hydroprocessing refinery catalysts, favorable product mix and higher equity income.
Fine Chemistry net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $141.2 million, up 36 percent versus the second quarter of 2009, due primarily to increased volumes in both our performance chemicals and fine chemistry services businesses, and partly offset by product mix. Segment income for the second quarter of 2010 was $17.5 million compared to $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2009. Improved sales and production volumes, particularly in performance chemicals, drove the more than three-fold increase in segment income.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 was $18.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively. These charges were up over the comparable periods of 2009 due mainly to higher personnel related costs. Also, the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 included $7.8 million in favorable adjustments associated with the reversal of certain long-term employee benefit accruals.
 
Cash Flow
In the first half of 2010, cash on hand funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $33.9 million and dividends to shareholders of $24.1 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $6.0 million versus $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2009.
At June 30, 2010, the Company had approximately $324.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company has additional capacity to borrow in excess of $460 million under existing lines of credit and has no significant debt maturities before 2013. Our continued focus on inventory levels resulted in lower balances at June 30, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009 despite the increase in business activity.
Taxes
Our second quarter 2010 effective income tax rate was 24.4 percent versus 14.6 percent in 2009 (excluding the effects of the Port de Bouc charge and the one-time tax items). The full year 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be 24.4 percent. This increase versus 2009 is due mainly to level and mix of income, principally significantly higher net income in the U.S. in the current year.
Outlook
Our outlook for the year remains positive. As we continue to monitor global economic indicators, industry trends and customer order patterns, we believe most signs indicate a strong third quarter with a typical seasonal contraction in the fourth quarter. We believe effective implementation of announced price increases, continued focus on cost and innovative product development should help sustain solid performance and healthy financial returns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2011.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on July 27, 2010. The call can be accessed by dialing 866-804-6924 (International Dial In # 857-350-1670), and entering conference ID 76650993.

Albemarle Achieves Record Quarterly Earnings
 
 
Third quarter 2010 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - October 21, 2010  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2010 earnings of $93.7 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter 2009 earnings of $52.1 million, or 57 cents per share. The Company reported net sales of $585 million in the third quarter 2010 compared to net sales of $515 million in the third quarter 2009.
Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $238.7 million, or $2.59 per share, compared to $116.0 million, or $1.26 per share, for the same period in 2009. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs at our Bergheim, Germany site in the first quarter 2010, and the special and one-time tax items reported for the nine months 2009, earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $243.3 million, or $2.64 per share, and earnings for the same period in 2009 were $112.7 million, or $1.23 per share. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $1.76 billion compared to $1.45 billion for the same period in 2009.
 
 
Commenting on the Company's results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated "We reached several new milestones in the third quarter 2010, including generating the highest quarterly earnings and EBITDA in the Company's history as well as outstanding cash generation. All three segments posted strong year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits. Demand continued to show strength through the quarter, contributing to an already tight supply situation for many of our products. While we expect some seasonal weakness for the fourth quarter, our business fundamentals remain solid and I believe we will finish the year with good momentum carrying us into 2011."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales for the third quarter 2010 of $231.8 million, an 18 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter 2009, due primarily to improved volumes and pricing in our fire safety businesses, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Polymer Solutions segment income for the third quarter 2010 was $58.5 million, a 125 percent increase from $26.0 million in the third quarter 2009. This increase was due primarily to strong volume and pricing improvements across the fire safety portfolio, particularly in brominated flame retardants, as well as higher production utilization rates.
Catalysts generated net sales for the third quarter 2010 of $214.8 million, a 14 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter 2009, due primarily to higher volumes and favorable mix in our refinery catalysts business, as well as higher volumes in our polyolefins business. Catalysts segment income for the third quarter 2010 was $68.9 million, a 106 percent increase from $33.4 million in the third quarter 2009. This improvement over the prior year quarter was attributable primarily to the overall favorable volume and mix impact for the segment, improved realization of metals costs in hydroprocessing refinery catalysts and favorable production utilization rates.
Fine Chemistry net sales for the third quarter 2010 were $138.4 million, a 7 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter 2009, due primarily to higher volumes and improved pricing, particularly in our performance chemicals businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Fine Chemistry segment income for the third quarter 2010 was $16.5 million compared to $14.2 million in the third quarter 2009. Improved sales volumes and price as well as production utilization in performance chemicals drove the 16 percent increase in segment income.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 was $17.5 million and $52.2 million, respectively. The increase over the comparable periods in 2009 was due mainly to higher personnel-related costs. In addition, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 included a favorable $7.8 million adjustment associated with the reversal of certain long-term employee benefit accruals.
 
 
Cash Flow
In the nine months ended September 30, 2010, cash on hand funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $50.0 million and dividends to shareholders of $36.9 million. During the quarter, interest and financing expenses were $6.1 million, essentially flat compared to third quarter 2009 expenses of $6.2 million.
At September 30, 2010, the Company had approximately $424.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has additional capacity to borrow in excess of $514 million under existing lines of credit with no significant debt maturities before 2013.
Taxes
Our third quarter 2010 effective income tax rate was 24.1 percent versus 9.7 percent in the third quarter 2009. Excluding special and one-time tax items, the full year 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be 24.3 percent as compared to 13 percent for the year 2009. This increase, compared to 2009, continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income, with significantly higher income in the U.S.
Outlook
We remain optimistic toward achieving outstanding results for the year. Industry trends and customer order patterns support this view and we believe effective implementation of announced price increases, continued focus on cost and innovative product development will continue to drive strong operating performance as we close out the year and enter into 2011.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on October 22, 2010.

On December 6, 2010, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") announced that the Company has entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Petrobras Qumica S.A. (the Company's current joint venture partner in Fbrica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A.) relating to the Company's proposed plan to build a new facility for the production of hydroprocessing catalysts.
A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
 
99.1    Press release date December 6, 2010
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
(Baton Rouge, LA) December 06, 2010 - (NYSE: ALB) and announced today that they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to build a world scale hydroprocessing catalyst (HPC) production plant on the site of their existing joint venture Fabrica Carioca de Catalisadores SA (FCC SA) in Santa Cruz, Brazil. The new facility will complement existing production of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts.
Albemarle Corporation
Petrobras
The plant will be constructed ahead of significant demand growth for hydroprocessing catalysts, as Brazil begins to implement more stringent specifications for ultra low sulfur diesel and as Petrobras begins to introduce new hydrotreaters to existing and new refineries over the coming years. Albemarle will provide FCC SA with its leading technology for the manufacture of HPC, enabling the production of STARS catalysts, which have enabled the broad implementation of the most stringent sulfur specifications in fuels in North America, Western Europe and Japan. The plant will be ideally placed to serve growing needs for HPC in South America.
Petrobras and Albemarle are also further enhancing their partnership by engaging into a joint technical cooperation aimed at the further development of advanced hydroprocessing catalysts, mirroring their very successful existing cooperation in the area of FCC catalysts.
Paulo Roberto Costa, Downstream Director of Petrobras said, "Petrobras is investing hard to improve the quality of its oil derived streams with the construction of new hydrotreating and hydroconversion units. Petrobras is increasingly making use of hydroprocessing catalysts and its future needs are going up by significant investments in new refining units. As an illustration of our catalysts demand, in 2016 it is expected to be 5 times higher than current consumption. This development is particularly important to guarantee market competitive sourcing over the long term. It also reinforces our strategic alliance with Albemarle."
Mark Rohr, Chairman and CEO of Albemarle Corporation said, "The partnership between Petrobras and Albemarle in refinery catalysts has been truly unique and has generated significant value for both companies for over 25 years. This expansion into HPC takes our relationship with Petrobras to the next level and also allows us to combine the technological leadership of both companies to best provide South America with clean fuels meeting the highest standards."

On December 7, 2010, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company, J.P.Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters listed in Schedule 1 thereto (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Notes due December 15, 2020 (the "Notes") to the Underwriters at a price equal to 98.451 % of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. The Notes were offered at a public offering price of 99.101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, resulting in an underwriting discount of 0.65%. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties.
The estimated net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes is approximately $343.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will use the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility and to fund pension related obligations. Certain affiliates of the underwriters are lenders under the revolving credit facility.
The terms of the Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor to The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and modified by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 10, 2010, (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15th and December 15th of each year, commencing on June 15, 2011. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, on terms and at redemption prices as described in the Indenture. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
The Indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for (i) a failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable, (ii) a failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of any such default upon notice, (iii) a default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant that is not cured within 60 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the trustee or holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, (iv) a default by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced indebtedness in an aggregate amount greater than $40.0 million which default is caused by a failure to pay principal, interest or premium within any applicable grace period, or results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, and (v) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. The Indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and lease back transactions.
The offering of the Notes was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2010 (File No. 333-171014, the "Registration Statement").

(ee) No relationship, direct or indirect, exists between or among any of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, on the one hand, and any director, officer, stockholder, customer or supplier of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, on the other hand, which is required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which is not so described and described as required.

property and buildings by the Company and the Material Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of any claim adverse to its ownership of any real or personal property or of any claim against the continued possession of any real property, whether owned or held under lease or sublease by the Company or any Subsidiary which would (individually or in the aggregate) result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(hh) The Company and each Subsidiary (i) own or possess adequate right to use all patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights, licenses, formulae, customer lists, and know-how and other intellectual property (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures, "Intellectual Property") necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as being conducted and as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and Prospectus, except where the failure to own or possess such rights, either singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) have no reason to believe that the conduct of their respective businesses does or will conflict with, and have not received any notice of any claim of conflict with, any such right of others, except for any such conflicts, either singly or in the aggregate, that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. Commercially reasonable steps have been taken by the Company to maintain the confidential nature of all material technical information developed by and belonging to the Company or any Subsidiary which has not been patented. To the Company's knowledge, there is no infringement by third parties of any such Intellectual Property; there is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the Company's or any Subsidiary's rights in or to any such Intellectual Property, and the Company is unaware of any facts which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim; and there is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others that the Company or any Subsidiary infringes or otherwise violates any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights of others, and the Company is unaware of any other fact which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim, except for such actions, suits, proceedings or claims that would not (either individually or in the aggregate) result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(ii) The Company maintains insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as the Company reasonably considers adequate for the conduct by the Company and the Subsidiaries of their respective businesses and the value of their respective properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries, all of which insurance is in full force and effect, except where the failure to maintain such insurance would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no material claims by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability, has indicated that it intends to deny liability or is defending under a reservation of rights clause. The Company has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance as and when such coverage expires or will not be able to obtain replacement insurance adequate for the conduct of its business and the value of its properties at a cost that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(jj) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has accurately prepared and timely filed all material federal, state, foreign and other tax returns that are required to be filed by it and has paid or made provision for the payment of all material taxes, assessments, governmental or other similar charges, including without limitation, all sales and use taxes and all taxes which the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to employees, creditors and third parties, with respect to the periods covered by such tax returns (whether or not such amounts are shown as due on any tax return), except, in all cases, for any such taxes, assessments, governmental or other similar charges, that are being contested in good faith. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received a notice of deficiency as described in Section 6212 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code," which term, as used herein, includes the regulations and published interpretations thereunder), or notice of similar consequence with respect to a proposed adjustment of the Company's or any Subsidiary's federal, state, local or foreign taxes, and to the Company's knowledge, no such notice is threatened to be delivered. The accruals and reserves on the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of tax liabilities for any taxable period not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments and related liabilities for any such period and, since December 31, 2008, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred any material liability for taxes other than in the ordinary course of their businesses. There is no tax lien, whether imposed by any federal, state, foreign or other taxing authority, outstanding against the assets, properties or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, except such tax liens that (either individually or in the aggregate) would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(kk) No labor disturbance by the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary exists or, to the Company's knowledge, is imminent and the Company is not aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbances by the employees of any of its or any Subsidiary's principal suppliers, manufacturers, customers or contractors, which, in either case (individually or in the aggregate), could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(ll) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries and any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the regulations promulgated and interpretations published thereunder, ("ERISA")) established or maintained by the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) are, in each case, in compliance in all material respects with ERISA. "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any member of any group of organizations described in Section 414 of the Code of which the Company or such subsidiary, as applicable, is a member. No "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) or "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur with respect to any "employee benefit plan" established or maintained by any of the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates with respect to which any of the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates would reasonably be expected to have any material liability. With respect to any employee benefit plan established or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, there has been no, and it is not reasonably likely that there will be any, (i) failure to satisfy the applicable minimum
 
funding standards set forth in Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, or (ii) determination that any such employee benefit plan is or is expected to be in "at-risk" status, within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA. None of the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expect to incur any material liability under (i) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal (including partial withdrawal) from, any "employee benefit plan" or (ii) Sections 412, 4971, 4975 or 4980B of the Code. Each "employee benefit plan" established or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, in each case, that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates participates in, or otherwise could reasonably be expected to incur any liability with respect to, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA).
(mm) Except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, (i) there is not any and there has been no storage, generation, transportation, handling, treatment, disposal, discharge, emission or other release of any kind of, or exposure to, any Hazardous Substances (as defined below) by, due to, caused by or involving the Company or any Subsidiary, or their respective operations or products, or any other entity for whose acts or omissions the Company is or may be liable, upon or at any property now or previously owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary, or upon any other property, and to the Company's knowledge (ii) Hazardous Substances are not otherwise present at any property now or previously owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary, or any other property, that in either case (i) or (ii) would be a material violation of or give rise to any material liability under any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or permit relating to pollution or protection of human health, natural resources, threatened or endangered species or the environment ("Environmental Law").

The disclosure in the Time of Sale Information with respect to Environmental Laws, including with respect to any proceedings that are pending, or that are known to be contemplated, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder and any capital or other expenditures relating to compliance therewith complies, and there is no omission of fact from the Time of Sale Information relating to such laws, proceedings or
 
expenditures necessary to comply, in all material respects with the Securities Act.

7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7(b) hereof.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the
Indemnification of the Company.
 
Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and, under the heading "Underwriting," (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to discounts and commissions and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus or the final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section 7(a) or (b) except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under Section 7(a) or (b). If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same
Notice and Procedures.
provided
provided
further
 
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. .

Termination
10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons

satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the
Payment of Expenses
 
Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing this Agreement, the Securities, the Indenture and the supplemental indenture to be entered into in connection with the issuance of the Securities (the "Supplemental Indenture") (collectively, the "Transaction Documents"); (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, FINRA; (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (x) any expenses and application fees related to the listing of the Securities on an any stock exchange.
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

Exhibit 4.2
SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of December 10, 2010 (this "Second Supplemental Indenture"), between Albemarle Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), whose principal office is located at 451 Florida Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70801 and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as successor to The Bank of New York (the "Original Trustee"), as trustee (the "Trustee").
WHEREAS, the Company and the Original Trustee have duly executed and delivered an Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005 (the "Indenture"), providing for the authentication, issuance, delivery and administration of unsecured notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness to be issued in one or more series by the Company (herein called a "Security" or the "Securities"); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company desires to provide for the establishment of a series of Securities (the "Notes") to be issued under the Indenture in an initial aggregate principal amount of $350,000,000, which may be authenticated and delivered as provided in the Indenture; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend and supplement the provisions of the Indenture to issue the Notes under the terms of the Indenture as supplemented hereby; and
WHEREAS, Section 9.01 of the Indenture expressly permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for the purposes, inter alia, of establishing the forms and terms of Securities to be issued under the Indenture, and permits the execution of such supplemental indentures without the consent of the Holders of any Securities then outstanding; and
WHEREAS, for the purposes recited above, and pursuant to due corporate action, the Company has duly determined to execute and deliver to the Trustee this Second Supplemental Indenture; and
WHEREAS, all conditions and requirements necessary to make this Second Supplemental Indenture a valid instrument in accordance with its terms have been done and performed, and the execution and delivery hereof have been in all respects duly authorized.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the Company and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree as follows:
SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.
1.1 All terms contained in this Second Supplemental Indenture shall, except as specifically provided herein or except as the context may otherwise require, have the meanings given to such terms in the Indenture.
1.2 Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Depositary" means The Depository Trust Company or any other depositary from time to time specified with respect to the Notes pursuant to the Indenture.
"Global Note Legend" means the legend for the Global Securities substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.04 of the Indenture.
"Global Notes" mean Notes constituting Global Securities substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.
"Notes" shall have the meaning given such term in the second recital of this Second Supplemental Indenture.
SECTION 2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SECURITIES.
There is hereby authorized the following series of Notes:
2.1 .
4.50% Senior Notes due 2020
(a) A new series of senior unsecured Notes is hereby authorized and designated as the "4.50% Senior Notes due 2020".
(b) The 4.50% Senior Notes due 2020 shall be issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $350,000,000, subject to adjustment as described in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Notes shall bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, shall mature on December 15, 2020 and shall be subject to optional redemption at any time by the Company pursuant to the terms set forth in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A.
(c) The Company shall be permitted to amend this Second Supplemental Indenture in order to increase the aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued hereunder without the consent of the Holders of the Notes or the Securities of any series so affected. Any such additional Notes will have the same terms as the Notes and will rank equal to the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the additional Notes or except in certain circumstances for the first payment of interest following the issue) so that the additional Notes may be consolidated and form a single series of Securities with the Notes and have the same terms as to status, redemption and otherwise as the Notes that are the subject of this Second Supplemental Indenture.
2.2 . The Notes shall initially be issued in the form of Global Notes (including the Global Note Legend thereon and the "Schedule of Increases and Decreases in the Global Note" attached thereto). Each Global Note shall represent such of the outstanding Notes as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect any redemptions and be increased to reflect the issuance of any additional Notes. Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect the amount of any decrease or increase in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee, as custodian of the Global Notes.
Form of Global Notes
 
2.3 . The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as initial Paying Agent and Security Registrar for the Notes and the Trustee hereby accepts such appointments.

2.5 . Under and pursuant to the Notes, the Company has been granted the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a Redemption Price specified in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A.

In that regard, the Independent Investment Banker shall, as a condition to its appointment by the Company, agree to furnish to the Company on or before the second Business Day preceding the Redemption Date the Comparable Treasury Price.
Procedures Regarding Optional Redemption
2.6 .
Procedures Regarding Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Events
(a) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right under and pursuant to the Notes to redeem all of the Notes, each Holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer (as defined below). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Holder's Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due and owing on the relevant interest payment date. Unless the Company has exercised its right under and pursuant to the Notes to redeem all of the Notes, within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Company shall send a notice (the "Change of Control Offer Notice") to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on a date no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law (such date, the "Change of Control Payment Date" and such offer to repurchase, the "Change of Control Offer"). The Change of Control Offer Notice shall be sent
 
by first class mail and in accordance with the other procedures specified in Section 1.07 of the Indenture and shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control Offer Notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of the Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture relating to such Change of Control Offer, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations in this Section 2.6(a) by virtue of any such conflict.
(b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
(c) The Change of Control Offer Notice shall state that Holders electing to have a Note purchased shall be required to surrender the Note, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the purchase date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the purchase date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Note purchased.
(d) The Change of Control Offer Notice shall state that the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to each Holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided, however, that each such new Note shall be in a principal amount of $2,000 or any greater amount in multiples of $1,000.
(e) Notwithstanding this Section 2.6, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
(f) Notwithstanding this Section 2.6, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment on the Change of Control Payment Date.
(g) For purposes of this Second Supplemental Indenture, the following definitions are applicable:
(1 ) "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following after the date of issuance of the Notes:
(A) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" or "group" (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries;
(B) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" or "group" (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of the Company's Voting Stock representing a majority of the voting power of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock;

(2) "Change of Control Triggering Event" means, with respect to the Notes, (i) the rating of such Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies on any date during the period (the "Trigger Period") commencing on the occurrence of a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control (which Trigger Period will be extended following consummation of a Change of Control for so long as any of the Rating Agencies has publicly announced that it is considering a possible ratings change), and (ii) such Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any day during the Trigger Period; provided that a Change of Control Trigger Event will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control if each Rating Agency making the reduction in rating does not publicly announce or confirm or inform the trustee at our or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the Change of Control.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Change of Control Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred in connection with any particular Change of Control unless and until such Change of Control has actually been consummated.
(3) "Continuing Director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who:
(A) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes; or
(B) was nominated for election or elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (or such lesser number comprising a majority of a nominating committee if authority for such nomination, election or appointment has been delegated to a nominating committee whose authority and composition have been approved by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time such committee was formed) either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination or otherwise.
(4) "Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's) and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P), and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company under the circumstances permitting the Company to select a replacement rating agency and in the manner for selecting a replacement rating agency, in each case as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agency."

(7) "Rating Agency" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, that if either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide rating services to issuers or investors, the Company may appoint another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act as a replacement for such Rating Agency; provided that the Company shall give notice of such appointment to the Trustee.
(8) "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for (except for Defaulted Interest), on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the June 1 or December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date even if Notes are cancelled, repurchased or redeemed after the Regular Record Date and on or before the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

Dated:
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated:
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2010 (herein, together with any additional supplements or amendments, called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates or the date of Maturity (or any earlier redemption or repayment date), as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the case where the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) does not fall on a Business Day, payment of interest, premium, if any, or principal otherwise payable on such date need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date), and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) to such next succeeding Business Day.
This Note and all the obligations of the Company hereunder are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank without preference or priority among themselves and pari passu with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company, subject to certain statutory exceptions in the event of liquidation upon insolvency.
The Notes are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) from the Redemption Date through the date of Maturity, in each case discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time on or after September 15, 2020, the Notes will be redeemable as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed up to but not including the Redemption Date. A redemption of the Notes pursuant to this paragraph is referred to as a "Three-Month Par Call."
For purposes of the second immediately preceding paragraph, the following defined terms shall have the meanings specified:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealers in the United States and such dealer's affiliates.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and UBS Securities LLC or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers, and their respective successors and (2) two other Primary Treasury Dealers to be appointed by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing Primary Treasury Dealers or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis, by lot, or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state, among other things, the amount of the Notes to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the manner in which the Redemption Price will be calculated and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Notes to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Company will pay interest to a person other than the Holder of record on the Regular Record Date if the Company elects to redeem the Notes on a date that is after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In this instance, the Company will pay accrued interest on the Notes being redeemed to, but not including, the Redemption Date to the same Person to whom the Company will pay the principal of those Notes.
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, any Holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase as provided in the Second Supplemental Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the indebtedness represented by the Notes or certain restrictive covenants (and related Events of Default) with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains specified Events of Default which will apply with respect to the Notes. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect prescribed in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification or waiver of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes and each other series of Securities to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and other Securities at the time Outstanding to be affected.

Dated:    December 10, 2010
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated:    December 10, 2010
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2010 (herein, together with any additional supplements or amendments, called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates or the date of Maturity (or any earlier redemption or repayment date), as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the case where the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) does not fall on a Business Day, payment of interest, premium, if any, or principal otherwise payable on such date need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date), and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity (or any redemption or repayment date) to such next succeeding Business Day.
This Note and all the obligations of the Company hereunder are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank without preference or priority among themselves and pari passu with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company, subject to certain statutory exceptions in the event of liquidation upon insolvency.
The Notes are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) from the Redemption Date through the date of Maturity, in each case discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time on or after September 15, 2020, the Notes will be redeemable as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed up to but not including the Redemption Date. A redemption of the Notes pursuant to this paragraph is referred to as a "Three-Month Par Call."
For purposes of the second immediately preceding paragraph, the following defined terms shall have the meanings specified:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealers in the United States and such dealer's affiliates.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and UBS Securities LLC or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers, and their respective successors and (2) two other Primary Treasury Dealers to be appointed by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing Primary Treasury Dealers or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis, by lot, or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state, among other things, the amount of the Notes to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the manner in which the Redemption Price will be calculated and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Notes to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
The Company will pay interest to a person other than the Holder of record on the Regular Record Date if the Company elects to redeem the Notes on a date that is after a Regular Record Date but
on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In this instance, the Company will pay accrued interest on the Notes being redeemed to, but not including, the Redemption Date to the same Person to whom the Company will pay the principal of those Notes.
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, any Holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase as provided in the Second Supplemental Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the indebtedness represented by the Notes or certain restrictive covenants (and related Events of Default) with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains specified Events of Default which will apply with respect to the Notes. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect prescribed in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification or waiver of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes and each other series of Securities to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and other Securities at the time Outstanding to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and each other series of Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes and other series of affected Securities, to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past Defaults (other than with respect to nonpayment or in respect of a provision that cannot be waived without the written consent of each Holder affected) under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and
offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results
 
 
Fourth quarter and full year highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - January 24, 2011  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $85.0 million, or 92 cents per share, compared to fourth quarter 2009 earnings of $62.3 million, or 68 cents per share. The Company reported net sales of $605.0 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to net sales of $558.2 million in the fourth quarter 2009.
Earnings for the full year 2010 were $323.7 million, or $3.51 per share, compared to $178.4 million, or $1.94 per share, for 2009. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs at our Bergheim, Germany site in the first quarter 2010, and the special and one-time tax items reported for 2009, earnings for 2010 were $328.3 million, or $3.56 per share, and earnings for 2009 were $171.4 million, or $1.86 per share. Total net sales for 2010 were $2.36 billion compared to $2.01 billion for 2009.
 
"Our results in the fourth quarter cap a year of tremendous progress for our Company, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our team's ability to drive operational efficiencies," said Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO of Albemarle. "We ended 2010 with very solid results, achieving record annual earnings of $3.56 per share, all-time high EBITDA of $545 million and a solid balance sheet to support strategic growth opportunities. As we begin the new year, our businesses are off to a strong start. We expect ongoing demand for our products, combined with the strength of our core technologies and key market insights to drive solid earnings growth in 2011."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales in the fourth quarter 2010 of $220.0 million, an 8 percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter 2009, due primarily to favorable price and mix, partly offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency impacts. Polymer Solutions segment income for the fourth quarter 2010 was $51.0 million, a 57 percent increase from $32.4 million in the fourth quarter 2009. This increase was due primarily to favorable pricing and mix, partly offset by lower volumes.
Catalysts generated net sales in the fourth quarter 2010 of $231.6 million, an 11 percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter 2009, due primarily to higher volumes and favorable pricing, partly offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Catalysts segment income for the fourth quarter 2010 was $58.5 million, a 40 percent increase from $41.8 million in the fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was attributable primarily to higher volumes and favorable pricing, improved realization of metals costs in hydroprocessing catalysts and higher equity income from our Catalysts joint ventures.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the fourth quarter 2010 were $153.4 million, a five percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter 2009, due primarily to favorable pricing, mix and sales volumes, partly offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Fine Chemistry segment income for the fourth quarter 2010 was $26.3 million, up 39 percent compared to $19.0 million in the fourth quarter 2009. This improvement in segment income was due primarily to favorable pricing and mix as well as favorable sales and production volumes, partly offset by higher variable input costs.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 was $20.8 million and $73.0 million, respectively. The increase over the comparable periods in 2009 was due mainly to higher personnel-related costs. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2009 included a favorable $7.8 million adjustment associated with the reversal of certain long-term employee benefit accruals.
 
Cash Flow
In 2010, we incurred capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $75.5 million, dividends to shareholders of $49.6 million and $80.1 million in contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company repurchased approximately 400,356 shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $14.9 million during the year. During December 2010, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2020. The proceeds from this issuance have been used primarily to pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to make voluntary pension contributions during December 2010 and January 2011. Interest and financing expenses for the fourth quarter 2010 were $7.5 million versus fourth quarter 2009 expenses of $6.0 million due primarily to higher average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings during the 2010 period.
At December 31, 2010, the Company had $529.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has additional capacity to borrow in excess of $791 million under existing lines of credit with no significant debt maturities before 2013.
Taxes
Our fourth quarter and full year 2010 effective income tax rates were 22.6 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively, before special items. Excluding special and one-time tax items, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 effective income tax rates were 14.9 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and has benefited from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
Continued success with innovative product development, further improvements in productivity, positive market trends and implementation of announced price increases should provide the basis for both top and bottom-line growth in 2011. As we further leverage our core technologies and strategic partnerships around the world, we are positioning Albemarle for long-term growth.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2010 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard time on January 25, 2011. The call can be accessed by dialing 866-314-9013 (International Dial In # 617-213-8053), and entering conference ID 64836501.

This AWARD, made as of the 31st day of January, 2011,
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The EBIT % of Target Units is determined according to the following table (awards to be interpolated between the dollar amounts and Trigger listed below):
EBIT % of Target Units.
 
 
"EBIT" is combined income of each segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the Measurement Period as determined by the Company for such purpose provided, however, that in accordance with the Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
"Cumulative EBIT" is EBIT for each calendar year in the Measurement Period added together.
"EBITDA" and "Net Sales" is the cumulative EBITDA and Net Sales for each calendar year in the Measurement Period.
For purposes of the above calculations, EBIT % of Target Units will be rounded to the nearest whole percent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Number of Units to be vested and paid = (QC/8) x (AP/TP) x Number of Target Units + ((8-QC)/8) x Number of Target Units
Where: QC = the number of completed calendar quarters of the performance period prior to a Change in Control.
AP = actual performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.
TP = target performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.

5. . This option shall be exercised through a licensed brokerage firm at Participant's expense, in conjunction with established procedures and coordinated with the Company's Human Resources and Law Departments. From time to time the procedures for exercising this option may be subject to modification by the aforesaid departments, but in no case shall the number of shares subject to the option or its terms for vesting be changed by the procedures for exercise or by the modification thereof. Procedures for the exercise of this option will be provided to Participant by the Company's Human Resources Department.
Method of Exercising and Payment for Shares
6. . This option is nontransferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During Participant's lifetime, this option may be exercised only by Participant.
Nontransferability
7. . If the Participant dies while employed by the Company or an Affiliate, after one year following the date the option was granted and prior to the Expiration Date, this option (to the extent not already Vested) shall become Vested as to a pro-rata portion of the option; such pro-rata portion shall be determined as follows: the option (i) shall be Vested as to one-third of the option for each completed year of service by the Participant during the Vesting period and prior to death, and (ii) shall be Vested as to a fraction of one-third of the option for any partial year of service (other than the first year after the option is granted), where the numerator of such fraction is the number of days in the year prior to Participant's death, and the denominator of such fraction is 365. The non-Vested portion of the option shall be forfeited. The Vested portion of the option may be immediately exercised and shall remain exercisable according to the terms provided in Paragraph 4, notwithstanding the date of death. This option may be exercised by Participant's beneficiary. Participant shall have the right to designate his beneficiary on a form filed with the Committee. If Participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if at the time of his death there is no surviving beneficiary, this option may be exercised by his estate. Participant's beneficiary (or estate as the case may be) may exercise this option during the remainder of the period preceding the Expiration Date.
Vesting and Exercise in the Event of Death
8. . If the Participant becomes permanently and totally disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) ("Disabled") while employed by the Company or an Affiliate, after one year following the date the option was granted and prior to the Expiration Date, this option shall become Vested as to a pro-rata portion of the option; such pro-rata portion shall be determined as follows: the option (i) shall be Vested as to one-third of the option for each completed year of service by the Participant during the Vesting period and prior to the Disability, and (ii) shall be Vested as to a fraction of one-third of the option for any partial year of service (other than the first year after the option is granted), where the numerator of such fraction is the number of days in the year prior to Participant's Disability, and the denominator of such fraction is 365. The non-Vested portion of the option shall be forfeited. The Vested portion of the option may be immediately exercised and shall remain exercisable according to the terms provided in Paragraph 4, notwithstanding the date of permanent and total disability. The Participant may exercise this option during the remainder of the period preceding the Expiration Date.
Vesting and Exercise in the Event of Permanent and Total Disability
9. . In the event that the Participant Retires from the employ of the Company or an Affiliate after one year following the date the option was granted and prior to the Expiration Date, this option shall become Vested as to a pro-rata portion of the option; such pro-rata portion shall be determined as follows: the option (i) shall be Vested as to one-third of the option for each completed year of service by the Participant during the Vesting period, and (ii) shall be Vested as to a fraction of one-third of the option for any partial year of service (other than the first year after the option is granted), where the numerator of such fraction is the number of days in the year prior to Participant's Retirement, and the denominator of such fraction is 365. The non-Vested portion of the option shall be forfeited. Participant may exercise the Vested portion of the option with respect to the shares he is entitled to purchase, as of the date the option would have become exercisable pursuant to paragraph 4 above, provided that the option must be exercised during the remainder of the period preceding the Expiration Date. For purposes of this Grant, the terms "Retires" and "Retirement" mean separation from service on or after Participant has satisfied the
Vesting and Exercise in the Event of Retirement
 
requirements for an early, normal or delayed retirement allowance under a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate. The preceding sentence shall not apply to a separation from service following the date that Participant is advised (upon recommendation by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation) that his employment is being, or will be, terminated for Cause, on account of performance or in circumstances that prevent him from being in good standing with the Company, in which case all rights under this Grant shall terminate, and this option shall expire on the date of Participant's termination of employment.
10. . Except as provided in paragraphs 7, 8, or 9, in the event Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate, the rules under this paragraph 10 shall apply. If Participant ceases to be employed prior to the time any portion of the option is Vested, such non-Vested portion of the option shall be forfeited. If Participant ceases to be employed after the option is Vested, but prior to the Expiration Date, Participant may exercise this option with respect to the shares he is entitled to purchase pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 above within sixty (60) days of the date of such termination of employment (but in no event later than the Expiration Date).
Vesting and Exercise After Termination of Employment
11. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice of Award, all shares of the option not previously forfeited shall become Vested and exercisable on a Change in Control as defined in the Plan.
Change in Control
12. . Fractional shares shall not be issuable hereunder, and when any provision hereof may entitle Participant to a fractional share such fraction shall be disregarded.
Fractional Shares
13. . This option does not confer upon Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company or an Affiliate, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate his employment at any time.
No Right to Continued Employment
14. . The terms of this option shall be adjusted as the Committee determines is equitable in the event the Company effects one or more stock dividends, stock split-ups, subdivisions or consolidations of shares or other similar changes in capitalization.
Change in Capital Structure
15. . This Grant shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. All disputes arising under this Grant shall be adjudicated solely within the state or federal courts located within the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
2011 Base Salaries
On February 28, 2011, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company) established the following base salaries for the named executive officers that are effective as of April 1, 2011: Mark C. Rohr ($900,000); Luther C. Kissam IV ($625,000); John M. Steitz ($572,000); Scott A. Tozier ($400,000); and John J. Nicols ($410,000).
2011 Annual Incentive Plan
On February 28, 2011, the Committee approved the 2011 annual incentive plan target percentages for the named executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Committee are met for 2011. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mark C. Rohr (120%); Luther C. Kissam IV (85%); John M. Steitz (75%); Scott A. Tozier (60%); and John J. Nicols (60%). The named executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide metrics. For superior corporate performance, up to two times target may be earned. In addition, based on specific individual performance goals, an additional amount may be earned up to the set maximum potential bonus. The maximum amounts payable for 2011 are as follows: Mark C. Rohr ($3,240,000); Luther C. Kissam IV ($1,593,750); John M. Steitz ($1,287,000); Scott A. Tozier ($720,000); and John J. Nicols ($738,000). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2011, if EBITDA excluding special items exceeds 5% of Net Sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to the named executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the targets described above. The Committee bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. The Committee also established the annual incentive plan company-wide metrics for 2010 bonuses based on the following factors: EBIT (60%), cash flow from operations (30%) and stewardship (10%), which includes metrics related to safety and the environment. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2011 will be paid in the first quarter of 2012.
"EBIT" is combined income of each segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the measurement period as determined by the Company for such purpose provided, however, that in accordance with the Incentive Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Record Quarterly Sales, Income and EPS
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - April 19, 2011 
First quarter 2011 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2011 earnings of $106.6 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to first quarter 2010 earnings of $63.3 million, or 69 cents per share. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs at our Bergheim, Germany site in the first quarter of 2010, earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $67.9 million, or $0.74 per share. The Company reported net sales of $696.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to net sales of $580.3 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "I am extremely pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved our highest quarterly earnings and EBITDA in the Company's history, as well as record income levels for all three of our operating segments. We continue to benefit from improving trends in the markets served by our businesses and our keen focus on cost control and cash generation. We expect the strength of our core technologies and key market insights to continue to drive solid earnings growth in 2011."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $258.2 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 19 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to favorable pricing. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $69.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 66 percent increase from $41.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. This increase was due primarily to favorable pricing, partly offset by higher variable input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Catalysts generated net sales of $261.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 15 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to higher volumes and favorable pricing. Catalysts segment income was $72.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 32 percent increase from $55.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. This improvement was attributable primarily to higher volumes and favorable pricing, offset in part by higher variable input costs. Also, first quarter 2011 Catalysts segment income benefited from higher equity income versus first quarter 2010.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the first quarter of 2011 were $177.3 million, a 30 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2010, due mainly to higher volumes as well as favorable pricing. Fine Chemistry segment income for the first quarter of 2011 was $29.5 million, up 151 percent compared to $11.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. This improvement in segment income was due primarily to higher volumes and favorable pricing, partly offset by higher variable input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $23.6 million for the first quarter of 2011. The increase over the comparable period in 2010 was due mainly to higher personnel-related costs.
Cash Flow
In the three months ended March 31, 2011, cash on hand funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $31.9 million and dividends to shareholders of $12.9 million. Additionally, we made repayments of long-term debt of $100.6 million and pension and postretirement contributions of $51.9 million during the first quarter of 2011. Interest and financing expenses increased to $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings during the 2011 period. At March 31, 2011, the Company had $441.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.
 
Taxes
Our first quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 24.2 percent versus 23.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the special item, our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 24.4 percent. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Outlook
Positive market trends, coupled with continued success in new product development and rigorous cost controls, should provide the basis for strong top and bottom-line growth in 2011. Our balanced portfolio, geographic reach and commitment to operational excellence position Albemarle for long-term growth.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on April 20, 2011. The call can be accessed by dialing 866-700-6067 (International Dial In # 617-213-8834), and entering conference ID 61127439.

Effective as of May 11, 2011, the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") amended Section 2 of Article II of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws to decrease the size of the Board of Directors to ten directors. The Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
On May 11, 2011, the Company held its Annual Meeting. During this meeting, stockholders of the Company were asked to consider and vote upon four proposals: (1) election of the ten nominees set forth in the 2011 Proxy Statement to the Board of Directors, (2) approval of a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, (3) ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (4) designation of frequency of periodic advisory votes on executive compensation.
As of the record date for the Annual Meeting, March 2, 2011, there were 91,651,359 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, of which the holders of 82,985,158 shares of common stock were represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. For each proposal, the results of the shareholder voting were as follows:
1. Election of directors. All of the nominees for directors were elected to serve for a term which expires at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2012, by the votes set forth in the table below.
 
There were 7,336,066 Broker Non-Votes received for each nominee.
2. Advisory vote on executive compensation. The stockholders approved on a non-binding advisory basis the compensation of the Company's named executive officers by the votes set forth in the table below.
 
3. Ratification of appointment of independent registered public accounting firm. The appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 was ratified by the stockholders by the votes set forth in the table below.
 
The proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC was a routine matter and, therefore, there were no broker non-votes relating to this matter.
4. Frequency of periodic advisory votes on executive compensation. The stockholders voted upon a non-binding advisory proposal as to the frequency with which the non-binding shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers should be conducted as set forth in the table below.
 
Based on these results, the Company's Board of Directors has determined to hold its advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers annually until the next frequency vote. A frequency vote is required to be held at least once every six years.

Shareholder Proposals
(a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.
(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only (A) pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any shareholder of the Company who was a shareholder of record of the Company who is entitled to vote at the meeting at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section.
(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for
 
shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such
 
business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this section is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the
 
purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section (including whether the shareholder or beneficial

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the shareholder (or a designated representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.
(ii) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Second Consecutive Record Quarter
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - July 21, 2011 
Second quarter 2011 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2011 earnings of $114.2 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to second quarter 2010 earnings of $81.8 million, or 89 cents per share. The Company reported net sales of $742.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to net sales of $592.5 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Earnings for the first half of 2011 were $220.7 million, or $2.38 per share, compared to $145.1 million, or $1.57 per share, for the first half of 2010. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2010, earnings for the first half of 2010 were $149.7 million, or $1.62 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2011 were $1.44 billion compared to $1.17 billion for the first half of 2010.
Commenting on results, Mark C. Rohr, Chairman and CEO, stated, "We are pleased to report record sales and earnings for the second consecutive quarter driven by stronger volume and pricing trends. Robust business demand helped establish new earnings records for Fine Chemistry and Polymer Solutions. Catalysts volumes are
 
showing signs of continued strengthening as we enter the second half of 2011. Overall, while we will remain alert to any indications of slower global growth going forward, we are optimistic about our prospects for the second half of the year."
Quarterly Segment Results
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $290.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 23 percent increase over net sales in the second quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $77.2 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 64 percent increase from $47.0 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was due primarily to favorable pricing, partly offset by higher variable input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Catalysts generated net sales of $266.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 24 percent increase over net sales in the second quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing and higher volumes. Catalysts segment income was $65.6 million in the second quarter of 2011, roughly flat with second quarter of 2010 results of $66.2 million. Catalysts segment income for the second quarter of 2011 was favorably impacted primarily by higher pricing and higher equity income while offset mainly by higher variable input costs versus the second quarter of 2010.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the second quarter of 2011 were $184.8 million, a 31 percent increase over net sales in the second quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing and higher volumes. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $37.4 million for the second quarter of 2011, more than double second quarter 2010 results of $17.5 million. This improvement in segment income was due primarily to the favorable sales gains noted above, partly offset by higher variable input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $25.8 million for the second quarter of 2011. The increase over the comparable period in 2010 was due mainly to higher personnel-related costs.
Interest and financing expenses increased to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $6.0 million for the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher average interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the 2011 period.
Our second quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 21.7 percent versus 24.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010. The full year 2011 effective tax rate is expected to be 22.9 percent. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $146 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and we had $490.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2011. In the first half of 2011, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $67.6 million (versus $33.9 million in the first half of 2010) and dividends to shareholders of $28.0 million. Additionally, we made repayments of long-term debt of $105.2 million and pension and postretirement contributions of $55.8 million during the first half of 2011.
Outlook
Our outlook for the second half of 2011 remains positive while we continue to monitor global economic developments for any signs of slower growth. We expect some typical seasonal contraction and potential volume softness in the fourth quarter; however, we believe our continued focus on innovative product development, operational excellence and cost control programs positions us well to deliver solid financial performance for the remainder of the year.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011 will be discussed on a conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on July 22, 2011.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 22, 2011, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") and Albemarle Global Finance Company SCA (the "Belgian Borrower"), as borrowers, entered into a $750,000,000, five-year, revolving, unsecured credit facility (the "New Credit Facility") with the several banks and other financial institutions as may from time to time become parties thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, (collectively, the "Lenders"). The New Credit Facility permits certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries (the "Company Subsidiaries") to become parties to the New Credit Facility as borrowers from time to time. The New Credit Facility amended and restated an earlier credit facility that provided for a $675 million revolving credit facility ("Prior Credit Facility") that was due to mature in part on March 23, 2012 and in part on March 23, 2013, but has now been amended and restated. The Company used the initial borrowings under the New Credit Facility to pay off any outstanding debts under its Prior Credit Facility.
The New Credit Facility matures on September 22, 2016. Twice during the term of the New Credit Facility (but not more than one time in any twelve month period), the Company can request that the maturity date of the New Credit Facility be extended for an additional one-year period with any such extension being subject to the approval of the Lenders under the New Credit Facility. Up to five times during the term of the New Credit Facility, the Company has the right, upon prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and without the consent of the Lenders, to increase the aggregate commitments under the New Credit Facility by up to an additional $250,000,000 in the aggregate.
The New Credit Facility allows borrowings by the Company and by the Belgian Borrower, with borrowings by the Belgian Borrower denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based on an average London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.900% to 1.400%, depending on the Company's credit rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. As of the closing of the New Credit Facility, the applicable margin over LIBOR was 0.975%. The New Credit Facility also permits the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans. In addition, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries guarantees to the Lenders all of the obligations of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Belgian Borrower under the New Credit Facility, the notes and the other loan documents, including any obligations under hedging arrangements.
The New Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, including compliance with a financial covenant requiring that the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Facility, be not more than 3.5:1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The New Credit Facility also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, defaults for breach of representations and warranties, defaults for insolvency, defaults for non-performance of covenants, cross-defaults and guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the facility being terminated.
This description of the New Credit Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the entire New Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

On October 13, 2011, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the number of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase under its share repurchase program (the "Program"). The Board of Directors initially authorized the Program on February 8, 1994, permitting the Company to repurchase up to six million shares. Since then, the Company has regularly repurchased shares under the Program, resulting in the Board of Directors periodically authorizing additional shares for repurchase. The October 13, 2011 authorization permits the Company to repurchase up to five million shares, including those shares previously authorized, but not yet repurchased. The Program will expire when the Company has repurchased all the shares authorized under the updated Program or if the Board of Directors earlier terminates the Program. Should the Company repurchase all or most of the shares currently authorized, the Board, in the future, may decide to authorize additional shares under the Program.
The press release issued by the Company on October 13, 2011, announcing the increase in the share repurchase program, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
d) Exhibit.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Third Consecutive Record Quarter
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - October 24, 2011 
Third quarter 2011 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2011 earnings of $116.1 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 earnings of $93.7 million, or $1.02 per share. The Company reported net sales of $723.0 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to net sales of $585.0 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $336.8 million, or $3.66 per share, compared to $238.7 million, or $2.59 per share, for the same period in 2010. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2010, earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $243.3 million, or $2.64 per share. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $2.2 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the same period in 2010.
 
Commenting on results, Luke Kissam, President and CEO, stated, "We're pleased to announce record earnings for the third consecutive quarter. Catalysts' record performance and the continued strength of the Fine Chemistry business more than offset the expected volume softness seen in Polymer Solutions this quarter versus the first half of the year. These earnings are a testament to our competitive cost position, execution of our pricing strategies and the innovation of our people."
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $299.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, a 39 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing and volume impacts as well as favorable impacts from foreign currency. Catalysts segment income was $101.9 million in the third quarter of 2011, up 48 percent over third quarter 2010 results of $68.9 million due primarily to the favorable pricing gains noted above, partly offset mainly by higher variable input costs versus the third quarter of 2010.
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $243.9 million in the third quarter of 2011, a five percent increase over net sales in the third quarter of 2010, due to favorable pricing and foreign currency impacts partially offset by lower volumes. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $54.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, a seven percent decline from $58.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to lower volumes and higher variable input costs, partly offset by favorable pricing.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the third quarter of 2011 were $179.5 million, a 30 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing and volume impacts. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $30.0 million for the third quarter of 2011, over 80 percent higher than third quarter 2010 results of $16.5 million. This improvement in segment income was due primarily to the favorable pricing and volume performance noted above, partly offset by higher variable input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $23.5 million for the third quarter of 2011. The increase over the comparable period in 2010 was due mainly to higher personnel-related costs.
Interest and financing expenses increased to $9.7 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher average interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the 2011 period.
Our third quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 25.1 percent versus 24.1 percent in the third quarter of 2010. The full year 2011 effective tax rate is expected to be 23.7 percent. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $285 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and we had $481.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $127.1 million (versus $50.0 million in the same period of 2010) and dividends to shareholders of $43.1 million. During the third quarter of 2011, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock as authorized under the terms of our stock repurchase plan. Additionally, we made repayments of long-term debt of $105.1 million and pension and postretirement contributions of $57.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
On September 22, 2011, we amended and restated our previous $675.0 million credit facility. Under the terms of the amended and restated five-year, revolving, unsecured credit facility, we have the ability to borrow $750.0 million, which may be increased by an additional $250.0 million. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus a spread, currently 0.975%, that varies with our debt rating. We had $120.0 million in outstanding borrowings on this facility at September 30, 2011.
Outlook
We are closely monitoring customer order patterns and other performance trends in our businesses and the markets which they serve in light of current uncertainties in the global economy. While we expect the typical slower year end order patterns in some of our businesses, we believe our businesses are fundamentally strong and still expect that our second half 2011 results will be similar to the first half of the year. We expect to end 2011 well positioned for another successful year in 2012.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011 will be discussed on a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on October 25, 2011. The call can be accessed by dialing 800-299-7928 (International Dial In # 617-614-3926), and entering conference ID 71549443.

(ii)         For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the
11/2/11
 
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise, required in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as such a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Company, the language of the
11/2/11
 
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and for the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Company of his intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or
11/2/11
 
persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") elected Joseph M. Mahady to serve as a Director of the Company, effective as of February 1, 2012, until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company and until his successor is elected and qualified. The Board of Directors did not appoint Mr. Mahady to serve on any Board committees at this time. Mr. Mahady will be eligible to participate in the Company's compensation arrangements for non-employee directors, as described in the Company's 2011 Proxy Statement.
Mr. Mahady, 57, retired in 2009 as President of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a division of Wyeth Corporation ("Wyeth"). Prior to being acquired by Pfizer Inc. in 2009, Wyeth developed, manufactured, and marketed pharmaceutical products to treat cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, infectious diseases, cancer, women's health concerns, and depression. Prior to serving as President of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mr. Mahady served as Senior Vice President of Wyeth from 2002 to 2009. He began his career at Wyeth in 1977 and held a number of positions of increasing responsibility at Wyeth for his thirty-two year career. Mr. Mahady is a former director of Immunex.
The press release issued by the Company on December 12, 2011 announcing Mr. Mahady's election to the Company's Board of Directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
On December 9, 2011, the Company entered into a severance compensation agreement (the "Severance Compensation Agreement") with Scott A. Tozier, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Severance Compensation Agreement provides the compensation that Mr. Tozier is entitled to receive in the event of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Severance Compensation Agreement).
The Severance Compensation Agreement provides that, in the event of a Change in Control, Mr. Tozier will be entitled to (i) vesting of any outstanding but unvested stock options and restricted stock, (ii) payment of earned but not yet vested performance units and (iii) payment of a portion of unearned and unvested performance units. Additionally, in the event of a Change in Control and upon termination of employment other than for cause (as defined in the Severance Compensation Agreement), upon death after the execution of a definitive agreement which results in a Change in Control, or upon good reason for resignation (as defined in the Severance Compensation Agreement), Mr. Tozier will also be entitled to (iv) base salary and vacation pay accrued through the termination date, for the year in which the termination occurs, (v) accrued annual cash incentive award, (vi) a lump sum severance payment calculated in accordance with the Severance Compensation Agreement, (vii) immediate vesting of certain benefits under our supplemental executive retirement plan and (viii) other insurance and counseling benefits.
The Severance Compensation Agreement contains a one-year non-competition agreement for which Mr. Tozier will receive consideration equal to the greater of the executive's annual base salary which was payable immediately prior to termination and immediately prior to a Change in Control plus the amount of his actual annual cash incentive award for the year preceding the date of the Change in Control. The severance payment will also be offset by the payment for the non-competition agreement.
The preceding discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Severance Compensation Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Termination Benefits
 
 
In addition, if the Date of Termination is other than the first day of a Variable Compensation Year, the Corporation shall pay you Incentive Compensation for the Variable Compensation Year in which the Date of Termination occurs, equal to the target variable compensation for the year in which the Change in Control occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of days which have elapsed in the current Variable Compensation Year to the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365).

(b) If you are not eligible for the retiree medical plans, you will no longer continue to participate in the Corporation's medical benefit plans, except for COBRA, and (i) if you elect to receive COBRA benefits, the Corporation shall provide you with such benefits at no cost to you for eighteen (18) months following your loss of medical coverage.
 
 
 
(a) the greater of your annual base compensation which was payable to you by the Corporation immediately prior to the Date of Termination and your annual base compensation which was payable to you by the Corporation immediately prior to a Change in Control, whether or not such annual base compensation was includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes; plus
(b) the greater of your target annual variable compensation that was in place immediately prior to a Change in Control, or your target annual variable compensation that was in place immediately prior to the Date of Termination (whether or not such award was includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes).
The Severance Payment shall be reduced by the amount paid to you under Paragraph 7(c) below.
 
If the payments or benefits to which you will be entitled under this Agreement (referred to in this Paragraph as the "Payments") would cause you to be liable for the federal excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute payments" under Code Section 4999 ("Excise Tax"), then the Payments shall be reduced (or repaid to the Corporation, if previously paid or provided) as provided below. In no event shall you be entitled to receive any kind of gross-up payment or Excise Tax reimbursement from the Corporation. For purposes of this Paragraph (viii), the terms "excess parachute payment" and "parachute payment" will have the meanings assigned to them by Section 280G of the Code.
If your Payments exceed 2.99 times your "Base Amount" (as defined in Code Section 280G), a "reduced payment amount" shall be calculated by reducing the Payments to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any Payment, as so reduced or repaid, constitutes an "excess parachute payment." If it is determined that any Excise Tax is payable by you, you shall receive either (i) all Payments otherwise due to you or (ii) the reduced payment amount described in the preceding sentence, whichever will provide you with the greater after-tax economic benefit taking into account for these purposes any applicable Excise Tax.
Whether Payments to you are to be reduced, pursuant to this Paragraph, and the extent to which they are to be so reduced, will be determined by the Corporation in good faith and the Corporation will notify you in writing of its determination. Any such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis of the Corporation's determination. If you accept the Corporation's determination, you shall so advise the Corporation of your determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation. If you object to such determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Corporation, the Corporation will retain, at its expense, a nationally recognized public accounting firm, employment consulting firm or law firm selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to you to review the matter. Such firm shall meet with you and your representatives and the Corporation and its representatives and thereafter render its written opinion as to the extent, if any, that in such firm's reasonable judgment the payments and benefits otherwise due to you hereunder must be reduced hereunder. The decision of such firm concerning the extent of any required reduction in such payments and benefits shall be final and binding on both you and the Corporation.
 
 
b. . During any period prior to the Date of Termination and during the term of this Agreement that you are unable to perform your full-time duties with the Corporation, whether as a result of your Total Disability or as a result of a physical or mental disability that is not total or is not permanent and therefore is not a Total Disability, you shall continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all other compensation and benefits that are payable or provided under the Corporation's benefit plans, including its disability plans. After the Date of Termination, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program, insurance and other applicable programs. The compensation and benefits, other than salary, payable or provided pursuant to this Paragraph 2b shall be the greater of (x) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control and (y) the amounts computed under the Pension Program, disability benefit plans, insurance and other applicable programs in effect at the time the compensation and benefits are paid.
Payments While Disabled
c. . If your employment shall be terminated by the Corporation for Cause or by you other than with Good Reason for Resignation, the Corporation shall pay you your full base salary and accrued vacation pay then in effect through the Date of Termination, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given plus any benefits or awards which have been earned or become payable but which have not yet been paid to you. You shall receive any payment due under this subsection c. on your Date of Termination. Thereafter the Corporation shall have no further obligation to you under this Agreement.
Payments if Termination for Cause, or by You Except With Good Reason
d. . If your employment shall be terminated by your Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's Pension Program and insurance programs then in effect except that if your death occurs after the execution of a definitive agreement which results in a Change in Control, then your beneficiary shall be entitled to the benefits under this Agreement as if the Corporation issued you a Notice of Termination terminating your employment thirty (30) days after a Change in Control.
After Retirement or Death
3. .
Vesting Upon a Change in Control
a. Upon a Change in Control, all unvested stock options and restricted stock held by you under the Incentive Compensation Programs shall immediately vest and be non-forfeitable.

4. . This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2011; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2012 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless, not later than September 30 of the preceding year, the Corporation or you shall have given notice that it or you do not wish to extend this Agreement. Notwithstanding any such notice by the Corporation or you not to extend the Agreement, if a Change in Control shall have occurred prior to such termination of this Agreement, the attempted termination of this Agreement shall be deemed ineffective and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information of the Corporation known to you, and which gives the Corporation a competitive advantage, relating to the Corporation's business, but shall not include information generally available to or known by the public or information that is or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Corporation or its directors, officers or employees (other than by reason of a breach of any obligation of confidentiality).

Validity

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Record Full Year 2011 Results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - January 23, 2012 
Fourth quarter 2011 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $99.4 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $85.0 million, or $0.92 per share. The Company reported net sales of $707.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to net sales of $605.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Earnings for the full year 2011 were $436.3 million, or $4.77 per share, compared to $323.7 million, or $3.51 per share, for 2010. Excluding the $7.0 million ($4.6 million after tax, or 5 cents per share) charge for restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2010, earnings for 2010 were $328.3 million, or $3.56 per share. Net sales for 2011 were $2.9 billion compared to $2.4 billion for 2010.
"We are very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results which capped a record year at Albemarle during which each of our business segments recorded the highest revenue and profitability in our history," said Luke Kissam, President and CEO. "Despite a challenging operating environment in the second half of the year, we grew revenue by 21% to $2.9 billion and earnings by 34% to $4.77 per share. We closed the year with a very strong balance sheet, which gives us the financial flexibility to fund growth opportunities. These results, which are a credit to the strength of our businesses and the innovation of our employees, put us on track to achieve our Vision 2015 goals."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $289.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 25 percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable pricing. Catalysts segment income was $83.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 43 percent over fourth quarter 2010 results of $58.5 million due primarily to favorable pricing gains while partly offset mainly by higher input costs and lower equity income versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $209.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 5 percent decrease over net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, with favorable impacts from pricing and foreign currency being offset overall by lower volumes. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 28 percent decline from $51.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to lower volumes and higher input costs, partly offset by favorable pricing.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $208.5 million, a 36 percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, due mainly to favorable volumes and pricing. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $42.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, over 60 percent higher than fourth quarter 2010 results of $26.3 million, due primarily to favorable pricing and volume performance, partly offset by higher input costs and higher charges attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 was $24.6 million and $97.5 million, respectively. The increase over the comparable periods in 2010 was due primarily to higher personnel-related costs including performance-based incentive compensation and pension costs.
Interest and financing expenses were $9.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, with this increase due primarily to higher average interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the 2011 period.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2011 effective income tax rates were 23.3 percent and 23.6 percent, respectively. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $490 million for the full year 2011, and we had $469.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011. During 2011, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of approximately $198.0 million (which includes approximately $40.0 million in capital expenditures associated with our Jordan Bromine joint venture), long-term debt repayments of $109.6 million, pension and postretirement contributions of $59.8 million, dividends to shareholders of $57.8 million and repurchases of $178.1 million of our common stock.
Outlook
In the second half of 2011, the global economic uncertainty contributed to conservative cash management and lower demand in certain supply chains, and this was particularly true in our Polymer Solutions segment. How long that uncertainty will last is not clear at this time. However, our businesses remain healthy, and we believe the end markets we serve may stabilize or accelerate in the second half of 2012.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2011 will be discussed on a conference call at 8:00 AM Eastern Standard time on January 24, 2012. The call can be accessed by dialing 800-901-5217 (International Dial In # 617-786-2964), and entering conference ID 62911660.

These measures are presented here to provide additional useful measurements to review our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
A description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, can be found in the Investors section of our website at , under "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" under "Financials."

The Company has reported segment operating profit, segment income, EBITDA and EBITDA excluding special items because management believes that these financial measures provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Segment operating profit, segment income, EBITDA and EBITDA excluding special items should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
See below for a reconciliation of segment operating profit and segment income, the non-GAAP financial measures, to operating profit and net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, respectively, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

New President Named
On February 24, 2012, the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") appointed John M. Steitz, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer, effective March 1, 2012. Mr. Steitz, age 53, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer effective April 11, 2007. He previously served as Senior Vice President, Business Operations from January 2004 until April 2007, Vice President, Business Operations from October 2002 until January 2004, and Vice President, Fine Chemistry from July 2000 until October 2002. Luther C. Kissam, IV, the Company's current President and Chief Executive Officer, will continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer after Mr. Steitz begins his term as President. Details of Mr. Steitz's compensation are set forth below. Mr. Steitz has been, and will continue to be, entitled to participate in the Company's benefit plans and programs to the same extent as the other senior executives of the Company.
A copy of the press release issued on February 27, 2012, announcing Mr. Steitz's promotion to President, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The compensation of the Company's named executive officers is set forth below.
2012 Base Salaries
On February 24, 2012, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") established the following base salaries for the Company's named executive officers effective as of April 1, 2012: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($800,000); John M. Steitz ($592,000); Scott A. Tozier ($425,000); John J. Nicols ($425,000); and Karen G. Narwold ($388,000).
2012 Annual Incentive Plan
On February 24, 2012, the Committee approved the 2012 annual incentive plan target award percentages for the named executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to three times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Committee are met for 2012. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV (100%); John M. Steitz (75%); Scott A. Tozier (60%); John J. Nicols (60%); and Karen G. Narwold (60%). The named executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide metrics. For superior corporate performance, up to two times target may be earned. Further, based on specific individual performance goals, an additional amount may be earned up to the set maximum potential bonus. The maximum amounts payable for 2012 are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($2,400,000); John M. Steitz ($1,332,000); Scott A. Tozier ($765,000); John J. Nicols ($765,000); and Karen G. Narwold ($700,000). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2012, if EBITDA excluding special items exceeds 5% of Net Sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to the named executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the actual company performance, individual performance, and
award targets described above. The Committee bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. The Committee also established the annual incentive plan company-wide metrics for 2012 bonuses based on the following factors: EBIT (60%), cash flow from operations (30%) and stewardship (10%), which includes metrics related to safety, the environment, sustainability and governance. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2012 will be paid in the first quarter of 2013.
"EBIT" is combined income of each business segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the measurement period as determined by the Company for such purpose; provided, however, that in accordance with the Incentive Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
2012 Long Term Incentive Grant
On February 24, 2012, the Committee approved a total grant value of up to $18,000,000 comprised of: (i) Stock Options, which will vest in three equal installments over three years beginning on February 24, 2013 and expiring February 24, 2022; (ii) Performance Stock Units ("PSUs") based on certain performance metrics; and (iii) Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") vesting on February 24, 2015. Each of the grants listed above will be awarded to certain employees of the Company, and are subject to the terms set forth in the form of Stock Option Agreement (Exhibit 10.1), Performance Stock Unit Agreement (Exhibit 10.2) and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (Exhibit 10.3), all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
Also on February 24, 2012, the Committee granted Stock Options and PSUs to the Company's named executive officers for 2012 under the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"). The values granted to each named executive officer are included in the totals above, and are apportioned approximately 60% in the form of PSUs and approximately 40% in the form of Stock Options: Luther C. Kissam IV ($3,000,000); John M. Steitz ($1,470,000); Scott A Tozier ($725,000); John J. Nicols ($700,000); and Karen G. Narwold ($625,000). The value of PSUs included in the above figures reflects the approximate number of PSUs that each named executive officer would receive for target level performance by the Company multiplied by the grant date closing stock price.

Albemarle Reports Growth In First Quarter 2012 Results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - April 18, 2012 
First quarter 2012 highlights:
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2012 earnings of $108.0 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to first quarter 2011 earnings of $106.6 million, or $1.15 per share. The Company reported net sales of $711.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to net sales of $696.5 million in the first quarter of 2011.
"I am pleased to announce first quarter results that reflect an excellent start to 2012. Year over year earnings growth in Catalysts and Fine Chemistry points to continued strong trends in those businesses, while a sequential rebound in Polymer Solutions appears to signal the early stages of a recovery, the breadth and vigor of which remains to be seen," said Luke Kissam, CEO. "Assuming the global economic recovery continues and strengthens in the second half of the year, we continue to expect to grow our business for the full year and make further progress toward the goals we outlined in Vision 2015."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $293.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, a 12 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2011, due mainly to favorable pricing. Catalysts segment income was $82.2 million in the first quarter of 2012, up 13 percent over first quarter 2011 results of $72.6 million due primarily to favorable pricing partly offset mainly by higher input costs and lower equity income versus the first quarter of 2011.
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $228.1 million in the first quarter of 2012, a 12 percent decrease over net sales in the first quarter of 2011, with favorable impacts from pricing being offset overall by lower volumes. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $53.6 million in the first quarter of 2012, a 23 percent decline from $69.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to lower volumes as well as lower equity income, partly offset by favorable pricing and lower charges attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Jordanian joint venture.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the first quarter of 2012 were $190.1 million, a 7 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2011, due mainly to favorable pricing and volumes. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $38.6 million for the first quarter of 2012, over 30 percent higher than first quarter 2011 results of $29.5 million, due primarily to favorable pricing and volume performance and lower charges attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Jordanian joint venture, partly offset by higher input costs.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $21.9 million for the first quarter of 2012. The decrease over the comparable period in 2011 was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs including performance-based incentive compensation.
Interest and financing expenses were $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2011, with this decrease due primarily to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction project balances outstanding year over year.
Our first quarter 2012 effective income tax rate was 25.5 percent versus 24.2 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $124 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, and we had $519.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2012. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of approximately $54.8 million (which includes approximately $18.3 million in capital expenditures associated with our Jordan Bromine joint venture), long-term debt repayments of $7.1 million and dividends to shareholders of $15.6 million.
Outlook
Although uncertainty persists regarding the strength and duration of a global economic recovery, the full year outlook for Catalysts and Fine Chemistry remains favorable, supported by positive industry trends and new business opportunities. In Polymer Solutions, end-market patterns suggest a continuation of the recent gradual demand build through the second half of 2012. Overall, our businesses remain fundamentally healthy and strategically well-positioned.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012 will be discussed on a conference call at 8:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on April 19, 2012. The call can be accessed by dialing 866-831-6247 (International Dial In # 617-213-8856), and entering conference ID 37921496.

Segment operating profit, segment income, EBITDA and EBITDA excluding special items should not be considered as alternatives to Operating profit or Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
See below for a reconciliation of segment operating profit and segment income, the non-GAAP financial measures, to Operating profit and Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, respectively, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On May 17, 2012, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") announced that the Company plans to exit its existing phosphorous flame retardants business in order to restructure its business portfolio and address underperforming assets. The Company currently produces phosphorus flame retardants, part of its Polymer Solutions business segment, at its Avonmouth, United Kingdom and Nanjing, China manufacturing sites. The proposal to exit the business and cease operations at the Avonmouth, UK site is subject to consultation with its employees, which has begun. In addition, the process to cease operations at the Nanjing, China site has also begun.
As a consequence of these plans, the Company would expect to incur a one-time pre-tax accounting charge in the range of $100 million to $120 million ($80 million to $95 million after income taxes) in the second quarter 2012, which would include estimated pre-tax charges for asset write-downs ($75 million to $85 million), severance ($10 million to $15 million) and other related items. The cash outlay related to these plans is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million. Subject to the conclusion of the consultation process in the UK, production at both facilities will cease upon completion of customer contracts, currently estimated to be no later than the end of the first quarter 2013.
A copy of the press release announcing the exit is filed as Exhibit 99.1 attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
BATON ROUGE, La., May. 17, 2012  In order to restructure its business portfolio and address underperforming assets, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), a leader in the global specialty chemicals market, announced today that it plans to exit its existing phosphorous flame retardants business. Albemarle currently produces phosphorus flame retardants, part of its Polymer Solutions business segment, at its Avonmouth, United Kingdom and Nanjing, China manufacturing sites. The proposal to exit the business and cease operations at the Avonmouth, UK site is subject to consultation with its employees, which has begun. In addition, the process to cease operations at the Nanjing, China site has also begun.
The cash outlay related to the above proposals is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million with payback in approximately one year. As a consequence of these plans, the company would expect to incur a one-time after-tax accounting charge in the range of $80 million to $95 million in the second quarter 2012, which would include costs such as severance, asset write-downs and closure costs. Once these actions are completed, including a restructuring program intended to eliminate costs allocated to the phosphorus business, annual earnings per share should improve by $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2013.
"One of the fundamental drivers of Albemarle's future growth is our ability to manage our business portfolio and show discipline in addressing underperforming assets or product lines. It has become clear that our current phosphorus business and product lines are not strategically aligned with Vision 2015's growth plans," commented Luke Kissam, Albemarle's Chief Executive Officer. "We recognize the impact a proposed closure would have on our employees, their families and the communities where they live, and we will strive to minimize this impact," added Kissam.
Subject to the conclusion of the consultation process in the UK, production at both facilities will cease upon completion of customer contracts.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA  July 17, 2012 
Second quarter 2012 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported second quarter 2012 earnings of $37.7 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to second quarter 2011 earnings of $114.2 million, or $1.23 per share. Second quarter 2012 results include after-tax charges amounting to $73.6 million, or $0.82 per share, ($94.7 million before tax) in connection with our previously announced plan to exit the phosphorous flame retardants business. The Company reported net sales of $684.9 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared to net sales of $742.1 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Earnings for the first half of 2012 were $145.8 million, or $1.62 per share, compared to $220.7 million, or $2.38 per share, for the first half of 2011. Excluding after-tax charges amounting to $73.6 million, or $0.82 per share ($94.7 million before tax) for special items in the second quarter of 2012, earnings for the first half of 2012 were $219.4 million, or $2.44 per share. Net sales for the first half of 2012 were $1.40 billion compared to $1.44 billion for the first half of 2011.
"I am pleased to announce our second quarter results, which mark our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings per share growth," said Luke Kissam, CEO. "In spite of a challenging economic environment, each of our businesses delivered solid earnings and margins, and Fine Chemistry recorded its highest quarterly earnings ever. While we
 
currently are not seeing the increased market demand that we had expected in the second half of the year, our businesses remain fundamentally healthy and strategically well-positioned. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers and solid financial results through these uncertain times."
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $229.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, a 14 percent decrease from net sales in the second quarter of 2011, due mainly to a mix shift from HPC to FCC as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by higher overall volumes. Catalysts segment income was $67.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, up 2 percent over second quarter 2011 results of $65.6 million due primarily to lower input costs, offset mainly by lower equity income versus the second quarter of 2011.
Polymer Solutions delivered net sales of $247.0 million in the second quarter of 2012, a 15 percent decrease over net sales in the second quarter of 2011, due mainly to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by favorable pricing. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $64.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, a 17 percent decline from $77.2 million in the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to lower volumes, partly offset by favorable pricing, lower input costs and lower charges attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Jordanian joint venture.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the second quarter of 2012 were $208.7 million, a 13 percent increase over net sales in the second quarter of 2011, due mainly to favorable volumes and pricing, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $43.8 million for the second quarter of 2012, up 17 percent over second quarter 2011 results of $37.4 million, due primarily to favorable volume and pricing and lower charges attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Jordanian joint venture, partly offset by higher input costs.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $18.6 million for the second quarter of 2012. The decrease over the comparable period in 2011 was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs including performance-based incentive compensation.
Interest and financing expenses were $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2011, with this decrease due primarily to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction project balances outstanding year over year.
Our second quarter 2012 effective income tax rate was 34.1 percent versus 21.7 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding special items, our second quarter 2012 effective income tax rate was 26.0 percent. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income, and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $185 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and we had $461.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2012. In the first half of 2012, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of approximately $126.6 million (which includes approximately $44.0 million in capital expenditures associated with our Jordanian joint venture), long-term debt repayments of $9.4 million, dividends to shareholders of $33.4 million and repurchases of $13.7 million of our common stock.
Outlook
Uncertainty persists regarding the condition of the global economy. During the second quarter, we saw a steady deterioration of certain of the indicators that we use to gauge the health of and demand in the markets that our businesses serve, particularly within electronics. In addition, Catalysts will face challenging year-over-year comparisons.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on July 18, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA - October 17, 2012 
Third quarter 2012 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported third quarter 2012 earnings of $99.3 million, or $1.10 per share, compared to third quarter 2011 earnings of $116.1 million, or $1.28 per share. Third quarter 2012 results include $4.1 million, or $0.05 per share, in after-tax charges ($6.5 million before tax) related to a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) settlement, and $4.5 million, or $0.05 per share, of net tax benefits related principally to the release of various tax reserves. The Company reported net sales of $661.2 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to net sales of $723.0 million in the third quarter of 2011, with approximately two-thirds of the change attributable to lower metals surcharges in 2012 in the Catalysts business.
Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $245.0 million, or $2.72 per share, compared to $336.8 million, or $3.66 per share, for the same period in 2011. Excluding the third quarter 2012 special items noted above as well as the second quarter 2012 after-tax special item of $73.6 million related to our exit of the phosphorous flame retardants business, earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $318.3 million, or $3.54 per share. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the same period in 2011.
 
Commenting on results, Luke Kissam, CEO, stated "Given the challenging economic environment, we are pleased with our results. Polymer Solutions faced severe deterioration in the electronics and European construction markets, but its performance was further evidence of the improvements we have made to this business since the 2008/2009 recession. Refinery catalysts volumes were strong in the quarter, but results were negatively impacted by significant reductions in metals surcharges including rare earths. Fine Chemistry delivered 8% revenue growth due to a strong custom services pipeline and late quarter surge in shipments of completion fluids. While I expect fourth quarter to be even more difficult than was the third, I remain confident in our ability to grow our business in 2013."
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $251.2 million in the third quarter of 2012, a 16 percent decrease from net sales in the third quarter of 2011, due mainly to unfavorable impacts from lower metals surcharges in refinery catalysts and foreign currency, partially offset by higher FCC volumes. Catalysts segment income was $60.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, down 40 percent from third quarter 2011 results of $101.9 million due primarily to unfavorable impacts from metals cost volatility, fixed cost absorption and equity income versus the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by favorable sales volumes and lower spending.
Facing weaker volumes in the electronics and European construction markets, Polymer Solutions reported net sales of $217.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, an 11 percent decrease over net sales in the third quarter of 2011, due mainly to unfavorable pricing and mix, foreign currency impacts and the effects of our phosphorous flame retardants business exit in the second quarter of 2012. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $43.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, a 20 percent decline from $54.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to unfavorable pricing and mix, fixed cost absorption and foreign currency impacts, offset by lower input costs, lower charges attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Jordanian joint venture and favorable impacts from our exit of the phosphorous business.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the third quarter of 2012 were $193.0 million, an 8 percent increase over net sales in the third quarter of 2011, due mainly to favorable volumes in custom services and performance chemicals, partly offset by unfavorable pricing and foreign currency impacts. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $41.7 million for the third quarter of 2012, up 39 percent over third quarter 2011 results of $30.0 million, due primarily to favorable volume and input costs, partly offset by unfavorable pricing and foreign currency.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2012. The decrease from the comparable period in 2011 was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs associated with performance-based incentive compensation levels and related adjustments.
Interest and financing expenses were $7.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $9.7 million for the third quarter of 2011, with this decrease due primarily to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction project balances outstanding and lower variable-rate borrowings year-over-year.
 
Our third quarter 2012 effective income tax rate was 21.6 percent versus 25.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding special items (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information), our third quarter 2012 effective income tax rate was 25.9 percent. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income, and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $306 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and we had $402.6 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2012. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of approximately $218.7 million (which includes approximately $63.4 million in capital expenditures associated with our Jordanian joint venture), long-term debt repayments of $49.2 million, dividends to shareholders of $51.3 million and repurchases of $40.5 million of our common stock.
Outlook
We expect market and economic conditions to remain unstable for the foreseeable future. Polymer Solutions will likely face soft end market demand and low factory operating rates at least through Chinese New Year. While volumes in Performance Chemicals should remain strong, a temporary lull in our Custom Services business will negatively impact Fine Chemistry's fourth quarter results before continued growth in 2013. Our Catalysts business should finish the year with strong volumes and profitability as it builds toward a solid 2013. While we expect to grow our profitability in all three segments in 2013, if economic uncertainty continues, we are prepared to take appropriate steps to ensure the Company's financial strength and future growth.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on October 18, 2012. The call can be accessed by dialing 800-295-4740 (International Dial In # 617-614-3925), and entering conference ID 12536010.

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), a leader in the global specialty chemicals market, announced today that it plans to change its method of accounting for deferred actuarial gains and losses relating to its global pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans to a more preferable method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). This new accounting method, referred to as mark-to-market (MTM) accounting, will be adopted in the fourth quarter 2012 and will be retrospectively applied to the Company's financial results for all periods to be presented in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Albemarle has historically recognized actuarial gains and losses from its pension and OPEB plans in its consolidated balance sheets as Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within consolidated shareholders' equity, with amortization of these gains and losses that exceed 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or projected benefit obligations recognized each quarter in its consolidated statements of income over the average future service period of active employees. Under MTM accounting, these gains and losses will now be recognized in the year in which they occur. Also, the gain/loss subject to amortization and expected return on assets components of Albemarle's pension expense has historically been calculated using a five year smoothing of asset gains and losses referred to as the market-related value. Under MTM accounting, the market-related value of assets will equal the actual market value as of the date of measurement.
Under MTM accounting, the Company's pre-tax pension and OPEB costs for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 would have been lower than previously reported amounts by approximately $45 million. These lower costs would have resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. See the accompanying financial schedules for adjusted consolidated statements of income which show the effect of the accounting change for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, including selected quarterly information.
With the new method of accounting, the Company's pension and OPEB costs will consist of three elements: (1) ongoing items comprised of service costs and amortization of prior service costs/benefits; (2) interest costs and expected return on plan assets; and (3) MTM gains and losses recognized in the fourth quarter of each year resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets. Additionally, any interim remeasurements triggered by significant plan changes such as curtailments or settlements will be recognized as MTM adjustments in the quarter in which the event occurs.
As a result of the retrospective application of this change, Albemarle's diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $0.49 from $4.77 to $4.28. Excluding net charges amounting to $85.8 million ($54.2 million after income taxes, or $0.59 per share) that related to pension and OPEB plan actuarial net losses as well as other non-operating pension and OPEB items comprised of interest costs and expected return on assets, diluted earnings per share for 2011 would have increased from $4.28 to $4.88. See the accompanying financial schedules for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure diluted earnings per share excluding special items to diluted earnings per share computed in accordance with GAAP for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, including selected quarterly information.
Albemarle's operating segment results follow internal management reporting, which is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Historically, total pension and OPEB costs have been allocated to each of its reporting segments. In conjunction with the change to MTM, service costs (which represent the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service costs/credits will continue to be
 
allocated to each segment. Interest costs, expected return on assets, and MTM actuarial gains and losses will be included in corporate unallocated results. Management believes this allocation will better reflect the operating results of each of its reporting segments. See the accompanying financial schedules for adjusted segment income which show the effect of the accounting change on reported segment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, including selected quarterly information.
Certain exhibits to this Form 8-K include presentations of diluted earnings per share which excludes special items, as well as segment income. These are financial measures that are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP, but are included to provide additional useful measurements to review our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance.
Our presentations of diluted earnings per share which excludes special items should not be considered as alternatives to diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, segment income should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release certain reconciliation information for these measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
The text of the release announcing this change in accounting method is filed as Exhibit 99.7 to this Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.7
 
BATON ROUGE, LA, November 15, 2012  Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), a leader in the global specialty chemicals market, announced today that it plans to change its method of accounting for deferred actuarial gains and losses relating to its global pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans to a more preferable method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). This new accounting method, referred to as mark-to-market (MTM) accounting, will be adopted in the fourth quarter 2012 and will be retrospectively applied to the Company's financial results for all periods to be presented in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.
"We believe this accounting change will provide greater transparency to our operating results that will allow investors to more clearly evaluate the Company's underlying operating performance by recognizing actuarial gains and losses from our pension and OPEB plans in the year in which the gains and losses occur, rather than amortizing them over future periods," said Scott Tozier, Albemarle's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "This change will also improve transparency by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on pension and OPEB plan investments and assumptions in the year changes in these trends occur. This methodology is preferable under GAAP since it aligns more closely with fair value principles. Also, this accounting change has no impact on benefits received by participants of these plans or on the Company's related funding obligations."
Under MTM accounting, the Company's pre-tax pension and OPEB costs for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 would have been lower than previously reported by approximately $45 million. These lower costs would have resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle reports fourth quarter and full year 2012 results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA  January 22, 2013 
Fourth quarter 2012 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
See accompanying notes and reconciliations to the condensed consolidated financial information.
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings of $37.7 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $45.5 million, or $0.51 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2012 earnings were $105.2 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to $101.9 million, or $1.13 per share, for 2011. The Company reported net sales of $687.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to net sales of $707.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 with lower metals surcharges in the Catalysts segment more than offsetting total company volume growth.
Earnings for the full year 2012 were $311.5 million, or $3.47 per share, compared to $392.1 million, or $4.28 per share, for 2011. Excluding special items, earnings for 2012 were $436.2 million, or $4.85 per share, compared to $446.3 million, or $4.88 per share, for 2011. Net sales for 2012 were $2.7 billion compared to $2.9 billion for 2011 with the majority of the reduction caused by lower metals surcharges in the Catalysts segment.
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company adopted mark-to-market (MTM) accounting relating to its global pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. All historical
 
consolidated financial information presented herein has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change in accounting method. The MTM actuarial loss for 2012, recorded in Corporate and other expense, amounted to $75.8 million ($48.3 million after income taxes, or $0.54 per share) reflecting a lower assumed discount rate partially offset by 2012 pension asset performance.
Commenting on results, Luke Kissam, CEO, stated, "2012 was a difficult year from a macroeconomic standpoint, but we are pleased with the earnings power that we demonstrated in the face of a weak global economy, the negative impact of raw material pricing related to certain metals and lower demand than originally anticipated in many of the markets served by our products, resulting in lower operating rates at many of our production units. At the same time, we were able to exit the phosphorus business, freeze our pension obligations and further strengthen our balance sheet while also investing sufficient capital to permit future growth across our business portfolio."
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $294.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 2 percent increase over net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011, due mainly to favorable impacts from higher hydroprocessing and performance catalyst volumes, partially offset by lower metals surcharges in refinery catalysts and foreign currency. Catalysts segment income was $78.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down 6 percent from fourth quarter 2011 results of $84.2 million due primarily to unfavorable impacts from metals cost volatility versus the fourth quarter of 2011, partially offset by favorable sales volumes and higher equity income.
Polymer Solutions reported net sales of $200.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 4 percent decrease over net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011, due to the year-over-year effects of our phosphorus flame retardants business exit in the second quarter of 2012. Higher sales volumes in our core products were offset by unfavorable pricing, mix and foreign currency impacts. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $36.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 3 percent decline from $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, driven by unfavorable pricing, higher variable input costs including fixed cost absorption and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by favorable sales volumes and favorable impacts from our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $193.4 million, a 7 percent decrease versus net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011, due mainly to unfavorable pricing, lower volumes (mainly due to the timing of custom services contracts) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $35.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, down 19 percent from fourth quarter 2011 results of $43.8 million, due to unfavorable pricing, higher variable input costs including fixed cost absorption and impacts from higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partly offset by favorable sales mix.
 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $98.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease from the comparable period in 2011 was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs associated with performance-based incentive compensation levels and lower costs from non-operating pension and OPEB items which included a fourth quarter MTM actuarial loss of $86.0 million in 2012 and $92.3 million in 2011.
Interest and financing expenses were $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $9.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, with this decrease due primarily to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction project balances outstanding and lower variable-rate borrowings year-over-year.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 effective income tax rates were (45.6) percent and 22.0 percent, respectively. The fourth quarter rate was impacted primarily by the MTM actuarial loss. Excluding special items (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information), our fourth quarter and full year 2012 effective income tax rates were 18.3 percent and 24.5 percent, respectively.

On February 12, 2013, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the number of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase under its share repurchase program (the "Program"). The Board of Directors initially authorized the Program on October 25, 2000, permitting the Company to repurchase up to ten million shares. Since then, the Company has regularly repurchased shares under the Program, resulting in the Board of Directors periodically authorizing additional shares for repurchase. The most recent authorization permits the Company to repurchase up to fifteen million shares, including those shares previously authorized, but not yet repurchased. The Program will expire when the Company has repurchased all the shares authorized under the updated Program or if the Board of Directors earlier terminates the Program. Should the Company repurchase all or most of the shares currently authorized, the Board, in the future, may decide to authorize additional shares under the Program. The Company currently expects to repurchase approximately 10% of its outstanding shares over the next 10 to 15 months.
On February 12, 2013, the Company also announced an increase of its quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share of common stock, payable April 1, 2013.
The press release issued by the Company on February 12, 2013, announcing the increase in its share repurchase program and dividend increase, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
2013 Base Salaries
On February 22, 2013, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") established the following base salaries for named executive officers of Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") for fiscal year 2013: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($800,000); Karen G. Narwold ($400,000); Scott A. Tozier ($450,000); Matthew Juneau ($327,000); and Susan Kelliher ($358,000).
2013 Annual Incentive Plan
On February 22, 2013, the Committee approved the 2013 annual incentive plan target award percentages for the named executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of 0 to three times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Committee are met for 2013. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV (110%); Karen G. Narwold (60%); Scott A. Tozier (60%); Matthew Juneau (60%); and Susan Kelliher (60%). The named executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide metrics. For superior corporate performance, up to two times target may be earned. Further, based on specific individual performance goals, an additional amount may be earned up to the set maximum potential bonus. The maximum amounts payable for 2013 are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($2,640,000); Karen G. Narwold ($720,000); Scott A. Tozier ($810,000); Matthew Juneau ($589,000); and Susan Kelliher ($644,000). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2013, if EBITDA excluding special items exceeds 5% of Net Sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to the named executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the actual Company performance, individual performance, and award targets described above. The Committee bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. The Committee also established the annual incentive plan company-wide metrics for 2013 bonuses based on the following factors: EBIT (60%), days of working capital (15%), cash flow from operations (15%) and stewardship (10%), which includes metrics related to safety, the environment and sustainability. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2013 will be paid in the first quarter of 2014.
"EBIT" is combined income of each business segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the measurement period as determined by the Company for such purpose; provided, however, that in accordance with the Incentive Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
2013 Long Term Incentive Grant
On February 22, 2013, the Committee approved a total grant value of up to $19,000,000 for the 2013 long term incentive plan, comprised of: (i) Stock Options, which will vest in three equal installments over three years beginning on February 22, 2016, and which will expire February 21, 2023; (ii) Performance Stock Units ("PSUs") based on certain performance metrics; and (iii) Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") vesting on February 22, 2016. Each of the grants listed above will be awarded to certain employees of the Company, and are subject to the terms set forth in the form of Notice of Option Grant (Exhibit 10.1), Notice of Performance Unit Award (Exhibit 10.2) and Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (Exhibit 10.3), all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
Also on February 22, 2013, the Committee granted Stock Options and PSUs to the Company's named executive officers for 2013 under the Incentive Plan. The values granted to each named executive officer are included in the totals above, and are apportioned approximately 60% in the form of PSUs and approximately 40% in the form of Stock Options: Luther C. Kissam IV ($4,000,000); Karen G. Narwold ($600,000); Scott A Tozier ($800,000); Matthew Juneau ($500,000); and Susan Kelliher ($500,000). The value of PSUs included in the above figures reflects the approximate number of PSUs that each named executive officer would receive for target level performance by the Company multiplied by the grant date closing stock price.

The EBIT % of Target Units is determined according to the following table (awards to be interpolated between the dollar amounts and Trigger listed below):
EBIT % of Target Units.
 
"EBIT" is combined income of each segment before interest and taxes less corporate expenses before special items each calendar year in the Measurement Period as determined by the Company for such purpose provided, however, that in accordance with the Plan and as approved by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, EBIT may be adjusted to reflect extraordinary and significant events that distort current earnings.
"Cumulative EBIT" is EBIT for each calendar year in the Measurement Period added together.
"EBITDA" and "Net Sales" is the cumulative EBITDA and Net Sales for each calendar year in the Measurement Period.
For purposes of the above calculations, EBIT % of Target Units will be rounded to the nearest whole percent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Number of Units to be vested and paid = (QC/8) x (AP/TP) x Number of Target Units + ((8-QC)/8) x Number of Target Units
Where: QC = the number of completed calendar quarters of the performance period prior to a Change in Control.
AP = actual performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.
TP = target performance of the Company under the criteria for the Performance Units for the relevant period.
If a Change in Control occurs after the Measurement Period has been completed, but prior to the forfeiture of the Performance Units under paragraph 13, all earned Performance Units that are forfeitable shall become non-forfeitable as of the date of the Change in Control.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Albemarle reports first quarter 2013 results
 
 
BATON ROUGE, LA  April 17, 2013 
First quarter 2013 highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
See accompanying notes and reconciliations to the condensed consolidated financial information.
Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported first quarter 2013 earnings of $84.0 million, or $0.94 per share, compared to first quarter 2012 earnings of $114.3 million, or $1.27 per share. Excluding non-operating items, first quarter 2013 earnings were $82.7 million, or $0.93 per share, compared to $112.6 million, or $1.25 per share, for 2012. The Company reported net sales of $641.6 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to net sales of $711.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, driven by our exit from the phosphorus flame retardants business, lower metals surcharges and pricing on certain products.
"First quarter results matched our expectation that 2013 would begin the year slowly," stated Luke Kissam, CEO. "Catalysts was impacted by start-up costs from our two greenfield polyolefin catalysts expansions and an unfavorable mix in Refinery Catalysts. In Fine Chemistry, we saw robust demand for drilling fluids and an expected slow quarter in custom manufacturing. Polymer Solutions showed modest improvement from fourth quarter, but our current order book patterns suggest that demand for our portfolio of products in consumer electronics, construction and European auto markets will remain sluggish."
 
Quarterly Segment Results
Catalysts generated net sales of $235.5 million in the first quarter of 2013, a 20 percent decrease from net sales in the first quarter of 2012, due mainly to lower metals surcharges, unfavorable mix and lower overall volumes. Catalysts segment income was $57.0 million in the first quarter of 2013, down 32 percent from first quarter 2012 results of $83.4 million, due primarily to lower metals surcharges and volumes and unfavorable mix.
Polymer Solutions reported net sales of $214.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, a 6 percent decrease from net sales in the first quarter of 2012, due to the year-over-year effects of our phosphorus flame retardants business exit in the second quarter of 2012. Higher sales volumes in our core products were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable mix. Segment income for Polymer Solutions was $45.3 million in the first quarter of 2013, an 18 percent decline from $55.4 million in the first quarter of 2012, driven by lower pricing, higher variable input costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by favorable sales volumes and favorable impacts from our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business.
Fine Chemistry net sales in the first quarter of 2013 were $191.3 million, a 1 percent increase over net sales in the first quarter of 2012, due mainly to favorable sales volume partly offset by unfavorable pricing impacts. Segment income for Fine Chemistry was $31.4 million for the first quarter of 2013, down 24 percent from first quarter 2012 results of $41.0 million, due to unfavorable pricing, lower factory operating rates and timing of custom services projects.
 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other expense was $14.0 million ($16.1 million excluding non-operating items) for the first quarter of 2013. The $3.6 million decrease from the comparable period in 2012 was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs and other spending.
Interest and financing expenses were $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2012, with this decrease due primarily to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction project balances outstanding and lower variable-rate borrowings year-over-year.
Excluding non-operating items (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information), our effective income tax rates were 24.6 percent and 26.0 percent for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Cash Flow
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $99 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, and we had $435 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2013. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of approximately $55 million (which includes approximately $19 million in capital expenditures associated with our Jordanian joint venture), dividends to shareholders of $17.8 million and repurchases of $60.8 million, or approximately 1.0 million shares, of our common stock.
Earnings Call
The Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight time on April 18, 2013.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information
 
 
Although non-operating pension and OPEB items are included in our GAAP operating profit, we believe that these components of pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses.

(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company).

The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting.

In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting, and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 9, 2013, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Master Confirmation (the "ASR Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as agent for JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch ("JPMorgan") relating to an uncollared accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR Program"). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $450 million of its common stock from JPMorgan. The Company will acquire the shares under the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Company's board of directors, allowing for the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock, the increase in which was previously announced on February 12, 2013. The purchases will be funded through a combination of available cash on hand and debt.
The total number of shares to ultimately be purchased by the Company under the ASR Program will generally be based on the average of the daily Rule 10b-18 volume-weighted average prices of the Company's common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. The actual number of shares purchased will be determined at the completion of the ASR Program. The ASR Program is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the ASR Agreement. A copy of the ASR Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
In order to fund part of its obligations under the ASR Agreement, the Company submitted a draw down notice to borrow approximately $300 million under its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2011, among the Company and Albemarle Global Finance Company SCA, as borrowers, the several banks and other financial institutions parties thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Credit Facility"). The terms of the Credit Facility, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 22, 2011, are incorporated herein by reference.
The Company also intends to borrow funds under an uncommitted credit line providing for borrowings up to a maximum of $30 million. The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 75 basis points. Such indebtedness is subject to customary events of default such as defaults for insolvency, nonperformance of covenants and nonpayment.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

On May 29, 2013, Albemarle Corporation (the "Company") entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program (the "Program") on a private placement basis under which the Company may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of up to $750 million. The proceeds of the issuance of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The Company's revolving credit agreement is available to repay the Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowing under the revolving credit agreement and the Program will not exceed the $750 million current maximum amount available under the revolving credit agreement.
The maturities of the Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The principal amount of outstanding Notes under the Program may not exceed $750 million. The Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of the issuance of the Notes. The definitive documents relating to the Program provide the terms under which the dealers participating in the Program will either purchase from the Company or arrange for the sale by the Company of Notes pursuant to an exemption from federal and state securities laws. The definitive documents relating to the Program contain customary representations, warranties, covenants, defaults and indemnification provisions.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
