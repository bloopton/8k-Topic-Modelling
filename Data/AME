Exhibit 99(a) [AMETEK NEWS LOGO] Contact: William J. Burke (610) 889-5249 AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FULL-YEAR RESULTS -- FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS UP SHARPLY ON HIGHER SALES -- Paoli, PA, January 28, 2003 -- AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced full year results that established records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. AMETEK achieved 2002 sales of $1.04 billion, up 2% from year 2001 results. Operating income of $148.7 million was up 12% from $132.8 million for 2001. Income grew to $83.7 million, up 18% from the $70.8 million earned in 2001, and diluted earnings per share of $2.49 were up from $2.12 per share in 2001. All comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are before unusual items in the fourth quarter of 2001 described below. Including these unusual items, net income for 2001 was $66.1 million, or $1.98 per diluted share. "AMETEK performed extremely well in 2002," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Contributions from businesses we acquired and from our operational excellence initiatives allowed us to post top and bottom line growth in a very difficult economic environment," he commented. "In addition, we substantially reduced our working capital during 2002 due to an excellent effort across the Company," added Mr. Hermance. "Inventory and receivables were down $29 million, exceeding the $20 million reduction we targeted. We used the cash generated to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, which on an after tax basis, reduced operating cash flow by approximately $19 million." FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS AMETEK's fourth quarter 2002 sales of $252.6 million were up 6% over the same period of 2001. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $36.5 million, a 28% increase from the $28.6 million recorded in the same period of 2001. Income in the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $21.3 million, or $.63 per diluted share, up from fourth quarter 2001 levels of $16.2 million, or $.48 per diluted share. After unusual items, net income for the fourth quarter of 2001 was $11.5 million, or $.34 per diluted share. On January 1, 2002 AMETEK adopted SFAS #142, which eliminated amortization of goodwill. The impact of the amortization of goodwill in AMETEK's 2001 fourth quarter results was $.08 per diluted share and $.30 per diluted share for the full year 2001. Fourth quarter 2001 net income reflected expenses totaling $15.3 million after tax, or $.46 per diluted share, to cover the costs of employee reductions, facility closures, and asset writedowns. Also in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $10.5 million, or $.32 per diluted share, resulting from the closure of a number of tax years.
-MORE- AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FULL-YEAR RESULTS PAGE 2. 2003 OUTLOOK Mr. Hermance commented, "We expect that 2003 will be another challenging year, and we are not anticipating significant improvement from the current economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. "We expect revenues to be up modestly with earnings in the range of $2.65 - $2.75 per diluted share, an increase of 6% to 10% over 2002. This estimate includes the positive impact of our recent acquisition of Airtechnology and approximately $7 million pretax, or $.14 per diluted share, of additional pension expense. Without the additional pension expense, our earnings would be up approximately 12% to 16% versus 2002." "Our first quarter 2003 sales are expected to be down slightly from last year's first quarter, as the top-line benefits of the Airtechnology acquisition are offset by weaker aerospace, power and heavy vehicle markets. We expect our earnings to be about equal to last year's level of $.59 per diluted share after the additional pension expense. Without the additional pension expense, earnings would be up approximately 6%," concluded Mr. Hermance. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT GROUPS (EIG) For 2002, EIG sales of $539.4 million were up 8% from 2001 sales of $499.5 million. Operating income was $87.5 million for 2002, up 26% versus $69.5 million earned in 2001. Operating margins were 16.2% in 2002, up from 13.9% in 2001. For the 2002 fourth quarter, EIG sales increased 7% to $132.6 million. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $23.0 million, compared with $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 17.4%, from 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2001. "Instruments for Research and Applied Science (IRAS) and EDAX, both acquired in 2001, were solid contributors to EIG's growth in revenue and profit during 2002. Operational excellence initiatives throughout the Group were also instrumental in driving margin growth," said Mr. Hermance. ELECTROMECHANICAL GROUP (EMG) For the year, EMG's sales decreased 4% to $501.1 million, compared with $519.8 million in 2001. Operating income was $80.2 million for 2002, down 1% from the $81.3 million earned in 2001. Operating margins increased to 16.0% in 2002 from 15.6% in 2001. For the fourth quarter of 2002, EMG's sales were $120.0 million, a 6% increase over the same period of 2001. Operating income of $18.2 million is down 3% from the $18.7 million recorded in the same period of 2001. Operating margins for the quarter were 15.2% compared with 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2001. "Market conditions remain difficult for EMG. The top-line benefits of our 2001 acquisition of GS Electric were more than offset by weak sales in several other markets. The continued execution of our operational excellence and best-cost initiatives resulted in the increased margins for the group in 2002," noted Mr. Hermance. -MORE-
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FULL-YEAR RESULTS PAGE 3. ACQUISITION OF AIRTECHNOLOGY GROUP On January 13, 2003 AMETEK completed the acquisition of Airtechnology Holdings Limited, a leading supplier of motors, fans and environmental control systems for aerospace and defense markets, from Candover Partners Limited. Airtechnology, located near London, England, has about 240 employees and expected sales of approximately L29 million ($46 million). "We are very excited about our acquisition of Airtechnology. It significantly expands our presence in high-end technical motors and strengthens our relationships with large European-based aerospace and defense companies," commented Mr. Hermance. Airtechnology produces motors and fans for equipment cooling systems and for maintaining environmental integrity. Environmental integrity includes temperature control systems as well as filtration systems for nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) contamination. These products are sold primarily to the military aerospace, vehicle and ship markets. Other markets include commercial aerospace and rail vehicles. "Airtechnology is a recognized market leader in air-moving components and environmental systems used in many high profile European defense and commercial aerospace programs," he added. "The combination of AMETEK Rotron and Airtechnology provides us with a broader range of products that we can market to our customers on a global basis."

EXHIBIT 99(a) [AMETEK NEWS LETTERHEAD] AMETEK ACQUIRES SOLIDSTATE CONTROLS, INC. ACQUISITION BROADENS AMETEK'S PRODUCT OFFERING TO THE PROCESS AND POWER INDUSTRIES Paoli, PA, March 5, 2003 -- AMETEK, Inc.

With its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, Solidstate Controls has approximately 250 employees and estimated 2003 sales of $45 million. "We are very pleased with our acquisition of Solidstate Controls," comments AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank S. Hermance.

Both are markets in which AMETEK already is a key player. Together with its strong global sales and service capabilities, Solidstate Controls is a great addition to AMETEK." Solidstate Controls designs and manufactures highly customized inverters and UPS systems that its customers use to ensure a steady supply of clean power to keep their critical processes functioning properly. These critical processes typically involve harsh environments and have a correspondingly high cost of failure.

Solidstate Controls joins AMETEK as part of its Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) -- a recognized leader in advanced monitoring, testing, calibrating and display instruments. AMETEK EIG sells its instruments to the process, aerospace, power, and industrial markets worldwide and had 2002 sales of approximately $540 million.

Burke (610) 889-5249 AMETEK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS -- REAFFIRMS 2003 EARNINGS FORECAST -- Paoli, PA, April 22, 2003 -- AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced that its overall results for the first quarter are in line with its expectations. First quarter 2003 sales of $267.5 million were up 2% from the $263.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2002. Operating income for the first quarter of 2003 was $36.7 million up 1% from the first quarter of 2002. Net income was $19.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $.59, both essentially unchanged from last year's first quarter levels. Cash flow from operations was excellent, increasing to nearly $26 million in the first quarter, up from $9 million in last year's first quarter. Working capital management was the largest contributor to this increase. "We are very pleased with our first quarter performance given the weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. Our profitability met our expectations and reflects continued solid execution of our four growth strategies," commented Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Operational excellence initiatives, including movement of manufacturing to low-cost locales, continue to provide excellent results. We are also very pleased with the recent acquisitions of Airtechnology and Solidstate Controls. Both are highly differentiated companies that contributed to our solid performance in the first quarter," he added. ELECTROMECHANICAL GROUP (EMG) EMG's sales of $133.9 million were up 6% from $126.8 million in the first quarter of 2002. First quarter group operating income of $21.8 million also was up 6%, compared with the $20.6 million reported for the same period of 2002. EMG's operating income margin in the first quarter of 2003 increased to 16.3% from 16.2% in the first quarter of 2002. "EMG had a good first quarter. The revenue increase was driven by the acquisition of Airtechnology. The performance of our floorcare business was up slightly, with strong performance in Europe and weak performance in the United States," added Mr. Hermance. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS GROUP (EIG) EIG first quarter 2003 sales were $133.6 million, down 2% from last year's level of $136.8 million. First quarter group operating income was down 5% to $20.0 million, versus $21.0 million in the same period of 2002. Group operating margins were 15.0%, down from 15.3% in the first quarter of 2002. "Our revenues were positively impacted by strong performance in our high-end analytical instrumentation businesses and the acquisition of Solidstate Controls, while our aerospace and power businesses were much weaker than a year ago," noted Mr. Hermance.
EXHIBIT 99(a) --MORE-- AMETEK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 2. OUTLOOK "For the balance of the year, market conditions are expected to remain weak for many of our businesses, particularly aerospace and power. As in the past, we are managing the cost structure of the company very closely and making adjustments where required. We are reaffirming our full-year forecast of modest revenue growth with diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share," he added.

Our most recent acquisitions - Airtechnology and Solidstate Controls - drove our sales increase in the quarter, and our strong operational excellence results contributed to our record earnings," he noted. For the first half of 2003, AMETEK sales increased 3% to $544.4 million from $531.0 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income totaled $75.4 million, a 2% increase from $74.1 million earned in the first half of last year. Net income for the first half of 2003 was $41.5 million, up 1% from $41.0 million in the same period of 2002. Diluted earnings per share were up 2% to $1.24 for the first half of 2003. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS GROUP (EIG) EIG's second quarter 2003 sales were $137.4 million, up 2% from last year's level of $135.3 million. Second quarter group operating income was up 6% to $21.9 million, versus $20.7 million in the same period of 2002. Group operating margins were 15.9%, up from 15.3% in the second quarter of 2002. "EIG had a great quarter in a very difficult economic environment," noted Mr. Hermance. "Revenue for the group was up, driven by the acquisition of Solidstate Controls earlier this year. Our aerospace and power businesses remain weak when compared with a year ago, but their results were in line with our expectations. Profitability was up nicely as our cost reduction activities continue to provide excellent results." --MORE--
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD RESULTS PAGE 2. ELECTROMECHANICAL GROUP (EMG) EMG's sales of $139.5 million were up 6% from $132.1 million in the second quarter of 2002. Second quarter group operating income of $21.7 million was down slightly, as compared with the $21.9 million reported for the same period of 2002. EMG's operating income margin in the second quarter of 2003 was 15.5%, down from a difficult comparison of 16.5% in the second quarter of 2002. "Group revenues were up on the contribution from Airtechnology, acquired in the first quarter of this year. The trends that affected our core businesses in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. Our European floor care motor business was strong, while our domestic floor care business remained weak. Operating margin was negatively impacted by severance costs, higher than anticipated benefit costs, and weakness in the U.S. floor care market," added Mr. Hermance. OUTLOOK "For the balance of 2003, we are not expecting market conditions for our businesses to improve. We continue to aggressively manage our cost structure to the realities of the economic environment and are poised to take advantage of an economic rebound when it does occur. For the full year, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth with diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.65 to $2.70 per share," concluded Mr. Hermance.

EXHIBIT 99(a) [AMETEK LETTERHEAD] Contact: William J. Burke (610) 889-5249 AMETEK ANNOUNCES VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK Paoli, PA, August 19, 2003 -- AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced that restricted stock granted to Frank Hermance, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has vested. On December 15, 2000, with its stock price at $24.50, AMETEK's Board of Directors granted 150,000 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Hermance. In accordance with the terms of that grant, this stock vested today as a result of AMETEK's stock price closing at or above $40 per share for five consecutive trading days. Vesting of the restricted stock accelerates recognition of the associated deferred compensation expense. As a result of this non-cash expense, third quarter net income will be reduced by $2.1 million, or $.06 per diluted share. Due to the uncertain timing of this event and its one-time nature, this expense has not been included in any of the Company's previous guidance for the quarter or the full year. Including this one-time expense, the Company now expects to earn $.64 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2003, down from its previous guidance of $.70 per diluted share. CORPORATE PROFILE AMETEK IS A LEADING GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRIC MOTORS WITH 2002 SALES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION. AMETEK'S CORPORATE GROWTH PLAN IS BASED ON FOUR KEY STRATEGIES: STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS & ALLIANCES, GLOBAL & MARKET EXPANSION, NEW PRODUCTS, AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE.

Burke (610) 889-5249 AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD EARNINGS -- CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS UP 35%-- Paoli, PA, October 20, 2003 -- AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced strong third quarter results that established records for operating income and net income. AMETEK's operating income for the third quarter of 2003 was $39.5 million, up 4% from the third quarter of 2002. Net income of $21.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.65 are up 2% from year-ago levels. Third quarter 2003 sales of $267.8 million were up 4% from the $257.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2002. This year's third quarter earnings include a one-time, non-cash expense of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, reflecting the accelerated recognition of deferred compensation expense related to the vesting of restricted stock granted to the Company's chairman and chief executive officer. Excluding this expense, operating income would have been $41.6 million, up 9% over the third quarter of 2002. Similarly, earnings would have increased 12% to $24.0 million and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.71, up 11% over the same period of last year. The Company continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $31.8 million in this year's third quarter and $108.1 million for the first nine months of 2003, each up 35% over the same period of 2002. "AMETEK achieved solid results during the third quarter, despite what continues to be a challenging economic environment for manufacturers," commented Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our revenue growth was driven by the recent acquisitions of Airtechnology Holdings, Solidstate Controls and Chandler Instruments, all of which were completed in 2003. These acquisitions and operational excellence improvements across the Company drove our record earnings performance." For the first nine months of 2003, AMETEK sales increased 3% to $812.2 million from $788.0 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income totaled $114.9 million, a 2% increase from $112.2 million earned in the first nine months of last year. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $63.5 million, up 2% from $62.4 million in the same period of 2002. Diluted earnings per share were up 1% to $1.88 for the first nine months of 2003. Excluding the compensation expense noted above, operating income for the first nine months of 2003 would have totaled $117.0 million, up 4% over the same period of 2002. Similarly, earnings would have been up 5% to $65.6 million and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.95, also up 5% from the same period of 2002.
EXHIBIT 99(a) --MORE-- AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD EARNINGS PAGE 2. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS GROUP (EIG) EIG's third quarter 2003 sales were $139.0 million, up 3% from last year's level of $134.7 million. Third quarter group operating income of $24.9 million, was up 9% versus $22.8 million in the same period of 2002. Group operating margins were 17.9%, up from 16.9% recorded in the third quarter of 2002. "EIG had a great quarter," added Mr. Hermance. "Revenue for the group was up, driven by the Solidstate Controls and Chandler Instruments acquisitions. Margins expanded as a result of improved profitability in our aerospace and power businesses despite the significant market downturn, as well as the impact of operational excellence activities throughout the Group." ELECTROMECHANICAL GROUP (EMG) EMG's sales of $128.8 million were up 5% from $122.3 million in the third quarter of 2002. Third quarter group operating income of $21.6 million was up 11%, compared with the $19.5 million reported for the same period of 2002. EMG's operating margin in the third quarter of 2003 was 16.8%, up from 16.0% in the third quarter of 2002. "EMG also had a great quarter. Revenues benefited from the contribution of Airtechnology, acquired during the first quarter. Our European motor businesses continue to perform well, while our U.S. floor care and specialty motor businesses are weak. Operating margins were up on strength in our differentiated technical motor platform. Both our core Rotron motor business and the recently acquired Airtechnology business performed well in the quarter," added Mr. Hermance. OUTLOOK "Many macroeconomic indicators point to an improving economy, however we have not yet seen our business levels increase. While we are poised to capitalize on an economic recovery when it occurs, we continue to closely manage our cost structure. For the full year 2003, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth with diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.60," concluded Mr. Hermance. ACQUISITION OF CHANDLER INSTRUMENTS Effective August 28, 2003, AMETEK acquired Chandler Instruments Company, LLC, a leading manufacturer of high-quality measurement instrumentation for the oil and gas industry, for approximately $50 million. With its headquarters in Tulsa, OK, Chandler has annual sales of approximately $30 million.

The Company also announced several significant changes including a stock split, dividend increase and the expanded use of restricted stock as part of its long-term compensation structure. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS AMETEK's fourth quarter 2003 sales of $279.4 million were up 11% over the same period of 2002. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $41.9 million, a 15% increase from the $36.5 million recorded in the same period of 2002. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 14% to $24.4 million, or $.71 per diluted share, from fourth quarter 2002 levels of $21.3 million, or $.63 per diluted share. Sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share were quarterly records. FULL-YEAR RESULTS AMETEK achieved 2003 sales of $1.09 billion, up 5% from year 2002 results.

Earnings are expected to be approximately $2.90 to $3.00 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 12% to 15% over 2003 driven by strength in our differentiated businesses, our continued focus on operational excellence, including movement of additional manufacturing to low cost locales, and contributions from our 2003 acquisitions. -MORE-

We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.66 - $0.68 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 12% to 15% over last year's first quarter," concluded Mr. Hermance. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT GROUPS (EIG) For the 2003 fourth quarter, EIG sales increased 15% to $151.9 million. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $28.2 million, compared with $23.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of 22%. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 18.6%, from 17.4% in the fourth quarter of 2002. "EIG sales were up in the quarter as the contribution from the acquisitions of Solidstate Controls and Chandler Instruments and internal growth in our high-end analytical instruments business more than overcame lower aerospace and power instrument sales. EIG margins were up 120 basis points as contributions from the acquisitions and broad-based operating improvements combined for these very impressive results," said Mr. Hermance. For the year, EIG sales of $561.9 million were up 4% from 2002 sales of $539.4 million. Operating income was $95.0 million for 2003, up 9% versus $87.5 million earned in 2002. Operating margins were 16.9% in 2003, up from 16.2% in 2002. ELECTROMECHANICAL GROUP (EMG) For the fourth quarter of 2003, EMG's sales were $127.5 million, a 6% increase over the same period of 2002. Operating income of $19.0 million was up 4% from the $18.2 million recorded in the same period of 2002. Operating margins for the quarter were 14.9%, compared with 15.2% in the fourth quarter of 2002. "EMG fourth quarter sales were up as the contribution from Airtechnology, acquired earlier in 2003, overcame lower sales of cost-driven motors. Operating margins were solid, driven by the benefits of the Airtechnology acquisition and other operational improvements," noted Mr. Hermance. For the year, EMG's sales increased 6% to $529.7 million, compared with $501.1 million in 2002. Operating income was $84.2 million for 2003, up 5% from the $80.2 million earned in 2002. Operating margins were essentially unchanged at 15.9% in 2003, compared with 16.0% in 2002. TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT SET The Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of its common stock, payable on February 27, 2004, to shareholders of record on February 13, 2004. By splitting its stock, AMETEK expects to broaden the stock's marketability and improve its trading liquidity. Unless otherwise indicated, all share and per share information in this report is presented on a pre-split basis. The Company's Form 10-K for 2003 will be prepared on a post-split basis. DIVIDEND INCREASED 100% After reviewing the Company's financial position, cash flow and earnings history, and future expectations, AMETEK's Board of Directors also has decided to increase the quarterly common stock dividend 100%, to an indicated annual rate of $.24 per share on a post-split basis ($.48 per share on a pre-split basis). The Board of Directors declared the first quarter dividend of $.06 per share ($.12 on a pre-split basis), payable on March 26, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2004. -MORE-
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS PAGE 3. Mr. Hermance commented, "Our Four Growth Strategies have resulted in significant increases in sales, profitability and cash flow in the last several years. Anticipated strong future cash flows will enable us to continue to fund our growth strategies while rewarding shareholders with a higher cash dividend." LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN CHANGE The Company has adopted a change in the composition of its long-term compensation plan. Beginning in 2004, the long-term incentive plan for officers of the Company and other senior management personnel will be composed of 50% restricted stock and 50% stock options, rather than all stock options as it had been previously. This change will result in AMETEK expensing approximately half of its future long-term compensation awards. The Company believes this new plan will enhance AMETEK's ability to attract and retain management talent.

(AMETEK LETTERHEAD) Contact: William J. Burke (610) 889-5249 AMETEK ACQUIRES TAYLOR HOBSON HOLDINGS LIMITED ACQUISITION EXPANDS AMETEK'S HIGH-END ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENT PLATFORM Paoli, PA, June 21, 2004 -- AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced the acquisition of Taylor Hobson Holdings Limited (`Taylor Hobson'), a leading manufacturer of ultra-precision measurement instrumentation for a variety of markets, including optics, semiconductors, hard disk drives and nanotechnology research. Taylor Hobson was acquired from funds advised by Permira for a purchase price of approximately 51 million British pound sterling. With its headquarters in Leicester, England, Taylor Hobson has expected 2004 sales of approximately 38 million British pound sterling. "We are very excited about our acquisition of Taylor Hobson," comments AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank S. Hermance. "This is a highly differentiated business, focusing on the most complex and critical measurements for its customers. Taylor Hobson significantly expands our measurement capabilities into ultra-precision applications and is an excellent fit with our strategic focus on adding more high-end analytical instrument businesses. With this acquisition, our high-end analytical businesses now total more than $250 million in annual revenue." "Taylor Hobson's instrumentation is able to measure the shape and finish of surfaces to the sub-nanometer level. This measurement capability is a critical enabling technology to support product development, manufacturing process engineering and quality control. As product geometries continue to shrink, Taylor Hobson's instrumentation becomes even more important," adds Mr. Hermance. Taylor Hobson designs, manufactures, and services a broad array of contact and non-contact instrumentation for ultra-precise measurement applications. These instruments measure surface texture, shape and roundness, dimensions that are critical in many industries including optics, semiconductor, hard disk drive, automotive and bearing manufacturing. Nanotechnology is becoming an increasingly important market for Taylor Hobson's technology and represents AMETEK's first entry into this exciting area. Taylor Hobson has long been a technology leader by providing standard setting ultra-precision contact measurement systems. More recently, Taylor Hobson has introduced new products based on non-contact optical technology, including the Coherence Correlation Interferometer (CCI). This product sets new standards in three-dimensional surface analysis with measurement resolution at the sub-nanometer level. Taylor Hobson joins AMETEK as part of its Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) --a recognized leader in advanced monitoring, testing, calibrating and display instruments. AMETEK EIG sells its instruments to the process, aerospace, power, and industrial markets worldwide and had 2003 sales of approximately $560 million. MORE

Earnings are expected to be approximately $1.54 to $1.58 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 18% to 22% over 2003." "Our third quarter 2004 sales are expected to be up low double-digits from last year's third quarter on internal growth in both segments and the contribution from the Taylor Hobson, Hughes-Treitler and Chandler Instruments acquisitions. We expect our earnings to be approximately $.38 to $.40 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 19% to 25% over last year's third quarter," concluded Mr. Hermance. AMETEK COMPLETES TWO ACQUISITIONS On July 16, 2004, AMETEK completed the acquisition of the assets of HUGHES-TREITLER MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, a privately held supplier of heat exchangers and thermal management subsystems for the aerospace and defense markets. Hughes-Treitler, located in Garden City, NY, has expected annual sales of approximately $32 million. The purchase price is approximately $48 million in cash. "We are very excited about the acquisition of Hughes-Treitler," commented Mr. Hermance. "It significantly expands our thermal management product offering to the military and commercial aerospace markets. Hughes-Treitler provides complementary products and serves a number of customers common to our other aerospace and defense businesses. Together with our Rotron and Airtechnology business units, Hughes-Treitler enables AMETEK to provide a broader range of thermal management subsystems to our customers on a global basis." Hughes-Treitler is a recognized market leader in heat exchangers and other subsystems designed for equipment cooling or maintaining environmental integrity in the commercial and military aerospace industries. Products include air-oil coolers, air-air coolers, surface coolers, ECS evaporator condensers, fuel oil coolers, liquid air heat exchangers, liquid oxygen heat exchangers, and buffer air heat exchangers. These products are used in a variety of applications for airframes, engine and avionics systems on aircraft as well as in military vehicle, marine, space and industrial applications. On June 18, 2004, AMETEK completed the acquisition of TAYLOR HOBSON HOLDINGS LIMITED (`Taylor Hobson'), a leading manufacturer of ultra-precision measurement instrumentation for a variety of markets, including optics, semiconductors, hard disk drives and nanotechnology research. Taylor Hobson was acquired from funds advised by Permira for a purchase price of approximately 51 million British pound sterling ($94 million), net of cash received. With its headquarters in Leicester, England, Taylor Hobson has expected 2004 sales of approximately 38 million British pound sterling ($70 million). --MORE--
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD RESULTS PAGE 3. "We are pleased with our acquisition of Taylor Hobson," commented Mr. Hermance. "This is a highly differentiated business, focusing on the most complex and critical measurements for its customers. Taylor Hobson significantly expands our measurement capabilities into ultra-precision applications and is an excellent fit with our strategic focus on adding more high-end analytical instrument businesses. With this acquisition, our high-end analytical instrument businesses now total more than $250 million in annual revenue." "Taylor Hobson's instrumentation is able to measure the shape and finish of surfaces to the sub-nanometer level. This measurement capability is a critical enabling technology to support product development, manufacturing process engineering and quality control. As product geometries continue to shrink, Taylor Hobson's instrumentation becomes even more important," adds Mr. Hermance. Taylor Hobson designs, manufactures and services a broad array of contact and non-contact instrumentation for ultra-precise measurement applications. These instruments measure surface texture, shape and roundness, dimensions that are critical in many industries including optics, semiconductor, hard disk drive, automotive and bearing manufacturing. Nanotechnology is becoming an increasingly important market for Taylor Hobson's technology and represents AMETEK's first entry into this exciting area.

EXHIBIT 99(a)
Contact: William J. Burke (610) 889-5249
Paoli, PA, April 20, 2005  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced first quarter results that established records for sales, operating income, and net income.
AMETEK's first quarter 2005 sales of $334.1 million were up 15% over the same period of 2004. Operating income for the first quarter of 2005 was $55.0 million, a 27% increase from the $43.5 million recorded in the same period of 2004. Net income in the first quarter of 2005 increased 30% to $32.0 million, or $.46 per diluted share, from the first quarter 2004 level of $24.7 million, or $.36 per diluted share. Sales, operating income, and net income were quarterly records.
"AMETEK had an excellent quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong internal growth in both our Electronic Instruments and Electromechanical segments combined with the contributions from businesses acquired last year enabled us to grow the top-line by 15%. Operating income was up 27% as we captured the leverage in our business model," he commented.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
For the 2005 first quarter, EIG sales increased 20% to $180.9 million. Operating income was $36.9 million, compared with $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 41%. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 20.4%, from 17.3% in the first quarter of 2004.
"EIG sales were up in the quarter on strong core growth in our aerospace, industrial, and process and analytical businesses and the contribution from the 2004 acquisition of Taylor Hobson. Operating income was up 41%, benefiting from the top line growth and continued focus on operational excellence improvements," said Mr. Hermance.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
For the first quarter of 2005, EMG sales were $153.2 million, a 9% increase over the same period of 2004 driven by strong core growth and the 2004 acquisition of Hughes-Treitler. Operating income of $24.7 million was up 6% from the $23.3 million recorded in the same period of 2004. Operating margins for the quarter were 16.1%, compared with 16.6% in the first quarter of 2004. This margin decline was due to shipment delays on several high margin military aerospace programs. We expect to ship these products over the balance of the year.
 
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FIRST QUARTER WITH NET INCOME UP 30% Page 2
2005 Outlook
"For 2005 we expect revenues to be up approximately 10% on solid internal growth in each of our two groups and the full-year benefits from our Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler acquisitions," commented Mr. Hermance. "Based on our first quarter performance we are raising our earnings estimates. We now expect 2005 earnings to be approximately $1.90 to $1.97 per diluted share, an increase of 17% to 21% over 2004, driven by the top-line growth and our continued focus on operational excellence, including the movement of additional manufacturing to low-cost locales."
"Our second quarter 2005 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% to 15% from last year's second quarter on internal growth in both segments and the contribution from our 2004 acquisitions of Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler. We expect our earnings to be approximately $.46 to $.48 per diluted share, an increase of 15% to 20% over last year's second quarter," concluded Mr. Hermance.

At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 26, 2005, the proposed amendment to the Plan was approved by the stockholders and became effective on that date. Currently, a maximum of 4,000,000 shares may be granted under the 2002 Plan. As of March 31, 2005, 1,7 29,180 shares had been granted and 2,270,820 shares remained available for grant. A copy of the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan of AMETEK, Inc., as amended, is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 On April 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted 350,000 shares of restricted stock to Frank S. Hermance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company under the 2002 Plan, as amended. These shares will vest on the earliest to occur of (a) April 26, 2011, provided Mr. Hermance has been in the continuous employ of AMETEK through that date, (b) the death or disability of Mr. Hermance, (c) the termination of Mr. Hermance's employment by the Company without cause, (d) a "Change in Control" (as defined), or (e) the closing price of AMETEK's common stock on any five consecutive trading days equaling or exceeding $75.16 per share. A copy of the Restricted Stock Agreement with Mr. Hermance is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
The Company has decided that it will not begin expensing stock options as of July 1, 2005, the date that would have been required for the Company by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment". Instead, AMETEK will take advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commissions April 14, 2005 guidelines, which amended the FASB compliance date for expensing employee stock options to January 1, 2006 for the Company. During AMETEKs first quarter 2005 earnings teleconference/webcast on April 20, 2005, Frank S. Hermance, AMETEKs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that at that time the Company was still considering if it would expense stock options as of July 1, 2005, although not required to do so until January 1, 2006. The 2005 expense for adopting Statement No. 123(R) as of July 1, 2005 was reflected in AMETEK's full-year 2005 earnings guidance, which it gave in its first quarter 2005 earnings announcement on April 20, 2005. For 2 005, the effect on net income of recognizing the nondeductible expense associated with the Restricted Stock Agreement discussed in Item 1.01 above is approximately equal to the after tax expense saving from the delay in expensing stock options until January 1, 2006, previously noted.

Top of the Form
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Top of the Form

1. . The purpose of this Stock Incentive Plan is to advance the interests of the Corporation by encouraging and enabling the acquisition of a larger personal proprietary interest in the Corporation by key employees and Directors of the Corporation and its Affiliates upon whose judgment and keen interest the Corporation is largely dependent for the successful conduct of its operations, and by providing such key employees and Directors with incentives to maximize the success of the Corporation. It is anticipated that the acquisition of such proprietary interest in the Corporation and such incentives will strengthen the desire of such key employees and Directors to remain with the Corporation as well as that such incentives and the opportunity to acquire such a proprietary interest will enable the Corporation and its Affiliates to attract desirable personnel and Directors.
Purpose
2. . When used in this Plan, unless the context otherwise requires:
Definitions
(a) "Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
(e) "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
(g) "Corporation" shall mean AMETEK, Inc.
(q) "Plan" shall mean the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan of AMETEK, Inc.
(u) "Share" shall mean a share of common stock of the Corporation.
3. . Subject to the provisions of Section 16 hereof, the aggregate number of Shares that may be subject to Options, Phantom Stock Awards (other than any Phantom Stock Awards which are payable only in cash), Restricted Stock Awards and Rights shall not exceed 4,000,000, which Shares may be either Treasury Shares or authorized but unissued Shares. A maximum of 1,400,000 Shares may be awarded to any single individual during the duration of the Plan. A maximum of 30% of the aggregate number of Shares, or 1,200,000 Shares, may be awarded as Restricted Shares, Rights, Phantom Stock Awards and Phantom Stock Units. A maximum of 10% of the aggregate number of Shares, or 400,000 Shares, may be awarded to Non-Employee Directors during the duration of the Plan. In the event the Corporation adopts a stock purchase plan for the benefit of its employees, the shares of common stock awarded under that plan shall further reduce the aggregate number of Shares available under this Plan. If the Shares that would be issued or transferred pursuant to any such Incentive Award are not issued or transferred and cease to be issuable or transferable for any reason (including the extent to which payment pursuant to a Phantom Stock Award is made in cash), or if Restricted Shares issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award are forfeited, the number of Shares subject to such Incentive Award will no longer be charged against the limitation provided for herein (even if the holders had voting or dividend rights with regard to the Shares) and may again be made subject to Incentive Awards; provided, however, that Shares as to which an Option has been surrendered in connection with the exercise of a related Right shall not again be available for the grant of any further Incentive Awards. Notwithstanding the preceding, with respect to any Option or Right granted to any person who is a "covered employee" as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code that is canceled (other than with respect to the exercise of a related Right or Option) or as to which the exercise price or base value is reduced, the number of shares subject to such Option or Right shall continue to be counted, in accordance with said Section 162(m) and regulations promulgated thereunder, against the maximum number of Shares which may be the subject of Incentive Awards granted to such person.
Shares Subject to the Plan
4. . The Plan shall be administered by a Committee which shall consist of at least two Directors, all of whom shall be "outside directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code and related Treasury regulations and all of whom shall be "Non-Employee Directors" as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Act. The members of the Committee shall be selected by the Board of Directors. If a member of the Committee, for any reason, shall cease to serve, the vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors. Any member of the Committee may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Committee shall be designated by the Board of Directors, and meetings of the Committee may be called at any time by its Chairman or upon written request of a majority of the members of the Committee, provided that meetings may be held at any time without notice if all the members are present or if at any time before or after the meeting those not present waive notice of the meeting in writing. Subject to the preceding provision, at least one day's notice of the meeting shall be given in person or by telephone, letter, fax, telegram or cablegram. At all meetings of the Committee, a majority of the members of the Committee at the time of such meeting shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. Any act of a majority of the quorum present at a meeting shall be the act of the Committee.
Committee
5. . All key employees of the Corporation and its Affiliates shall be eligible to receive Incentive Awards under the Plan. The persons to whom Incentive Awards are to be offered under the Plan and the number of Shares with respect to which Incentive Awards are to be granted to each such person shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion subject, however, to the terms and conditions of the Plan. The Committee in its sole discretion may grant to any Non-Employee Director a Non-Qualified Stock Option to purchase a number of Shares determined by the Committee. Subject to Section 13 hereof, optioned Shares which may have been but were not purchased during any one twelve (12)-month period may be purchased during any one or more succeeding twelve (12)-month periods until expiration. Payment for the stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall be made in full at the time of the exercise of the Option by cash, by check payable to the order of the Corporation, or by the delivery to the Corporation of Mature Shares of Common Stock of the Corporation which shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Option, or by such other method as the Committee established under the Plan may permit from time to time, including payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board.
Participants
6. . The number of Options to be granted to any eligible person shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. At the time an Option is granted, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, designate whether such Option (a) is to be considered as an Incentive Stock Option, or (b) is to be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option for purposes of this Plan and the Code, or (c) is in part to be considered as an Incentive Stock Option and in part to be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option for purposes of this Plan and the Code; provided, however, that no Incentive Stock Option may be granted after March 12, 2012.
Grant of Options
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date an Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which Options which are designated as Incentive Stock Options (and any other incentive stock options granted to an employee after 1986 under any other incentive stock option plan maintained by the Corporation or any Affiliate that meets the requirements of Section 422 of the Code) first become exercisable in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options. This paragraph shall be applied by taking options into account in the order in which they are granted.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the granting of Options at different times to the same person.
The form of Option shall be as determined from time to time by the Committee. A certificate of Option signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President, attested by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation having the seal of the Corporation affixed thereto, shall be delivered to each person to whom an Option is granted.
7. . The Committee shall have the authority in its discretion to grant to any eligible person Rights which may be granted separately or in connection with an Option (either at the time of grant or at any time during the term of the Option; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, Rights may be granted only at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted). Rights granted in connection with an Option, shall be granted with respect to the same number of Shares then covered by the Option, subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Section 16 hereof, and may be exercised as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time of the grant of the Rights, either in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the exercise of the related Option.
Grant of Rights
Conjunctive Rights granted in connection with an Option shall entitle the holder thereof to receive payment from the Corporation, determined as hereinafter provided, only if and to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and is exercised. Upon any exercise of an Option in respect of which conjunctive Rights shall have been granted, the holder of the Rights shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of such exercise over the purchase price per Share payable upon exercise of the related Option (the "Price Spread"), or a portion of the Price Spread determined by the Committee at the time of grant, by (ii) the number of Shares in respect of which the related Option shall have then been so exercised; provided, however, that the amount of the payment which a holder of such Rights shall be entitled to receive upon any exercise of the Rights shall in no event exceed two times the aggregate purchase price payable by such holder for the Shares in respect of which the related Option shall have then been so exercised.
Alternative Rights granted in connection with an Option shall entitle the holder thereof to receive payment from the Corporation, determined as hereinafter provided, only if and to the extent that the related Option is exercisable, by surrendering the Option with respect to the number of Shares as to which such Rights are then exercised. Such Option, to the extent surrendered, shall be deemed exercised. Upon any exercise of alternative Rights, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Price Spread, or a portion of the Price Spread determined by the Committee at the time of grant, by (ii) the number of Shares in respect of which the Rights shall have then been so exercised. Alternative Rights granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option shall not be exercisable unless the Price Spread exceeds zero. Rights granted without relationship to an Option shall be exercisable as determined by the Committee, but in no event after seven (7) years from the date of grant. Such Rights shall entitle the holder, upon the exercise thereof, to receive payment from the Corporation of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of such exercise over the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date the Rights were granted (the "Value Spread"), or a portion of the Value Spread determined by the Committee at the time of grant, by (ii) the number of Shares in respect of which the Rights shall have then been so exercised.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, limit the amount payable upon the exercise of Rights. Any such limitation shall be determined as of the date of grant and noted on the certificate evidencing the grant of the Rights.
Payment of the amount determined hereunder upon the exercise of conjunctive Rights or Rights granted without relationship to an Option shall be made solely in cash. At the holder's election, payment of the amount determined hereunder upon the exercise of alternative Rights granted in connection with an Option may be made solely in cash, or solely in Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Rights, or in a combination of cash and Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of any Option or Rights, upon the exercise of such alternative Rights, the Committee shall have the power at its discretion to disapprove the holder's election as to the form (i.e., cash or Shares, or part in cash and part in Shares) in which payment of the Rights will be made and to substitute therefor payment as it determines. If the Committee does not disapprove an election made upon the exercise of Rights within 60 days after such exercise or election then the Committee shall be deemed to have approved such election. No fractional Shares shall be issued by the Corporation, and settlement therefor shall be made in cash.
The form of Rights shall be as determined from time to time by the Committee. A Certificate of Rights signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President, attested by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and having the seal of the Corporation affixed thereto, shall be delivered to each person to whom Rights are granted.
8. . The duration of any Option granted under the Plan shall be fixed by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no Option shall remain in effect for a period of more than seven (7) years from the date on which it is granted; and provided further that an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to an employee of the Corporation or an Affiliate who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or any Affiliate, may not have a term that exceeds five years from the date of grant. The duration of any Rights granted in connection with any Option granted under the Plan shall be coterminous with the duration of the related Option.
Duration of Option and Related Rights
9. . Except as otherwise provided hereunder, an Option and Rights, after the grant thereof, shall be exercisable by the holder at such rate and times as may be fixed by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time the Option and Rights are granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or any part of any remaining unexercised Options or Rights granted to any person may be exercised (a) subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, upon the holder's retirement at or after age 65, provided the holder has completed at least two full years of employment with the Corporation or any Affiliate, (b) subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, upon the death of the holder, (c) upon the holder's termination of employment in connection with a Change in Control, or (d) upon the occurrence of such special circumstance or event as in the opinion of the Committee merits special consideration.
Exercise of Options and Rights
As used in the Plan, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if
(i) Any person (except the Corporation, any subsidiary of the Corporation, any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the Corporation, or any person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Corporation for or pursuant to the terms of any such employee benefit plan), together with all affiliates and associates of such person, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate of 20% or more of the value of the outstanding equity or combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or
(ii) The shareholders of the Corporation approve a merger or consolidation the result of which is that the shareholders of the Corporation do not own or control at least 50% or more of the value of the outstanding equity or combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, or there occurs a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets or a plan of liquidation is approved; provided, however, that an internal reorganization shall not constitute a "Change in Control" if the shareholders of the Corporation own or control, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the value of the outstanding equity or combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the new company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of that company.
An Option shall be exercised by the delivery of a duly signed notice in writing to such effect, together with the Option certificate and the full purchase price of the Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option to the Corporate Secretary or an officer of the Corporation appointed by the Chairman of the Board for the purpose of receiving the sum. Payment of the full purchase price shall be made as follows: in cash or by check payable to the order of the Corporation, or by delivery to the Corporation of Mature Shares which shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Option or by such other methods as the Committee may permit from time to time, including payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. Any Rights exercised in conjunction therewith shall be exercised by the inclusion in such notice of a notice of exercise of Rights, together with the Rights certificate.
Within a reasonable time after the exercise of an Option, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered, to the person entitled thereto, a certificate for the Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option, and, if Rights have been exercised in conjunction therewith, the amount of cash determined in accordance with Section 7 hereof. If the Option and any conjunctive Rights shall have been exercised with respect to less than all of the Shares subject to the Option and Rights, the Corporation shall also cause to be delivered to the person entitled thereto an Option certificate and a Rights certificate with respect to the number of Shares equal to the difference between the number of Shares of the Option certificate and Rights certificate surrendered at the time of the exercise of the Option and Rights and the number of Shares with respect to which the Option and Rights were so exercised, or the original Option certificate and Rights certificate shall be endorsed to give effect to the partial exercise thereof. If any Option is treated in part as an Incentive Stock Option and in part as a Non-Qualified Stock Option, the Corporation shall designate the Shares that are treated as purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option by causing to be delivered a separate certificate therefor.
Rights that are exercisable as an alternative to the exercise of a related Option, or without any relationship to an Option, shall be exercised by the delivery of a duly signed notice in writing to such effect, together with the Rights certificate, and, in the case of alternative Rights, a specification of the percentages of the Rights which the holder desires to receive in cash and in Shares. Holders of alternative Rights shall also surrender the related Option certificate. Within a reasonable time thereafter, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered and/or issued to the person entitled thereto, the amount of cash and/or a certificate for the number of Shares determined in accordance with Section 7 hereof. Upon the exercise of alternative Rights, the number of Shares subject to exercise under the related Option or portion thereof shall be reduced by the number of Shares represented by the Option or portion thereof surrendered. Shares subject to Options or portions thereof surrendered upon the exercise of alternative Rights shall not be available for subsequent Incentive Awards under the Plan. If the Rights shall have been exercised with respect to less than all of the Shares subject thereto (or to the related Option, if any), the Corporation shall also cause to be delivered to the person entitled thereto a Rights certificate (and an Option certificate, in the case of alternative Rights) with respect to the difference between the number of Shares of the Rights certificate (and related Option certificate, if any) surrendered at the time of the exercise of the Rights and the number of Shares with respect to which the Rights were so exercised (and the related Option, if any, was so surrendered), or the original Rights certificate (and related Option certificate, if any) shall be endorsed to give effect to the partial exercise (and surrender) thereof.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of any Option or Rights, no Option or Rights granted pursuant to the Plan may be exercised at any time when the Option or Rights or the granting or exercise thereof violates any law or governmental order or regulation.
10. .
Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Awards
11. . The Committee shall have the authority in its discretion to grant to any eligible person Phantom Stock Awards which shall be subject to the following conditions:
Terms and Conditions of Phantom Stock Awards
12. . The purchase price per Share for Restricted Shares to be purchased pursuant to Restricted Stock Awards, or for the Shares to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option, shall be fixed by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Restricted Stock Award or Option; provided, however, that the purchase price per Share for the Shares to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option or Non-Qualified Stock Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date such Incentive Stock Option or Non-Qualified Stock Option is granted; and, provided further, that an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to an employee of the Corporation or an Affiliate who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or any Affiliate, must have a purchase price per Share equal to 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Purchase Price
13. . If a holder of an Option and/or Rights shall voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employ or service of the Corporation and its Affiliates (including retirement), the Option and Rights of such holder shall terminate forthwith, except that the holder shall have until the expiration of 3 months from the cessation of the holder's employment or service with the Corporation and its Affiliates (without regard to any period of severance) to exercise any unexercised Option and/or Rights the holder could have exercised on the day on which he left the employ or service of the Corporation and Affiliates, including those Options and/or Rights that become exercisable upon cessation of employment pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph of Section 9 hereof.
Termination of Employment
If the cessation of employment or service is due to death, the representatives of the estate of the holder shall have the privilege of exercising the unexercised Options and/or Rights which the deceased could have exercised at the time of his death, including those Options and/or Rights that become exercisable pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph of Section 9 hereof, provided that such exercise must be accomplished prior to the expiration of such Options and Rights and within six months after the death of the holder.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide with respect to an Option or Rights granted to any individual (and either at the time of grant of such Option or Rights or by an amendment thereafter to any such outstanding Option or Rights), that the post-termination or post-death exercise period shall be for a period of time specified by the Committee which is longer than the period which would otherwise apply pursuant to this Section 13, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Option or Rights.
If the employment or service of any holder with the Corporation or an Affiliate shall be terminated because of the holder's violation of the duties of such employment or service with the Corporation or its Affiliates, as he may from time to time have, the existence of which violation shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and which determination by the Committee shall be conclusive, all unexercised Options and Rights of such holder shall terminate immediately upon the termination of the holder's employment or service with the Corporation or an Affiliate, and a holder whose employment or service with the Corporation or an Affiliate is so terminated shall have no right after such termination to exercise any unexercised Option or Rights he might have exercised prior to the termination of his employment or service with the Corporation or an Affiliate.
Except as hereinafter provided, if a holder of a Restricted Stock Award shall voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employ [or service] of the Corporation and its Affiliates, all such Restricted Shares subject to restrictions at the time his employment [or service] terminates (and any dividends, distributions and adjustments retained by the Corporation with respect thereto) shall be forfeited and any consideration received therefor from the holder shall be returned to the holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all restrictions to which Restricted Stock Awards are subject shall lapse (a) upon the death or disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) of the holder, (b) upon the holder's termination of employment [or cessation of service as a Director] in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section 9 hereof), or (c) upon the occurrence of such special circumstance or event as in the opinion of the Committee merits special consideration.
Except as hereinafter provided, if a holder of a Phantom Stock Award shall voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employ [or service] of the Corporation and its Affiliates prior to the complete expiration of the vesting period, all amounts theretofor remaining payable pursuant to such Award (including any dividend equivalent amounts retained by the Corporation with respect thereto) shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vesting period under a Phantom Stock Award shall completely expire, and all amounts remaining payable thereunder shall be payable (a) upon the death or disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) of the holder, (b) upon the holder's termination of employment [or service] in connection with a Change in Control, or (c) upon the occurrence of such special circumstance or event as in the opinion of the Committee merits special consideration.
14. .
Transferability of Incentive Awards
15. . The Corporation or Affiliate will take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure compliance with all federal, state or local income tax withholding laws. In order to facilitate a Participant's payment of his withholding obligations with respect to Incentive Awards, the Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to elect to (a) deduct from any cash payment otherwise due to the Participant, the appropriate withholding amount, (b) pay to the Corporation in cash the appropriate withholding amount, (c) have the Corporation withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse or restrictions relating to) such Incentive Award, the fair market value of which is equal to the minimum statutory withholding amount, or (d) deliver to the Corporation Mature Shares already owned by the Participant, the fair market value of which is equal to the appropriate withholding amount.
Tax Withholding
16. . If prior to the complete exercise of any Option, or prior to the expiration or lapse of all of the restrictions and conditions imposed pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award, there shall be declared and paid a stock dividend upon the Shares or if the Shares shall be split up, converted, exchanged, reclassified, or in any way substituted for,
Adjustment Provision
Any fractional shares or securities payable upon the exercise of the Option as a result of such adjustment shall be payable in cash based upon the Fair Market Value of such shares or securities at the time of such exercise. If any such event should occur, the number of Shares with respect to which Incentive Awards remain to be issued, or with respect to which Incentive Awards may be reissued, shall be adjusted in a similar manner.
In addition to the adjustments provided for in the preceding paragraph, upon the occurrence of any of the events referred to in said paragraph prior to the complete exercise of any Rights, or prior to the complete expiration of the vesting period under a Phantom Stock Award, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the amount of cash and/or number of Shares or other property to which the holder of the Rights shall be entitled upon their exercise, or to which the holder of the Phantom Stock Award shall be entitled upon the expiration of the vesting period, so that there shall be no increase or dilution in the cash and/or value of the shares or other property to which the holder of Rights or of a Phantom Stock Award shall be entitled by reason of such events.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, rights offering, separation, reorganization or liquidation, or any other change in the corporate structure or outstanding Shares, the Committee may make such equitable adjustments to the number of Shares and the class of shares available hereunder or to any outstanding Incentive Awards as it shall deem appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
17. . The Corporation may postpone the issuance and delivery of Shares pursuant to the grant or exercise of any Incentive Award until (a) the admission of such Shares to listing on any stock exchange on which Shares of the Corporation of the same class are then listed and (b) the completion of such registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law, rule or regulation as the Corporation shall determine to be necessary or advisable. As a condition precedent to the issuance of Shares pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Incentive Award, the Corporation may require the recipient thereof to make such representations and furnish such information as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be appropriate to permit the Corporation, in light of the then existence or non-existence with respect to such Shares of an effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended, to issue the Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable act.
Issuance of Shares and Compliance with Securities Act
18. . Except as hereinafter provided, the Board of Directors or the Committee may at any time withdraw or from time to time amend the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Incentive Award not theretofor granted, and the Board of Directors or the Committee, with the consent of the affected holder of an Incentive Award, may at any time withdraw or from time to time amend the Plan and the terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards as have been theretofor granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Board of Directors nor the Committee shall (a) amend the Plan without the approval of the stockholders, if such approval is required by Section 422 or 162(m) of the Code, (b) materially amend the Plan without stockholder approval, or (c) without stockholder approval reprice any outstanding Incentive Award by either amending such Incentive Award to reduce the exercise price, purchase price or grant date Fair Market Value per Share thereof or canceling such Incentive Award and regranting or replacing such Incentive Award as or with an Incentive Award having a lower exercise price, purchase price or grant date Fair Market Value per Share.
Administration and Amendment of the Plan
The Committee shall have the sole authority to (i) determine the individuals to whom Incentive Awards shall be made under the Plan, (ii) determine the type, size and terms of the Incentive Awards to be made to each such individual, (iii) determine the time when the Incentive Awards will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise or restriction period, including the criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability and (iv) deal with any other matters arising under the Plan.
The Committee shall have full power and authority to administer and interpret the Plan, to make factual determinations and to adopt or amend such rules, regulations, agreements and instruments for implementing the Plan and for the conduct of its business as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion. The Committee's interpretations of the Plan and all determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having any interest in the Plan or in any Incentive Awards granted hereunder. All powers of the Committee shall be executed in its sole discretion, in the best interest of the Corporation, not as a fiduciary, and in keeping with the objectives of the Plan and need not be uniform as to similarly situated individuals.
19. . Except as required by Delaware corporate law, the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws.
Governing Law
20. . This Plan is conditioned upon its approval by the shareholders of the Corporation.
Effective Date of Plan
21. . The Plan shall be the controlling document. No other statements, representations, explanatory materials or examples, oral or written, may amend the Plan in any manner. The Plan shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Corporation and its successors and assigns.
Governing Document
22. . This Plan shall be unfunded. The Corporation shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any Incentive Awards under this Plan. In no event shall interest be paid or accrued on any Incentive Award, including unpaid installments of Incentive Awards.
Funding of the Plan
23. . Nothing in this Plan shall entitle any employee or other person to any claim or right to be granted an Incentive Award under this Plan, [except as provided in Section 5 with respect to Non-Employee Directors]. Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any individual any rights to be retained by or in the employ of the Corporation or any Affiliate, or any other employment rights.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Recipient are parties to a Termination and Change of Control Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2004, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Termination Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Committee has awarded to the Recipient a restricted stock award, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Stock Incentive Plan, the Termination Agreement and in this Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
Pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Recipient has been awarded on April 27, 2005 (the "Award Date"), a restricted stock award with respect to 350,000 Shares (the "Restricted Stock Award", and such Shares, the "Restricted Shares"), subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Stock Incentive Plan, the Termination Agreement and in this Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the same meanings as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan.
FIRST:
The purchase price for the Restricted Shares shall be $0.01 per Share, such amount to be withheld from the Recipient's pay, no later than 60 days after the Award Date.
SECOND:
The Restricted Shares shall become nonforfeitable on the earliest to occur of:
THIRD:
In addition, in the event of the Recipient's Retirement (as defined below) prior to the sixth anniversary of the Award Date, then a pro rata portion of the Restricted Shares shall become nonforfeitable. The pro rata portion of the Restricted Shares which shall become nonforfeitable shall be the number of Restricted Shares equal to the total number of Restricted Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full months of the Recipient's employment with the Company (or any successor or Affiliate) following the Award Date and the denominator of which shall be 72; provided, however, that no fractional Shares shall become nonforfeitable and cash shall be paid in lieu thereof. For purposes hereof, "Retirement" shall mean the Recipient's retirement from the Company (or any successor or Affiliate) at or after age 55 and the completion of at least 10 years of employment with the Company (or any successor or Affiliate). Except to the extent, if any, that the Restricted Shares shall have become nonforfeitable pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph THIRD, if the Recipient shall voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employ of the Company and its Affiliates prior to the sixth anniversary of the Award Date, the Restricted Shares (and any dividends, distributions and adjustments retained by the Company with respect thereto) shall be forfeited and the consideration paid pursuant to paragraph SECOND of this Agreement shall be returned to the Recipient.
Restrictions shall be imposed on a transfer of the Restricted Shares, and the Company shall place a stop order with the transfer agent against any transfer of such Shares and shall retain the stock certificate representing such Shares, until such time as the Restricted Shares shall become nonforfeitable in accordance with Paragraph THIRD. Prior to the lapse of the restrictions on the transferability of the Restricted Shares, the Recipient shall have all other rights and privileges of a beneficial and record owner with respect to such Shares, including, without limitation, voting rights and the right to receive dividends, distributions and adjustments with respect to such Shares; provided, however, that any dividends, distributions and adjustments with respect to the Restricted Shares, plus interest credited on any such dividends, shall be retained by the Company for the Recipient's account and for delivery to the Recipient, together with the stock certificate representing such Shares, only as and when such Restricted Shares have become nonforfeitable. For purposes of this paragraph FOURTH, interest shall be credited from the date a dividend with respect to the Restricted Shares is made to the date on which the Company distributes such amounts to the Recipient, at the five-year Treasury Note rate, plus 0.5%, as such rate is set forth in the Wall Street Journal as of the first business day of each calendar quarter.
FOURTH:
If prior to the expiration or lapse of all of the restrictions and conditions on the Restricted Shares under this Agreement, there shall be declared and paid a stock dividend upon the Restricted Shares or if the Restricted Shares shall be split up, converted, exchanged, reclassified or in any way substituted for, the Recipient shall receive, subject to the same restrictions and conditions as the original Restricted Shares subject to this Agreement, the same securities or other property as are received by the holders of the Company's Shares pursuant to such stock dividend, split up, conversion, exchange, reclassification or substitution. If the Recipient receives any securities or property of the Company (or any acquiring entity) pursuant to this Paragraph FIFTH, such securities or other property shall thereafter be deemed to be "Shares" and "Restricted Shares" within the meaning of this Agreement. In the event of any transaction to which this Paragraph FIFTH applies (other than a stock dividend), the Committee (or the Company, if the Committee no longer exists) shall adjust the Target Price in Paragraph THIRD, subparagraph (d), to take into account the effect of the transaction.
FIFTH:

Any such election shall be made within five (5) business days after the Restricted Shares shall become nonforfeitable pursuant to such procedures as are established by the Company for this purpose. If the Recipient fails to make any such election within such five (5) business days or the Recipient fails to satisfy its withholding obligations within thirty (30) days after the Restricted Shares shall become nonforfeitable, the Company shall satisfy its withholding obligations by withholding the number of Restricted Shares as described in, and determined pursuant to, clause (iii) above, which Restricted Shares shall be liquidated by the Company in order for the Company to satisfy its wthholding obligations. Pending the election and payment by the Recipient of the withholding obligations, the Recipient hereby grants to the Company a security interest in a number of Restricted Shares having a Fair Market Value, valued on the date on which such withholding requirement arises, equal to the amount required to be withheld.

Paoli, PA, September 15, 2005  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it has agreed to acquire HCC Industries ("HCC"), a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered hermetic connectors, terminals, headers and microelectronic packages for sophisticated electronic applications in the aerospace, defense, industrial and petrochemical markets. Headquartered near Los Angeles, CA, HCC has annual sales of approximately $104 million. It will be acquired from an investor group led by Windward Capital Partners and management for approximately $162 million in cash. This acquisition is subject to normal closing conditions and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter.
"HCC will become a new platform for our Electromechanical Group. The excellent internal growth of this business coupled with our ability to add additional synergistic acquisitions should enable this new platform to become a major part of our Electromechanical Group," comments Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank S. Hermance.
"HCC's significant technological differentiation and strong customer orientation enable the rapid design and production of hermetic (moisture-proof) connectors, terminals, headers and microelectronic packages for customers' specific applications. There is considerable synergy with AMETEK's markets and distribution channels, particularly in Aerospace and Defense as well as shared technology with our Specialty Metals Division," added Mr. Hermance.
HCC designs and manufactures high-precision glass-to-metal seals and ceramic-to-metal seals. These seals protect sensitive electronics from the environment as well as provide thermal management capabilities. Products fall into three categories: connectors, terminals and headers, and microcircuit packaging. Connectors facilitate the passage of electrical current between two devices and allow them to be mechanically coupled and decoupled. Terminals and headers are interconnect devices that isolate electrical signals. Microcircuit packaging protects semiconductor circuitry from the environment.
AMETEK's Electromechanical Group (EMG) is the world's largest manufacturer of electric motors and blowers for the floor-care industry and a leader in brushless air-moving motors and thermal management subsystems for aerospace, defense, business machine, mass transit, medical, and computer markets. EMG's Specialty Metal Products Division is a world leader in metal powder, strip, wire, bonded products and advanced metallurgical materials. EMG had 2004 sales of approximately $565 million.

Exhibit 99.(a)

Paoli, PA, October 20, 2005  AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced third quarter results, posting strong year-over-year increases in sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's third quarter 2005 sales of $344.5 million were up 11% from the $310.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Operating income for the third quarter of 2005 was $58.7 million, up 16% from the third quarter of 2004. Net income of $35.4 million was up 22% from last year's third quarter and diluted earnings per share were $.50 per share, up 19% over the same quarter of last year.
"AMETEK had a very good third quarter. Sales and earnings grew at double-digit rates driven by the combined benefits of core growth, acquisitions and our focus on operational excellence," commented Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Our markets remain strong. The internal order growth for AMETEK was 6% in the quarter. Each group contributed to this strong performance with the Electronic Instruments Group up 7% and the Electromechanical Group up 5%. We had particularly strong order performance in our aerospace and power businesses," added Mr. Hermance.
In the quarter the Company experienced several unusual events. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of a facility of approximately $4 million. Additionally the Company incurred higher than normal expenses of approximately $2 million to accelerate the movement of production to low-cost locales, and income was adversely impacted by approximately $1 million from the effects of the Gulf hurricanes. These items affected operating income. Separately, reflected in other expenses, is approximately $1 million of costs related to an acquisition that AMETEK chose not to complete.
For the first nine months of 2005, AMETEK sales increased 14% to $1.031 billion from $906.0 million in the same period of 2004. Operating income totaled $174.5 million, a 23% increase from $141.4 million earned in the first nine months of last year. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $102.6 million, up 26% from $81.4 million in the same period of 2004. Diluted earnings per share were up 23% to $1.45 per share for the first nine months of 2005.
AMETEK POSTS STRONG THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
PAGE 2.
EIG's third quarter 2005 sales were $205.5 million, up 19% from last year's level of $172.9 million. Third quarter group operating income was up 34% to $43.1 million, versus $32.1 million in the same period of 2004. Group operating margins were 21.0%, up from 18.6% in the third quarter of 2004.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG had a great quarter," noted Mr. Hermance. "The revenue increase was driven by internal growth and the contribution from the Spectro acquisition. Operating income was up sharply, driven by the top-line performance, the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives across the Group and the gain on the sale of the facility."
EMG's sales of $139.0 million were up 1% from $137.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter group operating income of $22.1 million was down 8%, versus $24.0 million reported for the same period of 2004. EMG's operating income margin in the third quarter of 2005 was 15.9%, compared with 17.4% in the third quarter of 2004.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG sales were up 1% as strength in the differentiated businesses overcame a slight decline in our cost-driven motor business. Higher than normal expenses to accelerate the movement of manufacturing to low-cost locales drove the profit reduction. Without these additional costs EMG operating income would have been essentially unchanged," added Mr. Hermance.
"We expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be up over 20% on solid internal growth and the benefits from our acquisition program. Earnings are expected to be $.52 to $.53 per diluted share in the quarter," commented Mr. Hermance.
Outlook
"For 2005 we expect revenue to increase approximately 15%. Based on continued strength in our markets we are raising our 2005 earnings estimate to $1.98 to $1.99 per diluted share, an increase of 21% to 22% over last year," noted Mr. Hermance.
The Company recently closed two acquisitions: HCC Industries and the Solartron Group. These companies are highly differentiated businesses that together will add nearly $155 million in annual sales to AMETEK.
Two Acquisitions Closed
On October 7, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of HCC Industries ("HCC"), a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered hermetic connectors, terminals, headers and microelectronic packages for sophisticated electronic applications in the aerospace, defense, industrial and petrochemical markets. Headquartered near Los Angeles, CA, HCC has annual sales of approximately $104 million. It was acquired from an investor group led by Windward Capital Partners and management for approximately $162 million in cash.
HCC Industries
"HCC becomes a new platform for our Electromechanical Group. The excellent internal growth of this business coupled with our ability to add additional synergistic acquisitions should enable this new platform to become a major part of our Electromechanical Group," noted Mr. Hermance.

Paoli, PA, January 25, 2006  AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced fourth quarter and full-year results that established records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's fourth quarter 2005 sales of $403.8 million were up 24% over the same period of 2004. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $64.9 million, an 18% increase from the $54.8 million recorded in the same period of 2004.

Fourth Quarter Results
AMETEK achieved 2005 sales of $1.43 billion, up 16% from year 2004 results. Operating income of $239.4 million was up 22% from $196.2 million for 2004. Net income grew to $140.6 million, up 25% from the $112.7 million earned in 2004, and diluted earnings per share of $1.99 were up 22% from $1.63 per share in 2004. Sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share were full-year records.
Full-Year Results
"AMETEK had a great 2005," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Solid internal growth in each of our segments and a record year of acquisitions drove the strong top-line growth. Our excellent earnings performance resulted from an improved mix of businesses and our focused operational excellence initiatives."
For the 2005 fourth quarter, EIG sales increased 25% to $230.7 million. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $46.2 million, compared with $40.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 15%. Operating margins for the quarter were 20.0%, compared with 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG sales were up in the quarter on internal growth in our aerospace, power, and process businesses and contributions from the SPECTRO and Solartron acquisitions. EIG margins remained very strong," added Mr. Hermance.
For the year, EIG sales of $808.5 million were up 21% from 2004 sales of $667.4 million. Operating income was $166.4 million for 2005, up 32% versus $126.4 million earned in 2004. Operating margins were 20.6% in 2005, up from 18.9% in 2004.

PAGE 2.
For the fourth quarter of 2005, EMG's sales were $173.1 million, a 22% increase over the same period of 2004. Operating income of $26.0 million was up 19% from the $21.9 million recorded in the same period of 2004. Operating margins for the quarter were 15.0%, compared with 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG fourth quarter sales were up on good internal growth in both our differentiated businesses and our cost-driven motor businesses and the contribution from HCC Industries, acquired early in the fourth quarter. Operating margins were down from the fourth quarter of last year," noted Mr. Hermance.
For the year, EMG's sales increased 11% to $626.0 million, compared with $564.9 million in 2004. Operating income was $100.3 million for 2005, up 6% from the $94.3 million earned in 2004. Operating margins were 16.0% in 2005, compared with 16.7% in 2004.
Effective January 1, 2006, AMETEK is adopting the provisions of FAS 123R, "Accounting for Share-Based Payments". AMETEK will be restating prior period results to reflect this change using the retrospective restatement method. On this basis, reported earnings for 2005 are expected to be reduced by $0.05 to $1.94 per diluted share to reflect the effect of stock option expense. In 2006 the effect of stock option expense on net income is also expected to be a $0.05 per diluted share reduction.
2006 Outlook
"We expect 2006 to conform to our long-term business model of mid-single digit core growth combined with approximately 10% acquisition growth, yielding a mid-teen percentage growth in overall revenue. Acquisition growth will be driven by the full year impact of the SPECTRO, Solartron and HCC Industries acquisitions we completed in 2005," commented Mr. Hermance. "Earnings are estimated to be approximately $2.25 to $2.30 per diluted share, an increase of 16% to 19% over the 2005 level of $1.94 per diluted share (after restatement for stock option expense). The increase in estimated earnings reflects the benefits of the revenue growth, our continued focus on operational excellence and substantial investments in product development and sales and marketing to drive future growth."
"Our 2006 plan contemplates higher than normal investments of approximately $9 million, or $.08 per diluted share, on new product development and global and market expansion initiatives. These investments will enhance our future internal growth rate and are heavily weighted to our differentiated businesses," said Mr. Hermance.
"First quarter 2006 sales are expected to be up in the high teens on a percentage basis from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.52 to $0.53 per diluted share, an increase of 18% to 20% over last year's first quarter of $0.44 (after restatement for stock option expense)," concluded Mr. Hermance.

The Board may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders.
2. Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of the stockholders will be held at such date and time as may be designated from time to time by the Board, at which meeting the stockholders will elect by a plurality vote the Directors to succeed those whose terms expire at such meeting and will transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with By-Law 8.
3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by (a) the Chairman or (b) the Corporate Secretary within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written request of a majority of the Whole Board. Any such request by a majority of the Whole Board must be sent to the Chairman and the Corporate Secretary and must state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Special meetings of holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock, if any, may be called in the manner and for the purposes provided in the applicable Preferred Stock Designation. At a special meeting of stockholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as (i) has been specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Chairman or a majority of the Whole Board or (ii) otherwise is properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer of the meeting (as described in By-Law 8) or by or at the direction of a majority of the Whole Board.
4. Notice of Meetings. Written notice of every meeting of the stockholders, stating the place, date, and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, will be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 calendar days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting must be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which properly could have been transacted at the original meeting.
5. Inspectors. The Board may appoint one or more inspectors of election to act as judges of the voting and to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, in advance of such meeting. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer of the meeting may appoint one or more substitute inspectors.
6. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or in a Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business thereat. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.
7. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or in a Preferred Stock Designation, each stockholder will be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the Company on the record date for the meeting and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Corporate Secretary. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Corporate Secretary. The vote upon any question brought before a meeting of the stockholders may be by voice vote, unless otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws or unless the Chairman or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting otherwise determine. Every vote taken by written ballot will be counted by the inspectors of election. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and which has actually been voted will be the act of the stockholders, except in the election of Directors or as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, a Preferred Stock Designation, or by law.
8. Order of Business. (a) The Chairman, or any officer of the Company designated by a majority of the Whole Board, will call meetings of the stockholders to order and will act as presiding officer thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of the stockholders will also determine the order of business and have the authority in his or her sole discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including without limitation by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the Company or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such stockholders' meeting, by ascertaining whether any stockholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of the stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of the stockholders.
(b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the Whole Board, or (iii) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder of the Company in accordance with paragraph (c) of this By-Law 8.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 nor more than 90 calendar days prior to the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is not made at least 75 calendar days prior to the date of the annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10 calendar day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the annual meeting.

The presiding officer of the annual meeting will determine whether or not business was properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this By-Law 8 and, if he or she determines that such business was not properly brought before the meeting, then he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting will not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law 8, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law 8. For purposes of this By-Law and By-Law 13, "public announcement" means disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock, will be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation.
11. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.

Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director's successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board will shorten the term of an incumbent Director.

To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice must set forth or include (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Company's books, of the stockholder giving the notice and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (ii) a representation that the stockholder giving the notice is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) the class and number of shares of stock of the Company owned beneficially and of record by the stockholder giving the notice and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between or among any of (A) the stockholder giving the notice, (B) the beneficial owner on whose behalf the notice is given, (C) each nominee, and (D) any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder giving the notice; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by the stockholder giving the notice as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (vi) the signed consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. At the request of the Board, any person nominated by the Board for election as a Director must furnish to the Corporate Secretary that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. The presiding officer of the meeting for election of Directors will determine whether or not a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this By-Law 13, and if he or she determines that such nomination was not made in accordance with such procedures, then he or she will so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination will be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law 13, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law 13.

22. Generally. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-Laws, or the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever by law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws notice is required to be given to any Director or stockholder, it will not be construed to require personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such Director or stockholder, at the address of such Director or stockholder as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice will be deemed to be given on the business day following the day on which the same is deposited in the United States mail.

Attendance of a person at a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
24. Generally.

If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders will be at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders will apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date will not be more than 60 calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose will be at the close of business on the calendar day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(c) The Company will be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, and will not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Company has notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.
33. Damages and Expenses. (a) Without limiting the generality or effect of Article Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect indemnify any person (an "Indemnitee") who is or was involved in any manner (including without limitation as a party or a witness) or is threatened to be made so involved in any threatened, pending, or completed investigation, claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including without limitation any action, suit, or proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) (a "Proceeding") by reason of the fact that such person is or was or had agreed to become a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Board or an officer of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other entity, whether for profit or not for profit (including the heirs, executors, administrators, or estate of such person), or anything done or not by such person in any such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. Such indemnification will be a contract right and will include the right to receive payment in advance of any expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law as then in effect.
(b) The right of indemnification provided in this By-Law 33 will not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled, and will be applicable to Proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this By-Law 33, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption.
(c) In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions, and remedies will apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this By-Law 33:
(i) All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding will be advanced to the Indemnitee by the Company within 30 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements will reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if and to the extent required by law at the time of such advance, will include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amounts advanced as to which it may ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled. If such an undertaking is required by law at the time of an advance, no security will be required for such undertaking and such undertaking will be accepted without reference to the recipient's financial ability to make repayment.
(ii) To obtain indemnification under this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will submit to the Corporate Secretary a written request, including such documentation supporting the claim as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "Supporting Documentation"). The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification will be made not more than 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Corporate Secretary will promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification advise the Board in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this By-Law 33 will be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), if they constitute a quorum of the Board, or, in the case of an Indemnitee that is not a present or former officer of the Company, by any committee of the Board or committee of officers or agents of the Company designated for such purpose by a majority of the Whole Board; (B) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel if (1) a Change of Control has occurred and the Indemnitee so requests or (2) in the case of an Indemnitee that is a present or former officer of the Company, a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (C) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (D) as provided in subparagraph (iii) below. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to clause (B) above, a majority of the Disinterested Directors will select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control has occurred, the Indemnitee will select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Board does not reasonably object.
(iii) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33 upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with subparagraph (c) (ii) above, and thereafter the Company will have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under subparagraph (c) (ii) to determine entitlement to indemnification has not been appointed or has not made a determination within 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee will be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the Indemnitee will be entitled to such indemnification unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding described in paragraph (a) of this By-Law 33, or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was not unlawful.
(iv) (A) In the event that a determination is made pursuant to subparagraph (c) (ii) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33, (1) the Indemnitee will be entitled to seek an adjudication of his or her entitlement to such indemnification either, at the Indemnitee's sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (2) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration will be de novo and the Indemnitee will not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (3) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration the Company will have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33.
(B) If a determination is made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) or (iii) of this By-Law 33 that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company will be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five business days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and will be conclusively bound by such determination unless (1) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (2) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i) of this By-Law 33 or payment of indemnification is not made within five business days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) or (iii) of this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Company's obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of any event described in subclause (1) or (2) of this clause (B) (a "Disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such action the Company will have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.
(C) The Company will be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (c)(iv) that the procedures and presumptions of this By-Law 33 are not valid, binding, and enforceable and will stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this By-Law 33.
(D) In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (c)(iv), seeks a judicial adjudication of, or an award in arbitration to enforce, his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be entitled to recover from the Company, and will be indemnified by the Company against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it is determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration will be prorated accordingly.
(v) For purposes of this paragraph (c):
(A) "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events:
(1) The Company is merged, consolidated, or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal entity, and as a result of such merger, consolidation, or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of such corporation or entity immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of the Voting Stock immediately prior to such transaction;
(2) The Company sells or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation or other legal entity and, as a result of such sale or transfer, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such other corporation or entity immediately after such sale or transfer is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock immediately prior to such sale or transfer;
(3) There is a report filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Voting Stock;
(4) The Company files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein) that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(5) If, during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the Directors cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (5) each Director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by the Company's stockholders, by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors (or a committee of the Board) then still in office who were Directors at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a Director at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of clauses (3) or (4) of this paragraph (c)(v)(A), unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" will not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of such clauses (3) or (4) solely because (x) the Company, (y) an entity in which the Company, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities (a "Subsidiary"), or (z) any employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K, or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 20% or otherwise, or because the Company reports that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
(B) "Disinterested Director" means a Director of the Company who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.
(C) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm or a member of a law firm that neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent (1) the Company or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (2) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this By-Law 33. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" will not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing under the law of the State of Delaware, would be precluded from representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights under this By-Law 33.
(d) If any provision or provisions of this By-Law 33 are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this By-Law 33 (including without limitation all portions of any paragraph of this By-Law 33 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this By-Law 33 (including without limitation all portions of any paragraph of this By-Law 33 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.
34. Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Indemnitee against any expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement or incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding referred to in By-Law 33 or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect. The Company may enter into contracts with any person entitled to indemnification under By-Law 33 or otherwise, and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest, or use other means (including without limitation a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in By-Law 33.
35. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Company will end on December 31 or such date as may be fixed from time to time by the Board.
36. Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal and use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
37. Reliance upon Books, Reports, and Records. Each Director, each member of a committee designated by the Board, and each officer of the Company will, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports, or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company's officers or employees, or committees of the Board, or by any other person or entity as to matters the Director, committee member, or officer believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company.
38. Time Periods. In applying any provision of these By-Laws that requires that an act be done or not be done a specified number of days prior to an event or that an act be done during a period of a specified number of days prior to an event, calendar days will be used unless otherwise specified, the day of the doing of the act will be excluded and the day of the event will be included.

Exhibit 99.(a)

Paoli, PA, April 20, 2006  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced first quarter results that established records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's first quarter 2006 sales of $423.9 million were up 27% over the same period of 2005. Operating income for the first quarter of 2006 was $70.8 million, a 32% increase from the $53.6 million recorded in the same period of 2005. Net income in the first quarter of 2006 increased 30% to $40.3 million, or $.57 per diluted share, from the first quarter 2005 level of $31.0 million, or $.44 per diluted share.
"AMETEK had an outstanding quarter which exceeded our expectations," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong internal growth of 9%, combined with the contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow the top-line by 27%. Operating income margin was up 70 basis points and net income was up 30% as we translated the top-line growth into bottom-line performance," he commented.
For the 2006 first quarter, EIG sales increased 31% to $236.4 million. Operating income was $47.7 million, compared with $36.3 million in the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 32%. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 20.2%, from 20.0% in the first quarter of 2005.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG had a great first quarter. Sales were up on strong core growth in our power, process and analytical, and aerospace businesses together with the contribution from the acquisitions of SPECTRO, Solartron and Pulsar Technologies. Operating income was up 32%, benefiting from the top-line growth and continued focus on operational excellence improvements," said Mr. Hermance.
For the first quarter of 2006, EMG sales were $187.4 million, a 22% increase over the same period of 2005. Operating income of $32.0 million was up 31% from the $24.4 million recorded in the same period of 2005. Operating margins for the quarter were 17.0%, compared with 16.0% in the first quarter of 2005.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG also had a great first quarter. Sales were up nicely, driven by solid core growth in both our differentiated and cost-driven businesses and the acquisition of HCC Industries. Profitability was strong as a result of the increased volume and our operational excellence initiatives," commented Mr. Hermance.
AMETEK ACHIEVES RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Page 2
"We expect 2006 to conform to our long-term business model of mid-single digit core growth combined with approximately 10% acquisition growth, yielding a mid-teen percentage growth in overall revenue. Acquisition growth will be driven by the full-year impact of the SPECTRO, Solartron, HCC Industries and Pulsar Technologies acquisitions," commented Mr. Hermance. "Given our strong first quarter results and the expectation of continued strength in our markets, we have raised our estimated earnings to a range of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share, an increase of 19% to 21% over the 2005 level of $1.94 per diluted share."
2006 Outlook
"Our second quarter 2006 sales are expected to be up in the high teens on a percentage basis from last year's second quarter. We expect second quarter earnings will be approximately $.57 to $.59 per diluted share, an increase of 16% to 20% over last year's second quarter," concluded Mr. Hermance.
The above operating results reflect the adoption of FAS 123R for expensing stock options under the modified retrospective method. Results for 2005 have been adjusted on this basis.

Paoli, PA, June 15, 2006  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it has acquired Land Instruments International Limited ("Land Instruments"), a global supplier of high-end analytical instrumentation.

"In addition, Land Instruments' combustion efficiency and environmental monitoring products, widely used in the power and process industries, nicely complement our existing Thermox product line. Higher energy prices and ever more stringent environmental regulations are growth drivers for these instruments," he concluded.
Land Instruments joins AMETEK as part of its Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) a recognized leader in advanced monitoring, testing, calibrating, and display instruments for the process, aerospace, power, and industrial markets with worldwide sales in 2005 of approximately $809 million.

Paoli, PA, July 17, 2006  AMETEK Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it expects its second quarter and full year 2006 results to substantially exceed its prior estimates.
The Company now expects second quarter diluted earnings per share to be approximately $.64 to $.65, up from its previous guidance of $.57 to $.59 per diluted share. Second quarter sales are expected to be in the range of $450 million, up approximately 28% from the $352.1 million for the second quarter of 2005.
"AMETEK had an outstanding quarter which surpassed our expectations," stated Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong internal growth in each of the Company's two segments, combined with the contributions from acquired businesses drove the strong top-line growth. We translated this top-line growth into bottom-line performance, increasing diluted earnings per share 31% to 33% over last year's second quarter," he commented.
"Given our strong first half results and the expectation of continued strength in our markets, we have raised our full year 2006 estimated earnings to a range of $2.42 to $2.46 per diluted share, up from our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share," commented Mr. Hermance.
Mr. Hermance also noted, "While the Department of Homeland Security's failure to select AMETEK as a vendor for The Department's Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Monitor program is a disappointment, AMETEK will continue to pursue other global opportunities for advanced radiation detection systems."

Paoli, PA, October 26, 2006  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded a contract to AMETEK (NYSE:AME) for the design, development and production of a high-resolution portable radiation detection system. The system will be used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, public safety officials and other first responders to screen vehicles and search public facilities for potentially harmful nuclear materials.
The contract calls for a base year award of $2.4 million for research and development. As well, the contract contains option years for both research and development and production. If all option years are exercised by the government, the total value of the contract will range from approximately $5 million to $50 million over a five year period.
"AMETEK is pleased to be selected as the only high-resolution germanium supplier for this important program. We believe our system represents the best technology for quickly, accurately and reliably identifying nuclear material and determining whether or not it poses a threat," noted AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank S. Hermance.
"Our Detective family of high-resolution radiation detection systems represents a substantial advance in system performance and significantly improves the ability to detect potentially harmful radioactive material without interfering with the normal flow of commerce.
"These systems employ a unique class of high-purity germanium-based gamma ray detectors that offer the best available combination of resolution and sensitivity for the rapid, positive identification of nuclear materials. These detectors can identify nuclear material which can be used in a nuclear weapon, an improvised nuclear device or a dirty bomb," added Mr. Hermance.
This award from DHS follows a number of recent wins for AMETEK's radiation detection systems. In recent months, AMETEK has been awarded contracts totaling more than $12 million by the US Departments of Defense and Energy and the UK Ministry of Defence. These include standard handheld Detective radiation identifiers, a backpack version of the Detective, and a transportable portal system.

Item 1.01.      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On May 23, 2007, the Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 2, 2007 (the "Record Date"). Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one four-hundredth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), at a purchase price of $160.00, subject to adjustment (the "Purchase Price"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent. The declaration of the dividend replaces the Company's existing shareholder rights plan, which expired on June 2, 2007.
          The Rights will separate from the Common Stock upon a "Distribution Date," which will occur upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a Person of affiliated or associated Persons (other than those who report ownership on Schedule 13G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the date of the announcement being the "Stock Acquisition Date"), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a Person beneficially owning 20% or more of such outstanding shares of Common Stock.
          Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be exercisable, will not be represented by a separate certificate, and will not be transferable apart from the Common Stock, but will instead be evidenced, (i) with respect to any of the shares of Common Stock held in uncertificated book-entry form (a "Book-Entry") outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Book-Entry and (ii) with respect to the shares of Common Stock evidenced by Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate, and the transfer on the Company's Direct Registration System of any shares of Common Stock represented by a Book-Entry or a certificate will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with such shares of Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Rights Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and, thereafter, the separate Rights Certificates alone will represent the Rights.
          The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on June 2, 2017 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described below.
          In the event (a "Flip-in Event") that a Person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (except pursuant to a tender offer or an exchange offer for all outstanding shares of Common Stock at a price and on terms which a majority of the Directors who are not officers of the Company and who are not representatives, nominees, affiliates or associates of such Person, after receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms, determines to be fair to and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (a "Permitted Offer")), each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of such Right, Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a then current market value equal to two times the Purchase Price (i.e., at a 50% discount to the then current market value). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, following the occurrence of any Flip-in Event, all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person (or by certain related parties) will be null and void. However, Rights will not be exercisable following the occurrence of any Flip-in Event until such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable by the Company as set forth below.
          In the event (a "Flip-Over Event") that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date (i) the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, (ii) the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation in a merger but its Common Stock is changed or exchanged for stock or securities of any other Person or cash or any other property (other than a merger meeting certain conditions which follows an offer for all outstanding shares of Common Stock which a majority of the unaffiliated Directors who are not officers of the Company determine to be fair to and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders), or (iii) or more of the Company's assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred (in one transaction or a series of related transactions), then each holder of a Right (except Rights which previously have been voided as set forth above) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise at the then current Purchase Price (as set forth in the Rights Agreement), common stock of the acquiring company having a then current market value equal to two times the Purchase Price (i.e., at a 50% discount). The events set forth in this paragraph and the Flip-in Events described in the second preceding paragraph are referred to as the "Triggering Events."
50%
          The Company may not engage in a transaction with an Acquiring Person constituting a Flip-Over Event unless the Acquiring Person meets certain conditions. If the Acquiring Person's (or its affiliated entity's) common stock has not been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the preceding twelve months, but it is a direct or indirect subsidiary of another company which has registered common stock, the Rights shall be exercisable as described above to purchase the common stock of such parent company. Moreover, the Company may not engage in a flip-over transaction unless the Acquiring Person (or its affiliated entity or parent, as applicable), (i) has sufficient shares of common stock authorized to permit the full exercise of the Rights and (ii) enters into an agreement containing the terms set forth above and providing that, as soon as practicable after the date of the Flip-Over Event, the Acquiring Person will register the Rights and the securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the Expiration Date of the Rights Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a merger or consolidation will not constitute a Flip-Over Event if (i) the transaction is consummated with a Person who acquired Common Stock pursuant to Permitted Offer or with a subsidiary of such Person; (ii) the price per share of Common Stock offered in such transaction is not less than the price paid to holders of the Company's Common Stock whose shares were purchased in the Permitted Offer; and (iii) the form of consideration offered in the transaction is the same as the form of consideration paid pursuant to the Permitted Offer.
          The Purchase Price payable, and the number of units of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) if holders of the Preferred Stock are granted certain rights or warrants to subscribe for Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock, or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions of one four-hundredth of a share, or integral multiples thereof) will be issued and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.
          At any time until the earlier of (a) ten days following the Stock Acquisition Date or (b) the Final Expiration Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right (payable in cash, Common Stock or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors). Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the $.0l redemption price.
          Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for Common Stock (or other consideration) of the Company or for common stock of the acquiring company as set forth above, or are redeemed as provided above.
          Other than certain provisions relating to the principal economic terms of the Rights, any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Distribution Date. Thereafter, the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board in order to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights (other than an Acquiring Person or an affiliate or associate thereof), or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement; provided, however, that an amendment to lengthen the time period governing redemption may be made only if the Rights are redeemable and an amendment to lengthen any other time period may be made only for the purpose of protecting, enhancing or clarifying the rights of, and/or benefits to, the holders of Rights (other than any Acquiring Person).
          The Rights will have certain anti-takeover effects. Exercise of the Rights will cause substantial dilution to a Person that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The existence of Rights, however, should not affect an offer at a fair price and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders as determined by the Board of Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors since the Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time until ten days following the Stock Acquisition Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Rights at the $.0l redemption price.
          The Rights Agreement between the Company and the Rights Agent specifying the terms of the Rights, which includes as an exhibit the form of Rights Certificate, is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement.

Duties of Rights Agent
           Section 21. . The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing mailed to the Company, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock, by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights Certificates by first-class mail. In the event the transfer agency relationship in effect between the Company and the Rights Agent terminates, the Rights Agent will be deemed to resign automatically on the effective date of such termination; and any required notice will be sent by the Company. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock, by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Rights Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then any registered holder of any Rights Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (A) a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of the State of New York (or of any other state of the United States so long as such corporation is authorized to do business as a banking institution in the State of New York), in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 or (B) a subsidiary of a corporation described in clause (A) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Change of Rights Agent
           Section 22. . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Rights Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, granted or awarded as of the Distribution Date, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; , , that (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such Rights Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

From and after the Distribution Date and subject to the provisions of this Section 27, the Company and the Rights Agent shall, if the Company so directs, supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights Certificates in order (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, (iii) to shorten or lengthen any time period hereunder or (iv) to change or supplement the provisions hereunder in any manner which the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights Certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person); this Agreement may not be supplemented or amended to lengthen, pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence, (A) a time period relating to when the Rights may be redeemed at such time as the Rights are not then redeemable, or (B) any other time period unless such lengthening is for the purpose of protecting, enhancing or clarifying the rights of, and/or the benefits to, the holders of Rights (other than an Acquiring Person and its Affiliates and Associates).

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated; , , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any such term, provision, covenant or restriction is held by such court or authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment that severing the invalid language from this Agreement would adversely affect the purpose or effect of this Agreement, the right of redemption set forth in Section 23 hereof shall be reinstated and shall not expire until the close of business on the tenth day following the date of such determination by the Board of Directors. Without limiting the foregoing, if any provision requiring a specific group of the Board of Directors to act is held by any court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such determination shall be made by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with applicable law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws.

Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series B Liquidation Preference by (ii) 400 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number").

          This certifies that ________________, or registered assigns, is the registered owner of the number of Rights set forth above, each of which entitles the owner thereof, subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 2, 2007 (the "Rights Agreement"), between AMETEK, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Rights Agent"), to purchase from the Company at any time prior to 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on June 2, 2017 at the office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, or its successors as Rights Agent, one four-hundredth (1/400th) of a fully paid, non-assessable share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") of the Company, at a purchase price of $160.00 per one four-hundredth (1/400th) of a share (the "Purchase Price"), upon presentation and surrender of this Rights Certificate with the Form of Election to Purchase and related Certificate duly executed. The number of Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate (and the number of shares which may be purchased upon exercise thereof) set forth above, and the Purchase Price per share set forth above, are the number and Purchase Price as of June 2, 2007 based on the Preferred Stock as constituted at such date. The Company reserves the right to require prior to the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) that a number of Rights be exercised so that only whole shares of Preferred Stock will be issued.
          Upon the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement), if the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate are beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of any such Acquiring Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), (ii) a transferee of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate, or (iii) under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement, a transferee of a person who, after such transfer, became an Acquiring Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person, such Rights shall become null and void and no holder hereof shall have any right with respect to such Rights from and after the occurrence of such Section 11(a)(ii) Event.
          As provided in the Rights Agreement, the Purchase Price and the number and kind of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities which may be purchased upon the exercise of the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate are subject to modification and adjustment upon the happening of certain events, including Triggering Events.
          This Rights Certificate is subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, which terms, provisions and conditions are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof and to which Rights Agreement reference is hereby made for a full description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities hereunder of the Rights Agent, the Company and the holders of the Rights Certificates, which limitations of rights include the temporary suspension of the exercisability of such Rights under the specific circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. Copies of the Rights Agreement are on file at the above-mentioned office of the Rights Agent and are also available upon written request to the Rights Agent.
          This Rights Certificate, with or without other Rights Certificates, upon surrender at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, may be exchanged for another Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates of like tenor and date evidencing Rights entitling the holder to purchase a like aggregate number of one four-hundredths (1/400ths) of a share of Preferred Stock as the Rights evidenced by the Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates surrendered shall have entitled such holder to purchase. If this Rights Certificate shall be exercised in part, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender hereof another Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates for the number of whole Rights not exercised.
          Subject to the provisions of the Rights Agreement, the Rights evidenced by this Certificate may be redeemed by the Company at its option at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of the close of business on (i) the tenth day following the Stock Acquisition Date (as such time period may be extended pursuant to the Rights Agreement), and (ii) the Final Expiration Date. In addition, the Rights may be exchanged, in whole or in part, for shares of the Common Stock, or shares of preferred stock of the Company having essentially the same value or economic rights as such shares. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing any such exchange, and without any further action or any notice, the Rights (other than Rights which are not subject to such exchange) will terminate and the Rights will only enable holders to receive the shares issuable upon such exchange.
          No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued upon the exercise of any Right or Rights evidenced hereby (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one four-hundredth (1/400th) of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts), but in lieu thereof a cash payment will be made, as provided in the Rights Agreement.
          No holder of this Rights Certificate shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares of Preferred Stock or of any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof, nor shall anything contained in the Rights Agreement or herein be construed to confer upon the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or, to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in the Rights Agreement), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate shall have been exercised as provided in the Rights Agreement.
          This Rights Certificate shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until it shall have been countersigned by the Rights Agent.

Participants who vested in this award are subject to income tax withholding on the value of their restricted stock at the date of vesting. Most participants, including all filers under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are dispo sing of shares to satisfy these tax withholding obligations. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company will record an immaterial charge to earnings related to this accelerated vesting event.

If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.
7. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or in a Preferred Stock Designation, each stockholder will be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the Company on the record date for the meeting and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Corporate Secretary. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Corporate Secretary. The vote upon any question brought before a meeting of the stockholders may be by voice vote, unless otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws or unless the Chairman or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting otherwise determine. Every vote taken by written ballot will be counted by the inspectors of election. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and which has actually been voted will be the act of the stockholders, except in the election of Directors or as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, a Preferred Stock Designation, or by law.
8. Order of Business. (a) The Chairman, or any officer of the Company designated by a majority of the Whole Board, will call meetings of the stockholders to order and will act as presiding officer thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of the stockholders will also determine the order of business and have the authority in his or her sole discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including without limitation by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the Company or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such stockholders' meeting, by ascertaining whether any stockholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of the stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of the stockholders.
(b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the Whole Board, or (iii) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder of the Company in accordance with paragraph (c) of this By-Law 8.
(c) For business to be properly requested to be brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must (i) be a stockholder of the Company of record at the time of the giving of the notice for such annual meeting provided for in these By-Laws, (ii) be entitled to vote at such meeting, and (iii) have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Corporate Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 nor more than 90 calendar days prior to the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is not made at least 75 calendar days prior to the date of the annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10 calendar day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the annual meeting.

The presiding officer of the annual meeting will determine whether or not business was properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this By-Law 8 and, if he or she determines that such business was not properly brought before the meeting, then he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting will not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law 8, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law 8. For purposes of this By-Law and By-Law 13, "public announcement" means disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Nothing in this By-Law 8 will be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock, will be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation.
11. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.

Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director's successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board will shorten the term of an incumbent Director.

To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice must set forth or include (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Company's books, of the stockholder giving the notice and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (ii) a representation that the stockholder giving the notice is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) the class and number of shares of stock of the Company owned beneficially and of record by the stockholder giving the notice and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between or among any of (A) the stockholder giving the notice, (B) the beneficial owner on whose behalf the notice is given, (C) each nominee, and (D) any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder giving the notice; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by the stockholder giving the notice as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (vi) the signed consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. At the request of the Board, any person nominated by the Board for election as a Director must furnish to the Corporate Secretary that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. The presiding officer of the meeting for election of Directors will determine whether or not a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this By-Law 13, and if he or she determines that such nomination was not made in accordance with such procedures, then he or she will so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination will be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law 13, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law 13.

Except for the designation of committees as hereinafter provided and except for actions required by these By-Laws or the Certificate of Incorporation to be taken by a majority of the Whole Board, the act of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of the Board. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time to another place, time, or date, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
18. Participation in Meetings by Telephone Conference. Members of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of the Board or any such committee, as the case may be, by means of telephone conference or similar means by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting will constitute presence in person at the meeting.

The Executive Committee, if one is so designated, will have and may exercise the powers of the Board, except the power to declare dividends, to amend these By-Laws, to elect officers above the office of Vice President, or to rescind or modify any prior action of the Board and except as otherwise provided by law.

The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of such committee. In lieu of such action by the Board, in the absence or upon the disqualification of any member of a committee of the Board, the members thereof present at any such meeting of such committee and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

Any such committee designated by the Board will have such name as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Board, a majority of the members of any committee of the Board will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of such committee. Each committee of the Board may prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings and its method of procedure, subject to any rules prescribed by the Board, and will keep a written record of all actions taken by it.
20.
Compensation. The Board may establish the compensation for, and reimbursement of the expenses of, Directors for membership on the Board and on committees of the Board, attendance at meetings of the Board or committees of the Board, and for other services by Directors to the Company or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries.

Directors Emeritus will receive no fee for their services as Directors Emeritus; however, Directors Emeritus will be entitled to receive retirement and death plan benefits related to their prior service as directors or employees of the Company (provided such benefits are not contingent in any way on continued service). Directors Emeritus shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of expenses for attendance at meetings of the Board.
22. Generally. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-Laws, or the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever by law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws notice is required to be given to any Director or stockholder, it will not be construed to require personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such Director or stockholder, at the address of such Director or stockholder as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice will be deemed to be given on the business day following the day on which the same is deposited in the United States mail. Notice to Directors may also be given by telephone, telegram, telex, facsimile, or similar medium of communication or as otherwise may be permitted by these By-Laws.

Whenever any notice is required to be given by law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, will be deemed equivalent to such notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
24. Generally. The officers of the Company will be elected by the Board and will consist of a Chairman (who, unless the Board specifies otherwise, will also be the Chief Executive Officer), President, a Corporate Secretary, and a Treasurer.

25. Compensation. The compensation of all officers and agents of the Company who are also Directors of the Company will be fixed by the Board or by a committee of the Board. The Board may fix, or delegate the power to fix, the compensation of other officers and agents of the Company to an officer of the Company.
26. Succession. The officers of the Company will hold office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Any officer may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by the Board.

Any such resolution will not apply to shares represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Company, and any such resolution may provide that, notwithstanding the resolution's authorization of uncertificated shares, every holder of stock of the affected class or classes or series represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares of the affected class or classes or series will be entitled to have a certificate representing shares. Certificates representing shares of stock of the Company will be in such form as is determined by the Board, subject to applicable legal requirements. Each such certificate will be numbered and its issuance recorded in the books of the Company, and such certificate will exhibit the holder's name and the number of shares and will be signed by, or in the name of, the Company by the Chairman [or Vice-Chairman or the President or Vice President] and the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, and will also be signed by, or bear the facsimile signature of, a duly authorized officer or agent of any properly designated transfer agent of the Company.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series will be identical.
30. Transfers. Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the Company of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer, it will be the duty of the Company to issue, or to cause its transfer agent to issue, a new certificate or, if the issuance of uncertificated shares has been duly authorized for the class or series represented by such surrendered certificate, uncertificated shares to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction upon its books.
31. Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. The Corporate Secretary may direct a new certificate or certificates or, if the issuance of uncertificated shares has been duly authorized for the relevant class or series, uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, satisfactory to the Corporate Secretary, by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares, the Corporate Secretary may require the owners of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate to give the Company a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Corporate Secretary may direct as indemnity against any claims that may be made against the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed or the issuance of the new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares.

(a) In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which will not be more than 60 nor less than 10 calendar days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders will be at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders will apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date will not be more than 60 calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose will be at the close of business on the calendar day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(c) The Company will be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, and will not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Company has notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.
33. Damages and Expenses. (a) Without limiting the generality or effect of Article Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect indemnify any person (an "Indemnitee") who is or was involved in any manner (including without limitation as a party or a witness) or is threatened to be made so involved in any threatened, pending, or completed investigation, claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including without limitation any action, suit, or proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) (a "Proceeding") by reason of the fact that such person is or was or had agreed to become a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Board or an officer of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other entity, whether for profit or not for profit (including the heirs, executors, administrators, or estate of such person), or anything done or not by such person in any such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. Such indemnification will be a contract right and will include the right to receive payment in advance of any expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law as then in effect.
(b) The right of indemnification provided in this By-Law 33 will not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled, and will be applicable to Proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this By-Law 33, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption.
(c) In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions, and remedies will apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this By-Law 33:
(i) All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding will be advanced to the Indemnitee by the Company within 30 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements will reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if and to the extent required by law at the time of such advance, will include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amounts advanced as to which it may ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled. If such an undertaking is required by law at the time of an advance, no security will be required for such undertaking and such undertaking will be accepted without reference to the recipient's financial ability to make repayment.
(ii) To obtain indemnification under this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will submit to the Corporate Secretary a written request, including such documentation supporting the claim as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "Supporting Documentation"). The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification will be made not more than 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Corporate Secretary will promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification advise the Board in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this By-Law 33 will be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), if they constitute a quorum of the Board, or, in the case of an Indemnitee that is not a present or former officer of the Company, by any committee of the Board or committee of officers or agents of the Company designated for such purpose by a majority of the Whole Board; (B) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel if (1) a Change of Control has occurred and the Indemnitee so requests or (2) in the case of an Indemnitee that is a present or former officer of the Company, a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (C) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (D) as provided in subparagraph (iii) below. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to clause (B) above, a majority of the Disinterested Directors will select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control has occurred, the Indemnitee will select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Board does not reasonably object.
(iii) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33 upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with subparagraph (c) (ii) above, and thereafter the Company will have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under subparagraph (c) (ii) to determine entitlement to indemnification has not been appointed or has not made a determination within 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee will be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the Indemnitee will be entitled to such indemnification unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding described in paragraph (a) of this By-Law 33, or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was not unlawful.
(iv) (A) In the event that a determination is made pursuant to subparagraph (c) (ii) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33, (1) the Indemnitee will be entitled to seek an adjudication of his or her entitlement to such indemnification either, at the Indemnitee's sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (2) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration will be de novo and the Indemnitee will not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (3) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration the Company will have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this By-Law 33.
(B) If a determination is made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) or (iii) of this By-Law 33 that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company will be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five business days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and will be conclusively bound by such determination unless (1) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (2) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i) of this By-Law 33 or payment of indemnification is not made within five business days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) or (iii) of this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Company's obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of any event described in subclause (1) or (2) of this clause (B) (a "Disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such action the Company will have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.
(C) The Company will be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (c)(iv) that the procedures and presumptions of this By-Law 33 are not valid, binding, and enforceable and will stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this By-Law 33.
(D) In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (c)(iv), seeks a judicial adjudication of, or an award in arbitration to enforce, his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this By-Law 33, the Indemnitee will be entitled to recover from the Company, and will be indemnified by the Company against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it is determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration will be prorated accordingly.
(v) For purposes of this paragraph (c):
(A) "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events:
(1) The Company is merged, consolidated, or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal entity, and as a result of such merger, consolidation, or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of such corporation or entity immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of the Voting Stock immediately prior to such transaction;
(2) The Company sells or otherwise transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation or other legal entity and, as a result of such sale or transfer, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such other corporation or entity immediately after such sale or transfer is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock immediately prior to such sale or transfer;
(3) There is a report filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Voting Stock;
(4) The Company files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein) that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(5) If, during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the Directors cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (5) each Director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by the Company's stockholders, by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors (or a committee of the Board) then still in office who were Directors at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a Director at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of clauses (3) or (4) of this paragraph (c)(v)(A), unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" will not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of such clauses (3) or (4) solely because (x) the Company, (y) an entity in which the Company, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities (a "Subsidiary"), or (z) any employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K, or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form, or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 20% or otherwise, or because the Company reports that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
(B) "Disinterested Director" means a Director of the Company who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.
(C) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm or a member of a law firm that neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent (1) the Company or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (2) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this By-Law 33. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" will not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing under the law of the State of Delaware, would be precluded from representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights under this By-Law 33.
(d) If any provision or provisions of this By-Law 33 are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this By-Law 33 (including without limitation all portions of any paragraph of this By-Law 33 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this By-Law 33 (including without limitation all portions of any paragraph of this By-Law 33 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.
34. Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Indemnitee against any expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement or incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding referred to in By-Law 33 or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect. The Company may enter into contracts with any person entitled to indemnification under By-Law 33 or otherwise, and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest, or use other means (including without limitation a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in By-Law 33.
35. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Company will end on December 31 or such date as may be fixed from time to time by the Board.
36. Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal and use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
37. Reliance upon Books, Reports, and Records. Each Director, each member of a committee designated by the Board, and each officer of the Company will, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports, or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company's officers or employees, or committees of the Board, or by any other person or entity as to matters the Director, committee member, or officer believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company.
38. Time Periods. In applying any provision of these By-Laws that requires that an act be done or not be done a specified number of days prior to an event or that an act be done during a period of a specified number of days prior to an event, calendar days will be used unless otherwise specified, the day of the doing of the act will be excluded and the day of the event will be included.
39. Amendments. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws or any of them may be amended in any respect or repealed at any time, either (i) at any meeting of stockholders, provided that any amendment or supplement proposed to be acted upon at any such meeting has been described or referred to in the notice of such meeting, or (ii) at any meeting of the Board, provided that no amendment adopted by the Board may vary or conflict with any amendment adopted by the stockholders.

Environmental Matters
Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2006 the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites. The Company is identified as a "de minimis" party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 11 of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the three remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company's expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations. For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low-end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates,and the amounts accrued in the financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the financial statements. In estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations. Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $28.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively. In 2006, the Company provided $23.0 million of additional reserves, including $0.8 million for existing sites and $22.2 million related to the recent acquisitions of HCC ($21.2 million) and Land Instruments ($1.0 million). The additional reserves related to the recent acquisitions were recorded through purchase accounting and did not affect the Company's income statement. The Company spent $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, on such environmental matters in 2006 and 2005. The Company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, including HCC, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. In the case of HCC, the Company has assumed the liability for the performance of all required remedial activities at the site and has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs for the required remedial activities. The Company has recorded a total of $15.8 million of receivables in its balance sheet related to the HCC matter for probable recoveries from third party escrow funds and other committed third party funds to support the required remediation as well as a deferred tax benefit of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company is indemnified by HCC's former owners for up to $19.0 million of additional costs. The Company and some of the other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their obligations in all material respects. The Company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Paoli, PA, January 25, 2008  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced that its Board of Directors has increased the authorized level for repurchases of its common stock by $50 million. This increased authorization will be added to the approximately $26 million that remains available from an existing $50 million authorization approved by the Board of Directors in March 2003. Today's action brings the total amount authorized for share repurchases to approximately $76 million.
Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "With this increased authorization, AMETEK will continue its strategy of making opportunistic purchases of its common stock to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans. We will continue to allocate our strong free cash flow towards strategic acquisitions and, in their absence, debt reduction. Stock repurchases will remain a modest use of that free cash flow."
In 2007 the Company repurchased approximately 144,000 shares of its common stock for a total cost of approximately $5.4 million. The Company has not repurchased any common stock during 2008.

Paoli, PA, May 19, 2008  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) announces the performance-based, accelerated vesting of its April 27, 2005 restricted stock grant as a result of the doubling of its common stock price in the three years since the issuance of the grant. The performance vesting of this restricted stock grant reflects the significant value that has been created for AMETEK's shareholders.
AMETEK's restricted stock grants provide for immediate vesting if the closing price of its common stock during any five consecutive trading days reaches 200% of the price of its common stock on the date the restricted stock award was granted.
The April 27, 2005 restricted stock awards were granted at AMETEK's closing price of $25.05 (on a split adjusted basis) and were subject to immediate vesting if AMETEK's common stock closed at or above $50.10 for five consecutive trading days. This grant, which totaled 706,605 shares, achieved the market performance vesting target on May 16, 2008 when AMETEK's common stock price closed at $52.98, its fifth consecutive trading day closing at or above $50.10.
In the second quarter, the Company will record an after tax, non-cash charge of approximately $6.9 million, or approximately $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the impact of this event. As a result, earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2008 is now $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share, as compared to the Company's previous guidance of $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share. Similarly, earnings guidance for full-year 2008 is now $2.42 to $2.47 per diluted share, as compared with previous guidance of $2.47 to $2.52, reflecting the $0.06 per diluted share in additional expense noted above, offset by $0.01 per diluted share of lower prospective restricted stock expense in the second half of 2008.
Participants vested in this award are subject to income tax withholding on the value of their restricted stock at the date of vesting. Most participants, including all executive officers required to file under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are disposing of shares to satisfy these tax withholding obligations. Shares disposed of by participants will be acquired directly by AMETEK in non open-market transactions.

Paoli, PA, July 21, 2008  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced second quarter results that established second quarter records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's second quarter 2008 sales of $648.8 million were up 25% over the same period of 2007. Operating income for the second quarter of 2008 was $114.1 million, an 18% increase from the $96.6 million recorded in the same period of 2007. Net income in the second quarter of 2008 increased 13% to $65.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, from the second quarter 2007 level of $58.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share.
This year's second quarter earnings include an after-tax, non-cash, charge of $7.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to the performance-based accelerated vesting of restricted stock. Performance-based vesting occurred as a result of the stock price doubling in the three years since the issue of the grant, reflecting the significant value created for AMETEK shareholders.
Excluding this charge, operating income would have been $121.9 million, or 18.8% of sales, up 26% over the $96.6 million or 18.6% of sales reported in the second quarter of 2007. Similarly, net income would have increased 26% to $73.1 million and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.68, up 26% over the same period of last year.
"AMETEK had an outstanding quarter which exceeded our expectations," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Excellent internal growth, combined with the contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow the top-line by 25%. We delivered strong growth in earnings, driven by the top-line growth and our operational excellence initiatives," he commented.
Operating cash flow was excellent, totaling $142 million in the first half of 2008, up 18% from last year's first half.
For the first half of 2008, AMETEK sales increased 23% to $1.26 billion from $1.02 billion in the same period of 2007. Operating income totaled $230.3 million, a 23% increase from $186.5 million earned in the first half of last year. Net income for the first half of 2008 was $132.2 million, up 21% from $108.9 million in the same period of 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $1.23 for the first half of 2008, up 21% from $1.02 per diluted share in the first half of 2007.

Excluding the charge related to the accelerated restricted stock vesting noted above, operating income for the first half of 2008 would have totaled $238.1 million, or 18.9% of sales, up 28% over the $186.5 million, or 18.2% of sales, reported in the same period of 2007. Similarly, net income would have been up 28% to $139.5 million and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.30, up 27% over the same period of 2007.
For the 2008 second quarter, EIG sales increased 22% to $343.1 million. Operating income was $78.1 million, compared with $62.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 26%. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 22.8%, from 22.1% in the second quarter of 2007.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG had a great second quarter. Sales were up on excellent core growth driven by our process and analytical, power and aerospace businesses together with the contribution from the Cameca, California Instruments, Advanced Industries, B&S Aircraft Parts and Vision Research acquisitions. Operating margins expanded 70 basis points, benefiting from the top-line growth as well as from operational excellence improvements," said Mr. Hermance.
For the second quarter of 2008, EMG sales were $305.7 million, a 29% increase over the same period of 2007. Operating income of $53.1 million was up 21% from the $43.7 million recorded in the same period of 2007. Operating margins for the quarter were 17.4%, as compared with 18.4% in the second quarter of 2007.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG also had a great second quarter. Sales were up on solid core growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Reading Alloys, Umeco Repair and Overhaul, Drake Air, Motion Control Group, Hamilton Precision Metals, and Seacon Phoenix. Operating income increased as a result of the increased volume and our operational excellence initiatives," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Given the strong conditions in our key markets and the solid second quarter results, we are raising our earnings estimate for the year from our previous guidance of $2.42 to $2.47 per diluted share, to approximately $2.50 to $2.54 per diluted share, an increase of 18% to 20% over the 2007 level of $2.12 per diluted share. Revenue is estimated to be up approximately 20% over 2007," commented Mr. Hermance.
2008 Outlook
"Our third quarter 2008 sales are expected to be up approximately 20% from last year's third quarter. We expect third quarter earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 15% to 19% over last year's third quarter level of $0.53 per diluted share," concluded Mr. Hermance.

Paoli, PA, July 24, 2008  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced that its Board of Directors has increased the authorized level for repurchases of its common stock by $50 million. This increased authorization will be added to the approximately $18 million that remains available from an existing $50 million authorization approved by the Board of Directors in January 2008. Today's action brings the total amount authorized for share repurchases to approximately $68 million.
Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "With this increased authorization, AMETEK will continue its strategy of making opportunistic purchases of its common stock to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans. We will continue to allocate our strong free cash flow towards strategic acquisitions and, in their absence, debt reduction. Stock repurchases will remain a modest use of that free cash flow."
During 2008 the Company has repurchased approximately 1.26 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of approximately $57.4 million.

Its products are used in design verification testing, manufacturing, quality assurance and regulatory compliance by its customers in a wide range of industries; including aviation, military, and general electronics.

Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including, but not limited to, interest accrued thereon at the Default Rate), (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), and (z) interest accrued at the Default Rate on any overdue payment of Make-Whole Amount in accordance with the terms of the Notes, in each case shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
12.2. Other Remedies.
If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.
12.3. Rescission.
At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the Majority Holders, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (a) the Company has paid or deposited pursuant to trust arrangements acceptable to the Majority Holders all overdue interest on any Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) neither the Company nor any other Person shall have paid any amounts which have become due solely by reason of such declaration, (c) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than the non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (d) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
12.4. No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc.

No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

(b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
within ten Business Days thereafter the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note of the same series, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by a Purchaser or its nominee, such Purchaser will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by a Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as the Purchasers have made in this Section 14.2.

17.1. Requirements.
This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the Majority Holders and, prior to the earlier of the Second Closing Date and the date the Purchasers have no further obligation to purchase Notes hereunder, a majority (by principal amount of their intended purchase hereunder) of the Purchasers in respect of any Notes which have not been issued at such time except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any Purchaser unless consented to by such Purchaser in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate of interest or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.
17.2. Solicitation of Holders of Notes.
(a) The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

Payment.
17.3. Binding Effect, etc.
Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.
this Agreement
17.4. Notes Held by Company, etc.
Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

The Company agrees and stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

Each Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures adopted by such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to such Purchaser, provided that such Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment represented by its Notes), (ii) its financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree or whose duties require them to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which it sells or offers to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person from which it offers to purchase any Security of the Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Purchaser, (vii) the NAIC or any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about such Purchaser's investment portfolio, or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under such Purchaser's Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement.

Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Affiliate as a "Purchaser" in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.
22.1. Successors and Assigns.
All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including without limitation any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.
22.2. Construction.
Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
22.3. Jurisdiction and Process.
(a) The Company irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the Notes.

(d) THE COMPANY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH.
(e) Any payment on account of an amount that is payable hereunder or under the Notes by the Company that is made to or for the account of any holder of Notes in any currency other than the currency specified for such payment, whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of the Company, shall constitute a discharge of the Company's obligation under this Agreement or any Note only to the extent of the amount of Dollars that such holder (i) could purchase in the foreign exchange markets in New York, New York with the amount of such other currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the day (other than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in New York, New York) following receipt of the payment first referred to above or (ii) purchases pursuant to such holder's regular banking arrangements at the time with respect to payments received in a currency other than Dollars.

The Company agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of any such currency deficiency.

22.4. Payments Due on Non-Business Days.
Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirements in Section 8 that notices in respect of prepayments specify a Business Day as the date fixed for such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount (if any) or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.
22.5. Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

22.7. Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.
22.8. Governing Law.
This Agreement and the Notes shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.

Paoli, PA, October 21, 2008  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced third quarter results that established third quarter records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's third quarter 2008 sales of $647.4 million were up 22% over the same period of 2007.

"AMETEK had another outstanding quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong internal growth, combined with the contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow the top-line by 22%. We delivered strong growth in earnings, driven by the top-line growth and our operational excellence initiatives," he commented.

Paoli, PA, January 14, 2009  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it expects fourth quarter 2008 adjusted earnings, which excludes a restructuring charge, will be approximately $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of 16% over the $0.57 per diluted share earned in the fourth quarter of 2007, and in line with guidance given on October 21, 2008 of $0.66  $0.68 per diluted share.
In the fourth quarter, AMETEK will record a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $38  $40 million, or $0.24  $0.26 per diluted share, to cover the costs of employee reductions, facility closures and asset write-downs necessary to realign the Company's cost structure with expected market conditions. These actions and other cost reduction activities are expected to result in 2009 savings of approximately $75 million. The benefits from the restructuring activities will have a greater impact in the latter half of the year.
For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share, including the impact of this fourth quarter 2008 restructuring charge is anticipated to be approximately $0.40  $0.42, compared to $0.57 per diluted share earned in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented, "Reflecting the global economic downturn, order rates for our businesses slowed dramatically in November and December. We expect difficult economic conditions to persist in 2009 and have taken these cost reduction actions to appropriately align our cost structure with expected market conditions."
Adjusted earnings for the full year 2008, excluding the restructuring charge, are expected to be approximately $2.55 per diluted share, an increase of 20% over the same period of 2007.

"We expect 2009 to be a very challenging year given the continuing global economic downturn, though we believe that AMETEK's strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, a lower cost structure, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to outperform in 2009," noted Mr. Hermance.
2009 Outlook
"Based on our current understanding of market conditions, which has a more than normal level of uncertainty, we anticipate 2009 revenue to be down slightly from 2008 on a reported basis, reflecting the full year impact of our 2008 acquisitions, negative foreign currency headwinds and mid-single digit negative internal growth. Earnings for 2009 are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per diluted share," added Mr. Hermance.

Paoli, PA, January 30, 2009  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced fourth quarter and full year results.
AMETEK's fourth quarter 2008 sales of $623.7 million were up 7% over the same period of 2007. Net income, which includes the impact of a fourth quarter restructuring charge, was $43.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.41, compared to $0.57 per diluted share earned in the fourth quarter of 2007.
For the full year 2008, AMETEK achieved sales of $2.53 billion, up 18% from 2007. Including the impact of the fourth quarter restructuring charge, net income for the full year 2008 was $247.0 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.30, compared to $2.12 per diluted share earned in 2007.
In the fourth quarter, AMETEK recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million ($27.3 million, net of tax), or $0.25 per diluted share, to cover the costs of employee reductions, facility closures and asset write-downs necessary to realign the Company's cost structure with expected market conditions. These actions and other cost reduction activities are expected to result in 2009 savings of approximately $75 million. The benefits from the restructuring activities will have a greater impact in the second half of the year.
Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which excludes the restructuring charge, increased 15% to $71.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, as compared to fourth quarter 2007 net income of $61.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. For the full year, adjusted earnings were $274.2 million or $2.55 per diluted share, a 20% increase in both measures from 2007.
"Reflecting the global economic downturn, order rates for our businesses slowed dramatically in November and December. We expect difficult economic conditions to persist in 2009 and have taken these cost reduction actions to appropriately align our cost structure with expected market conditions," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Despite these difficult economic conditions, AMETEK had a very good fourth quarter," added Mr. Hermance. "The contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow our top-line by 7% for the quarter, offsetting a weakening core growth environment. Operating income margin, excluding the restructuring charge, was up 180 basis points and diluted earnings per share were up 16% in the quarter, driven by our top-line growth and operational excellence improvements," he commented.

AMETEK ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
For the 2008 fourth quarter, EIG sales increased 8% to $361.6 million. Operating income, including the impact of the restructuring charge of $20.4 million, was $69.2 million, compared with $73.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of 5%.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
Operating income, excluding the restructuring charge, was $89.6 million, compared with $73.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 23%. Operating margins for the quarter improved to 24.8%, from 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
"EIG had a very good fourth quarter. Sales were up 8%, driven by our power and process instrument businesses, together with the contributions from our Vision Research, Xantrex Programmable Power and California Instrument acquisitions. Core growth weakened in the quarter. Operating margins, excluding the restructuring charge, expanded 300 basis points," said Mr. Hermance.
For the 2008 fourth quarter, EMG sales increased 6% to $262.1 million. Operating income, including the impact of the restructuring charge of $19.4 million, was $24.7 million, compared with $42.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
Operating income, excluding the restructuring charge, was $44.1 million, compared with $42.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 4%. Operating margins for the quarter were 16.8%, as compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
"EMG had a good fourth quarter, considering the economic environment. Sales were up on the contributions from the acquisitions of Reading Alloys, Muirhead Aerospace, Drake Air, Motion Control Group and Umeco Repair and Overhaul, more than offsetting difficult market conditions for our cost-driven motor businesses. Operating margins, before the restructuring charge, were down 40 basis points reflecting the impact of the economic downturn," commented Mr. Hermance.
"We expect 2009 to be a very challenging year given the continuing global economic downturn, though we believe that AMETEK's strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to outperform in 2009," noted Mr. Hermance.
2009 Outlook
"Based on our current understanding of market conditions, which has a more than normal level of uncertainty, we anticipate 2009 revenue to be down slightly from 2008, reflecting the full year impact of our 2008 acquisitions, negative foreign currency headwinds and mid-single digit negative internal growth. Earnings for 2009 are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per diluted share," added Mr. Hermance.

AMETEK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
"Given the state of the economy, EMG also had a good first quarter. Not surprisingly, our Cost Driven Motor business struggled in the current economic environment. Sales in the Differentiated businesses were up due to the benefits from acquired businesses. Operating margins were up 100 basis points as a result of very effective operational excellence and cost reduction initiatives in the Differentiated businesses as well as the Cost Driven Motor business," commented Mr. Hermance.
"We expect 2009 to be a very challenging year. As a result of the continuing global economic downturn, revenue is now expected to decline approximately 10%," commented Mr. Hermance. "We expect our earnings for the year to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25 per diluted share. Included in our estimates are an additional $20 million in cost reductions which augment the $75 million in cost reductions announced after the end of 2008."
2009 Outlook
"Second quarter 2009 sales are expected to be down in the mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year's second quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share," noted Mr. Hermance.
Mr. Hermance continued, "AMETEK has successfully navigated difficult market conditions before. We are focused on executing our restructuring initiatives, generating strong cash flow and solid financial results. We continue to invest in new products, global expansion and strategic acquisitions to position ourselves for an economic upturn when it occurs."

Paoli, PA, January 26, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced fourth quarter results that reflected sequentially higher sales, improved profitability, excellent cash flow and strong orders.
AMETEK's fourth quarter 2009 sales of $523.5 million were down 16% over the same period of 2008. Operating income was $89.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $82.2 million in the same period of 2008. Net income was $51.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to net income of $43.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, earned in the fourth quarter of 2008.
"AMETEK had a good fourth quarter, despite still difficult market conditions. As anticipated, we saw sequentially higher sales in a number of key markets, improved earnings and continued excellent cash flow generation. Perhaps most importantly, we saw significantly higher order rates from our customers," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 were strong, totaling $577 million, a 20% sequential improvement over the third quarter of 2009 and a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter operating income margins expanded 140 basis points to 17.0%.
Operating cash flow was excellent for both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $109 million, up 155% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, operating cash flow was $365 million, up 47% from 2008.
For the full year 2009, AMETEK achieved sales of $2.1 billion, down 17% from 2008. Operating income in 2009 was $366.1 million compared with $432.7 million last year. Net income for the full year 2009 was $205.8 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, compared to net income of $247.0 million, or $2.30 per diluted share earned in 2008.
Fourth quarter and full year 2008 results include a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million ($27.3 million, net of tax), or $0.25 per diluted share, to cover the costs of employee reductions, facility closures and asset write-downs necessary to realign the Company's cost structure. The attached income statement and segment information tables detail 2008 results both with and without this restructuring charge.

AMETEK ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
For the 2009 fourth quarter, EIG sales decreased 21% to $286.0 million. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $56.1 million, compared with $69.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the fourth quarter of 2009, operating margins were 19.6% as compared with 19.1% in last year's fourth quarter.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG performed well in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, sequential sales of instruments for research and metals applications improved, while our oil and gas related instrument businesses stabilized. Sequential orders for EIG were up low double digits. Operating margins were strong at 19.6%, expanding 200 basis points sequentially from the third quarter of this year," said Mr. Hermance.
For the 2009 fourth quarter, EMG sales declined 9% to $237.5 million. Operating income was $40.7 million, compared with $24.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating margins were 17.1% as compared with 9.4% in last year's fourth quarter.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG also performed well in the fourth quarter. Sequential sales improved in both our cost driven motor and differentiated businesses. Sequential orders in EMG were up approximately 30% in the quarter. Operating margins rose to 17.1%, a 10 basis point sequential improvement," commented Mr. Hermance.
"We expect our markets overall to show modest growth during 2010, with this growth becoming more evident as we move through the year. We believe that AMETEK's strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to perform well in 2010," noted Mr. Hermance.
2010 Outlook
"We anticipate 2010 revenue to be up low to mid single digits on a percentage basis from 2009. Earnings for 2010 are expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20 per diluted share, up 10% to 15% over 2009, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our streamlined cost structure," added Mr. Hermance.
"First quarter 2010 sales are expected to be down mid single digits on a percentage basis from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.47 per diluted share, as compared to last year's first quarter of $0.55," concluded Mr. Hermance.

Paoli, PA, January 29, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced that its Board of Directors has increased the authorized level for repurchases of its common stock by $75 million. This increased authorization will be added to the approximately $68 million that remains available from an existing authorization approved by the Board of Directors in July 2008. Today's action brings the total amount authorized for share repurchases to approximately $143 million.
Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "With this increased authorization, AMETEK will continue its strategy of making opportunistic purchases of its common stock to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans. We will continue to allocate our strong free cash flow towards strategic acquisitions and, in their absence, debt reduction. Stock repurchases will remain a modest use of that free cash flow."

Paoli, PA, April 21, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it expects its first quarter results to substantially exceed its prior guidance. The Company now expects first quarter diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.53 to $0.54, up from its previous guidance of $0.45 to $0.47 per diluted share.
"AMETEK had a strong quarter that surpassed our expectations," stated Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

As a result, earnings are expected to be significantly above our previous guidance, with diluted earnings per share up 10% to 13% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009," he commented.
"Given our strong first quarter results and cautious optimism for the balance of the year, we have raised our full year 2010 estimated earnings to a range of $2.20 to $2.28 per diluted share, up from our previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 per diluted share. We now estimate our second quarter earnings to be between $0.53 and $0.55 per diluted share," stated Mr. Hermance.

Paoli, PA, April 27, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced first quarter results that reflected sequentially higher orders, sales and profitability.
"We are very pleased with our results this quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We performed much better than anticipated with broad based strength in many of our markets. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, first quarter sales were up 6%, operating margins expanded by 140 basis points and diluted earnings per share were up 13%. As compared to the strong performance in the first quarter of 2009 which was driven by our higher margin, longer cycle businesses, the results in this year's first quarter are impressive."
Orders were particularly strong at $582 million, up 19% over the first quarter of 2009. Sales of $556.7 million were up 1% over the first quarter of 2009 and operating income was $102.4 million, a 4% decrease from $106.2 million recorded in the same period of 2009. Net income was $57.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, as compared to the first quarter 2009 level of $59.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share.
"EIG performed well in the first quarter with sequential sales up 4% driven by strength in our Power and Process businesses. Operating margins were exceptional at 23.1%, expanding 350 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year," said Mr. Hermance.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
For the 2010 first quarter, EIG sales were $298.7 million, a 1% decrease from the same period of 2009. Operating income was unchanged at $69.1 million when compared to first quarter of 2009. Operating margins for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 23.1%. Orders were very strong, up 17% over the first quarter of 2009.
"EMG also performed well in the first quarter. Sequential sales improved 9% with broad based improvements in our shorter cycle cost driven motor and differentiated businesses. Operating margins were down 30 basis points with the strong growth in our lower margin cost driven motor business," commented Mr. Hermance.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
For the first quarter of 2010, EMG sales were $258.0 million, a 3% increase over the same period of 2009. Operating income of $43.4 million was down 6% from the $46.2 million recorded in the same period of 2009 and operating margins for the quarter were 16.8%.

Paoli, PA, July 21, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced it expects its second quarter results to substantially exceed its prior guidance. The Company now expects second quarter diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.62 to $0.63, up from its previous guidance of $0.53 to $0.55 per diluted share. Second quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 13% over the $524.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
"AMETEK had a strong quarter that surpassed our expectations," stated Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Orders in the quarter were up approximately 30% with broad-based strength evident in most of our markets. This order strength translated into strong top-line performance and, coupled with a lower cost structure, drove the excellent bottom-line performance. Earnings are expected to be significantly above our previous guidance, with diluted earnings per share up 29% to 31% over the second quarter of 2009."
"Our markets overall continue to show good growth as evidenced by our strong order input this year. While we remain watchful for any effects to our business from a slowing global economy, we are not experiencing any impact at this point. Given our strong second quarter results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year, we have raised our full year 2010 estimated earnings to a range of $2.43 to $2.47 per diluted share, up from our previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.28 per diluted share. Our revised guidance represents a 27% to 29% improvement over 2009. Earnings for the third quarter are expected to be between $0.63 and $0.65 per diluted share," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Included in our revised estimates are the impacts of the Haydon Enterprises acquisition announced on July 1, 2010 and benefits from a better than expected tax rate for the remainder of the year," stated Mr. Hermance.
A more comprehensive review of second quarter results and the full year 2010 forecast will be discussed in the Company's second quarter earnings release and conference call scheduled for July 27, 2010.

"AMETEK achieved excellent results in the second quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Orders in the quarter were up 33% with broad-based strength evident in most of our markets. This order strength translated into strong top-line performance and, coupled with a lower cost structure, drove earnings significantly above our expectations."
For the first half of 2010, AMETEK sales increased 7% to $1.15 billion from $1.08 billion in the same period of 2009. Operating income increased 9% to $218.0 million, from $199.4 million earned in the first half of last year.

AMETEK ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
"EMG also had a very good quarter. Sales were up on strong core growth in both our differentiated and cost driven businesses as well as the contributions from the Ameron and Technical Services for Electronics acquisitions. Operating margins improved by 110 basis points, driven by higher revenue and our lowered cost structure," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Our markets overall continue to show good growth as evidenced by our strong order input this year. While we remain watchful for any effects to our business from a slowing global economy, we are not experiencing any impact at this point. We continue to believe that AMETEK's strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to perform well in 2010," noted Mr. Hermance.
2010 Outlook
"We now anticipate 2010 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2009, reflecting a stronger core growth environment and the impact of recent acquisitions. Earnings for 2010 are expected to be in the range of $2.43 to $2.47 per diluted share, up 27% to 29% over 2009, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our streamlined cost structure and the bottom-line benefit of acquisitions, including the recently acquired Haydon Enterprises business. This guidance is in-line with our announcement last week and up significantly from our April guidance of $2.20 to $2.28 per diluted share," added Mr. Hermance.
"Third quarter 2010 sales are expected to be up high teens on a percentage basis from last year's third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.65 per diluted share, up 58% to 63% over the third quarter of 2009," noted Mr. Hermance.

2009 10-K Excerpt
Environmental Matters
Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2009, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the "non-owned" sites). The Company is identified as a "de minimis" party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company's expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the "owned" sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company's liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.
Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $27.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively, for non-owned and owned sites. In 2009, the Company received $1.3 million of additional reserves from a third party for existing sites. Additionally, the Company spent $2.7 million on environmental matters in 2009. The Company's reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 include reserves of $19.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries ("HCC"). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $13.9 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC's former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.
The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the following paragraph.
In August 2009, the Company agreed to a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board regarding the 2008 Notice of Administrative Civil Liability related to a former subsidiary which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, whereby the Company paid and deferred minor penalties, which were covered by previously established reserves.
The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Paoli, PA, October 26, 2010  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced third quarter results that established records for operating income, operating income margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow.
AMETEK's third quarter 2010 sales of $644.4 million were up 30% over the $497.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2009. Operating income for the third quarter of 2010 was $128.6 million, a 66% increase from $77.5 million recorded in the same period of 2009. Operating income margin in the quarter of 20.0% was a 440 basis point improvement over last year's third quarter level. Net income in the third quarter of 2010 increased 80% to $77.4 million, from $43.0 million in the year ago period. Diluted earnings per share increased 80% to $0.72 per diluted share, from the third quarter 2009 level of $0.40 per diluted share.
"AMETEK achieved excellent results in the third quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Orders in the quarter were up 47% with broad-based strength evident in most of our markets. This order strength translated into strong top-line performance and, coupled with a lower cost structure, drove earnings significantly above our expectations."
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record at $114 million, up 59% over the third quarter of last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, AMETEK sales increased 14% to $1.79 billion from $1.57 billion in the same period of 2009. Operating income increased 25% to $346.6 million, from $276.9 million earned in the first nine months of last year. Net income for the nine months of 2010 was $202.7 million, up 32% from $153.9 million in the same period of 2009.

Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)

For the third quarter of 2010, EMG sales were $306.7 million, a 36% increase over the same period of 2009. Operating income of $55.8 million was up 46% from the $38.2 million recorded in the same period of 2009. Operating margins for the quarter were up 120 basis points to 18.2%, as compared to 17.0% in the third quarter of 2009.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG also had a very good quarter. Sales were up on strong core growth in both our differentiated and cost driven businesses as well as the contributions from the Haydon Enterprises, Technical Services for Electronics and Ameron acquisitions. Operating margins improved by 120 basis points, driven by higher revenue and our lowered cost structure," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Our markets overall continue to show good growth as evidenced by our strong order input this year. We continue to believe that AMETEK's strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to perform well in 2010," noted Mr. Hermance.
2010 Outlook
"We now anticipate 2010 revenue to be up mid teens on a percentage basis from 2009, reflecting a stronger core growth environment and the impact of recent acquisitions. Earnings guidance for 2010 has been increased and is now expected to be in the range of $2.57 to $2.59 per diluted share, up 35% to 36% over 2009, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our streamlined cost structure and the bottom-line benefit of acquisitions. This is a substantial increase over our prior guidance, issued in July, of $2.43 to $2.47 per diluted share," added Mr. Hermance.
"Fourth quarter 2010 sales are expected to be up approximately 20% from last year's fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.68 to $0.70 per diluted share, up 42% to 46% over the fourth quarter of 2009," noted Mr. Hermance.

Operating margins were up nicely on the higher revenues and our lowered cost structure," commented Mr. Hermance.
"We expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2011, with our longer cycle oil and gas, power and aerospace business showing particular strength. Our record backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2011," noted Mr. Hermance.
2011 Outlook
"We anticipate 2011 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2010. Earnings for 2011 are expected to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.07 per diluted share on a post-split basis, up 14% to 18% over 2010, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our streamlined cost structure," added Mr. Hermance.
"First quarter 2011 sales are expected to be up high teens on a percentage basis from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.46 to $0.48 per diluted share on a post-split basis, an increase of 28% to 33% over last year's first quarter of $0.36," concluded Mr. Hermance.

"AMETEK had a strong quarter that surpassed our expectations," stated Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Orders in the quarter were up approximately 37% with broad-based strength evident in most of our markets. This order strength translated into strong top-line performance and, coupled with a lower cost structure, drove the excellent bottom-line performance. Earnings are expected to be significantly above our previous guidance, with diluted earnings per share up 53% to 56% over the first quarter of 2010. These results will establish quarterly records for orders, sales and diluted earnings per share."
"Our markets overall continue to show excellent growth as evidenced by our strong order input this year. Given the strong first quarter results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year, we have raised our full year 2011 estimated earnings to a range of $2.20 to $2.25 per diluted share, up from our previous guidance of $2.00 to $2.07 per diluted share. Our revised guidance represents a 25% to 28% improvement over 2010," commented Mr. Hermance.
Earnings for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.53 and $0.55 per diluted share.
Included in both the full year and second quarter guidance is $0.02 per diluted share of costs associated with the performance-based, accelerated vesting of restricted stock, which resulted from a doubling of our stock price since the April 23, 2009 grant date.

Operating income was $152.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $102.4 million in the same period of 2010.

Diluted earnings per share increased 56% to $0.56 per diluted share, from the first quarter 2010 level of $0.36 per diluted share.

Sales were up 29% on the strength of the order input and the contributions from the acquisitions completed last year. Our focus on Operational Excellence, coupled with the higher sales, resulted in record earnings and margins for the quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 22, 2011, AMETEK, Inc. (the "Company") along with certain of the Company's subsidiaries, as borrowers (the "Borrowers"), entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with the lenders from time to time party hereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association, SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents. The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's existing $450 million credit facility, which was due to expire in June 2012.
The Credit Agreement consists of a five-year revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $700 million with a final maturity date of September 22, 2016. The Revolving Credit Facility has available up to $100 million for issuance of Letters of Credit, the equivalent of up to $450 million for Foreign Currency borrowings and an expansion feature amount of up to $200 million.
Proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for working capital, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Company and certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries may be borrowers under the Credit Agreement. Loans may be made, and letters of credit may be issued, under the Credit Agreement in U.S. Dollars and other agreed currencies. The obligations of any subsidiary borrowers are guaranteed by the Company.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the Company's Leverage Ratio. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months.
The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that the Company believes are usual and customary for senior unsecured credit agreements, including compliance with various financial ratios and tests, and certain covenants that restrict, among other things, the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to incur debt; incur liens; merge or consolidate with other companies and make certain acquisitions.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the representations or warranties in any material respect; breach of the financial, affirmative or negative covenants; payment default on, or accelerations of, other material indebtedness; bankruptcy or insolvency; material judgments entered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain specified events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain changes in control of the Company; and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or other documents associated with the Credit Agreement.
In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, on September 22, 2011, the Company terminated its five-year, $450 million credit facility, which was due to expire in June 2012.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, some of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, or their affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, commercial banking, investment banking, trust, advisory or other financial services for the Company and its affiliates.
This description of the Credit Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The indemnity under this Section 2.17(d) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Recipient delivers to the relevant Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
Indemnification by the Borrowers
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Loan Party (as applicable) in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.

Upon the reasonable request of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall as soon as reasonably practicable after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.17(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been

(b) Each Borrower shall make all payments to be made by it under a Loan Document without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.
(c) Each Borrower shall promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If the Administrative Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify such Borrower.
(d) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by a Borrower under any Loan Document, the amount of the payment due from that Borrower shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.
(e) A Borrower is not required to make an increased payment to a Lender under clause (d) above for a Tax Deduction in respect of tax imposed by the United Kingdom from a payment of interest on a Loan, if on the date on which the payment falls due:
(A) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax Deduction if it was a Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority; or
(B) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely under sub-paragraph (i)(b) of the definition of Qualifying Lender and:
1. an officer of H.M. Revenue & Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction (a "") under section 931 of the ITA which relates to that payment and that Lender has received from the Borrower making the payment a certified copy of that Direction; and
Direction
2. the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction in the absence of that Direction; or
(C) the relevant Lender is a Treaty Lender and the Borrower making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under clause (h) below.

(D) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of sub-paragraph (i)(b) of the definition of Qualifying Lender and:
1. the relevant Lender has not given a Tax Confirmation to the Borrower; and
2. the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if the Lender had given a Tax Confirmation to the Borrower, on the basis that the Tax Confirmation would have enabled the Borrower to have formed a reasonable belief that the payment was an "excepted payment" for the purpose of section 930 of the ITA.
(f) If a Borrower is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Borrower shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.
(g) Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Borrower making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for the Lender entitled to the payment a statement under section 975 of the ITA or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Lender that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.
(h)
(A) A Treaty Lender and each Borrower which makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a Tax Deduction.
(B) Nothing in paragraph (A) above shall require a Treaty Lender to:
a. register under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme;
b. apply the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to any Loan if it has so registered; or
c. file Treaty forms if it has included an indication to the effect that it wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to apply to this Agreement in accordance with clause (i) below and the Borrower making that payment has not complied with its obligations under clause (j) below.
(i) A Treaty Lender which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall provide an indication to that effect by notifying the relevant Borrower of its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence (and, in the case of a Treaty Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement on the Effective Date, it may provide such notification by including such details on its signature page to this Agreement).
(j) Where a Lender includes the indication described in clause (i) above the relevant Borrower shall file a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Lender with HM Revenue & Customs, within 30 days of the date such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement or, within 30 days of the date such Borrower becomes a Borrower under this Agreement (as the case may be), and shall promptly provide the Lender with a copy of that filing.

(k) Each Borrower shall (within 3 Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected Party determines will be or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of UK Tax by that Protected Party in respect of any Loan Document.
(l) Clause (k) above shall not apply with respect to any UK Tax assessed on a Protected Party:
(A) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Protected Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Protected Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or
(B) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Protected Party's facility office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,
if that UK Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Protected Party.
(m) Furthermore, clause (k) above shall not apply to the extent a loss, liability or cost:
(A) is compensated for by an increased payment under clause (d) above; or
(B) would have been compensated for by an increased payment under clause (d) above but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in clause (e) applied.
(n) A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim under clause (k) above shall promptly notify the Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower.
(o) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from a Borrower under clause (k) above, notify the Administrative Agent.
(p) If a Borrower makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Lender determines that:
(A) a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part or to that Tax Payment; and
(B) that Lender has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Credit,
the relevant Lender shall pay an amount to the Borrower which that Lender determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been made by such Borrower.
(q) A UK Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that set out in the Tax Confirmation.
(r) Each Lender shall indicate to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such indication, shall inform the Borrower), which of the following categories it falls in:
(A) not a Qualifying Lender;
 
Table of Contents
(B) a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or
(C) a Treaty Lender.
If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this clause (r) then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Borrower) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Borrower).
(s) Each Borrower shall pay and, within three (3) Business Days of demand, indemnify each Credit Party against any cost, loss or liability that Credit Party incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar UK Taxes payable in respect of any Loan Document (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such UK Tax arising in connection with an assignment or transfer by that Credit Party of its rights under any Loan Document).
(t) All amounts set out, or expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party to a Credit Party which (in whole or part) constitute the consideration for a supply or supplies for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply or supplies, and accordingly, subject to clause (u) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Credit Party to any party under a Loan Document, that party shall pay to the Credit Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Credit Party shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to such party).
(u) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Credit Party (the "") to any other Credit Party (the "") under a Finance Document, and any party other than the Recipient (the "") is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse the Recipient in respect of that consideration), such party shall also pay to the Supplier (in addition to and at the same time as paying such amount) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT. The Recipient will promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines is in respect of such VAT.

(v) Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse a Credit Party for any costs or expenses, that party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Credit Party against all VAT incurred by the Credit Party in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Credit Party reasonably determines that neither it nor any other member of any group of which it is a member for VAT purposes is entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of the VAT.
(w) Any reference in this Section 2.18 to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).
SECTION 2.19. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars by the Company, 12:00 noon, New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in a Foreign Currency or by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, 12:00 noon,
 
Table of Contents
Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to euro, in euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency or to a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the "") no longer exists or any Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Original Currency
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) At the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant to Section 9.03), and other sums payable under the Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by a Borrower (or the Company on behalf of a Borrower) pursuant to Section 2.03 or a deemed request as provided in this Section or may be deducted from any deposit account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to make a Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Sections 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the relevant Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents.

(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or each of the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.19(e) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.20. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or

2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or 2.18 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17 or 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.21. . The Company may from time to time elect to increase the Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an ""), in each case in minimum increments of $25,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $200,000,000. The Company may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an ""), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an ""), to increase their existing Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or extend Commitments, as the case may be; that (i) each Augmenting Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Company and the Administrative Agent and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Company and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Company and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of hereto. No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.21. Increases and new Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company and (B) the

Company shall be in compliance (on a Pro Forma Basis) with the covenants contained in Section 6.07 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the applicable Borrower, or the Company on behalf of the applicable Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans, (b) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans; provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans. Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an "") of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrowers, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21. Nothing contained in this Section 2.21 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time.

SECTION 2.23. . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency,

each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.19, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.
SECTION 2.24. . On the Effective Date, and subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions in Article IV hereto, the Initial Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers shall become Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to any such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. After the Effective Date, the Company may at any time and from time to time designate any Eligible Foreign Subsidiary as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company and the satisfaction of the other conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03, and upon such delivery and satisfaction such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to such Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder, that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to make further Borrowings under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall furnish a copy thereof to each Lender.

SECTION 2.25. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a);
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); , that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;
provided
(c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;

(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the relevant Issuing Banks only the Borrowers' obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Company cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the relevant Issuing Banks until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company and each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any other Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any other Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; (e) the failure of the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Obligations, if any; (f) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of any other Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Obligations; (g) the enforceability or validity of the Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any other Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Obligations, for any reason related to this Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction purporting to prohibit the payment by such other Borrower or any other guarantor of the Obligations, of any of the Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of any of the Obligations; or (h) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in favor of any other Borrower or any other Person.

The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York, Chicago or any other Eurocurrency Payment Office and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in any material respect, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Equivalent Amount in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, Chicago or such other Eurocurrency Payment Office as is designated by the Administrative Agent and, as a separate and independent obligation, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank and any Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.

Berwyn, PA, July 24, 2012  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced second quarter results that established records for orders, operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. In addition, backlog at June 30, 2012 exceeded $1 billion and was an all-time high.
All per share amounts in this press release reflect the impact of a 3-for-2 stock split paid on June 29, 2012.
AMETEK's second quarter 2012 sales of $825.9 million were up 9% over the same period of 2011. Operating income for the second quarter of 2012 was $185.0 million, an 18% increase from the $157.0 million recorded in the same period of 2011. Operating margins improved 170 basis points to 22.4% in the second quarter of 2012. Net income increased 21% to $113.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, from the second quarter 2011 levels of $94.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
"AMETEK performed well in the second quarter in a slowing global economic environment. Our Operational Excellence initiatives, contributions from acquired businesses, and the continued strength of our aerospace and oil and gas businesses allowed us to exceed our second quarter earnings expectations and raise our 2012 earnings guidance. We have and will continue to take appropriate actions to manage our costs while remaining an active acquirer," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
For the second quarter of 2012, EIG sales increased 11% to $452.1 million. Operating income was $117.7 million, compared with $101.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 16% increase. Operating margins for the quarter were 26.0%, up 110 basis points from 24.9% in last year's second quarter.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG performed well in the second quarter. Sales were up due to strength in our aerospace and oil and gas businesses, combined with contributions from the recently acquired O'Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies businesses. Operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 26.0%, benefitting from our Operational Excellence initiatives," said Mr. Hermance.

For the second quarter of 2012, EMG sales increased 6% to $373.8 million. Operating income in the second quarter of 2012 of $78.8 million was up 14%, compared with $69.2 million in the same period of 2011.

Sales, operating income and operating margins were all at record levels in the quarter.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG had a solid second quarter. Sales were up on core growth in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Avicenna Technology, Coining and Dunkermotoren, more than offsetting weakness in our cost-driven motor business. Operating margins were up 140 basis points in the quarter to a record 21.1% driven by our Operational Excellence initiatives," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Our strong portfolio of businesses, record backlog, proven operational capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2012 and beyond. We are increasing our earnings guidance for 2012 even though we expect the slowdown in the global economic environment to continue. We are responding with additional cost containment actions to ensure that we are properly positioned for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. We will remain an active acquirer," noted Mr. Hermance.
2012 Outlook
"We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011 with organic growth of low to mid single digits on a percentage basis. Earnings for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share, up 16% to 17% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, the benefit from recent acquisitions and our operational initiatives. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.83 per diluted share that was given as part of our first quarter earnings release," added Mr. Hermance.
"Third quarter sales are expected to be up low double digits on a percentage basis over last year's third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.46 per diluted share, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's third quarter of $0.40 per diluted share," concluded Mr. Hermance.

AMETEK ANNOUNCES RECORD RESULTS
"EIG performed very well in the third quarter. Sales were up due to strength in our oil and gas, aerospace, and power businesses, combined with contributions from the recently acquired O'Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies businesses.

Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG had a solid third quarter. Sales were up on core growth in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the recent acquisition of Dunkermotoren, more than offsetting continued weakness in our cost-driven motor business. Operating margins were up nicely driven by the higher revenue and our Operational Excellence initiatives," commented Mr. Hermance.
"Despite the sluggish global environment, AMETEK performed well due to our strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions. We are increasing our earnings guidance for 2012 given our third quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will respond with additional cost containment actions should business conditions warrant, and we will remain an active acquirer," noted Mr. Hermance.
2012 Outlook
"We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011 reflecting low to mid single digit organic growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions including Micro-Poise Measurement Systems, which we announced today. Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.87 per diluted share, up 17% to 18% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, the benefit from recent acquisitions and our operational initiatives. This EPS guidance is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share that was provided as part of our second quarter earnings release," added Mr. Hermance.
"Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up mid teens on a percentage basis over last year's fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.46 to $0.48 per diluted share, an increase of 10% to 14% over last year's fourth quarter of $0.42 per diluted share," concluded Mr. Hermance.

AMETEK's fourth quarter 2012 sales of $841.8 million were up 10% over the same period of 2011. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $190.0 million, a 13% increase from $167.4 million recorded in the same period of 2011. Operating margins improved 70 basis points to a record 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.49 per diluted share from the fourth quarter 2011 level of $0.42 per diluted share.
"AMETEK had a solid fourth quarter to complete a very strong 2012. We established records for essentially all key financial metrics in the quarter despite continued sluggish market conditions. Operating margins expanded 70 basis points to a record 22.6%, resulting from our focus on Operational Excellence initiatives. Orders were very strong in the quarter, totaling $956 million, up 28% from last year's fourth quarter with 4% core growth," notes Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Cash flow was superb, with both the fourth quarter and the full-year results representing records. Operating cash flow was $192 million for the quarter and $611 million for the year, up 25% and 20%, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2011," continued Mr. Hermance.
For the full year, AMETEK achieved record levels of orders, sales, operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. Full year sales were $3.33 billion, up 12% from 2011. Operating income in 2012 was $745.9 million, compared with $635.9 million last year, up 17%.

"EIG had a very solid fourth quarter. Sales grew 12% in the quarter on continued strength in our oil and gas, and aerospace businesses, combined with the contributions from the acquisitions of O'Brien and Micro-Poise. Operating margins benefitted from our Operational Excellence initiatives," notes Mr. Hermance.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, EMG sales increased 8% to $347.2 million. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $65.2 million was up 5%, compared with $62.3 million in the same period of 2011. Operating margins for the quarter were 18.8%, compared with 19.4% in last year's fourth quarter.
Electromechanical Group (EMG)
"EMG had a good quarter. Sales increased 8% on core growth in our Precision Motion Control business and the contribution from the acquisition of Dunkermotoren. We experienced softness in several end markets as customers turned increasingly cautious due to macro-economic uncertainties," adds Mr. Hermance.
"We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth in 2013, with organic growth stronger in the second half of the year. Our higher margin, longer cycle, oil and gas, power, and aerospace businesses should show particular strength. AMETEK's strong portfolio of differentiated businesses, proven operational capabilities, continued investment in new product development and geographic expansion, and a continued focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2013," notes Mr. Hermance.
2013 Outlook
"We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up in the high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012, reflecting low to mid single digit core growth and contributions from recent acquisitions including Dunkermotoren and Micro-Poise. Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over 2012, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, operational excellence initiatives, and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions," adds Mr. Hermance.
"First quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.49 to $0.51 per diluted share, an increase of 9% to 13% over last year's first quarter of $0.45 per diluted share," concludes Mr. Hermance.

Berwyn, PA, April 25, 2013  AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced first quarter results that established records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share.
AMETEK's first quarter 2013 sales of $882.9 million were up 7% over the same period of 2012. Operating income was $197.2 million in the first quarter of 2013, an 8% increase from $182.8 million recorded in the same period of 2012. Net income in the first quarter of 2013 increased 14% to $125.1 million, from $110.2 million in last year's first quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.51 per diluted share, from the first quarter 2012 level of $0.45 per diluted share.
The first quarter 2013 results include approximately $0.01 per diluted share in realignment costs and approximately $0.01 per diluted share in costs related to the performance-based accelerated vesting of restricted stock. Performance-based vesting occurred as a result of the stock price doubling in less than three years since the issue of the grant, reflecting the significant value created for AMETEK shareholders.
"AMETEK achieved solid results in the first quarter with sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share at record levels. While end market demand remains tepid, our team executed extremely well on Operational Excellence initiatives, which led to strong results in the quarter," noted Frank S. Hermance, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Cash flow was strong, with operating cash flow totaling $157 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the same period in 2012," continued Mr. Hermance.
For the 2013 first quarter, EIG sales increased 3% to $484.5 million. Operating income in the quarter increased 7% to $131.7 million, compared with $123.0 million in the first quarter of 2012. Operating margins were 27.2% in the first quarter, up 100 basis points from 26.2% in last year's first quarter.
Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)
"EIG had a solid first quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were up due to strength in our Aerospace and oil and gas businesses, combined with the contribution from the Micro-Poise acquisition. Operating margins expanded nicely driven by the higher revenue and our Operational Excellence initiatives," said Mr. Hermance.

"EMG also had a solid first quarter with strong core growth in our third party Aerospace MRO business and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition driving the top line increase," commented Mr. Hermance.
"We expect sluggish end market conditions to continue. We have taken additional cost actions to ensure we are properly positioned for the remainder of 2013. Organic growth in the second half of the year is expected to be stronger than the first half. Our strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2013," noted Mr. Hermance.
2013 Outlook
"We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012, reflecting low to mid-single digit core growth and contributions from recent acquisitions. Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 11% to 13% over 2012, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, operational initiatives and the contributions from recently acquired businesses," added Mr. Hermance.
"Second quarter sales are expected to be up mid to high single digits over last year's second quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.51 to $0.52 per diluted share, an increase of 9% to 11% over last year's second quarter of $0.47 per diluted share," concluded Mr. Hermance.
