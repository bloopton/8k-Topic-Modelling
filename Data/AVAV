Exhibit 99.1
MONROVIA, CA, March 8, 2007  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for the fiscal 2007 third quarter and nine-month period ended January 27, 2007. Results for both periods showed significant growth in revenue and income from operations. Highlights of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to the same quarter a year ago were as follows:
"Our third quarter results reflect successful execution of our plans, with growth in our UAS and PosiCharge fast charge systems segments compared to the same period in fiscal 2006," said Tim Conver, chief executive officer and president of AV. "This growth indicates the increasing adoption of our solutions by our customers to help improve their productivity, safety and efficiency. Our new partnership with our shareholders will help us to pursue the opportunities that we believe will contribute to continued growth."
FISCAL 2007 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $46.3 million, an increase of 30% over third quarter fiscal 2006 revenue of $35.5 million. The increase in revenue was caused by higher sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $10.1 million (or 35%) and in our PosiCharge segment of $0.9 million (or 22%), partially offset by lower revenue from our Energy Technology Center segment of $0.3 million (or 12%).
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $13.2 million, up 111% from third quarter fiscal 2006 income from operations of $6.2 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $4.1 million, lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $1.6 million, and lower research and development expense of $1.3 million. The decrease in SG&A expense reflected the reversal of our supplemental executive retirement plan, which improved profitability by $2.2 million.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $8.9 million, an increase of 102% over third quarter fiscal 2006 net income of $4.4 million.
YEAR TO DATE RESULTS
Revenue for the nine-month period ended January 27, 2007 was $123.0 million, an increase of 13% over our revenue of $108.8 million for the nine-month period ended January 28, 2006. The increase in revenue was caused by higher sales in our UAS segment of $15.1 million (or 17%) and in our Energy Technology Center segment of $0.4 million (or 6%), partially offset by lower sales in our PosiCharge segment of $1.2 million (or 8%).
Income from operations for the nine-month period ended January 27, 2007 was $23.0 million, up 38% from our income from operations of $16.7 million for the nine-month period ended January 28, 2006. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $5.0 million and lower R&D expense of $1.3 million.
Net income for the nine-month period ended January 27, 2007 was $15.1 million, an increase of 29%, over our net income of $11.7 million for the nine-month period ended January 28, 2006.
Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $92.8 million to $108.2 million at January 27, 2007 from $15.4 million at April 30, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of $80.5 million from our initial public offering of our common stock in January 2007.
 
BACKLOG
As of January 27, 2007, we reported funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) of $43.2 million, compared to $79.7 million as of April 30, 2006, and $48.2 million as of January 28, 2006.
FISCAL 2007  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
AV currently expects to achieve total fiscal year 2007 revenue growth of between 20% and 25% from fiscal year 2006 levels, with an operating income margin between 15% and 16%. The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

MONROVIA, CA, June 26, 2007  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 2007.  Results for both periods showed significant growth in revenue and income from operations.  Highlights of the fourth quarter and full fiscal year include:
Strong performance from our UAS business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year resulted in full year revenue of $174 million, up 25% from the prior year and at the high end of our guidance range of 20 to 25% revenue growth.  Operating margin of 18% for the full year exceeded our annual operating profit margin guidance range of 15 to 16%, said Tim Conver, chief executive officer and president of AV.  This growth indicates the increasing adoption of our solutions by our customers to help improve their productivity, safety and efficiency, as well as the continued, successful execution of our plans by our team, he added.
FISCAL 2007 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $50.7 million, an increase of 66% over fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue of $30.6 million. The increase in revenue was a result of increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $20.3 million and in our Energy Technology Center segment of $0.9 million, partially offset by lower revenue from our PosiCharge Systems segment of $1.1 million.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $7.5 million, up $8.4 million from fourth quarter fiscal 2006 loss from operations of $0.9 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $6.7 million, lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.8 million, and lower research and development (R&D) expense of $0.8 million.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $5.6 million, an increase of $6.1 million over a fourth quarter fiscal 2006 net loss of $0.5 million.  Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.27 per diluted share, an increase of $0.31 per diluted share over fourth quarter fiscal 2006 loss of $0.04 per share.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
Revenue for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2007 was $173.7 million, an increase of 25% over revenue of $139.4 million for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2006. The increase in revenue was caused by higher sales in our UAS segment of $35.4 million and in our Energy Technology Center segment of $1.3 million, but was partially offset by lower sales in our PosiCharge segment of $2.4 million. The decline in PosiCharge revenue resulted from continued weakness in our U.S. automotive market sales, although we experienced a substantial increase in revenue and new customers in non-auto segments.
Income from operations for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2007 was $30.5 million, up 92% from income from operations of $15.9 million for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2006. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $11.7 million, lower SG&A expense of $0.8 million, and lower R&D expense of $2.2 million.
Net income for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2007 was $20.7 million, an increase of 85%, over net income of $11.2 million for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2006.
Earnings per share for the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2007 was $1.22 per diluted share, an increase of $0.47 per diluted share over fiscal 2006 earnings of $0.75 per diluted share.
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased by $93.8 million to $109.2 million at April 30, 2007 from $15.4 million at April 30, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of $80.5 million from the initial public offering of our common stock in January 2007 and cash from operations for the year of $15.0 million.
BACKLOG
As of April 30, 2007, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $60.9 million compared to $79.7 million as of April 30, 2006.
FISCAL 2008  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
For fiscal year 2008 the Company expects to achieve revenue growth of between 20% and 25% over fiscal year 2007, with an operating income margin of between 12% and 14%.  The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect managements view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.  The Company's three to five year compound annual growth target for revenue is between 20% and 25%, with 12% to 14% operating income margin.

           President and Chief Executive Officer
 
 

The Board of Directors of AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV), a leader in unmanned aircraft systems and efficient electric energy systems, today announced that it has unanimously elected Tim Conver as its new chairman of the board.  After joining AVs Board of Directors in the late 1980s Conver became its president in 1991 and assumed the additional role of chief executive officer shortly thereafter.  Conver now assumes the role previously held by Dr. Paul MacCready, who has retired as chairman and director as a result of a recently diagnosed, serious health issue.   Mr. Convers appointment is effective immediately.
MONROVIA, Calif., Aug. 20, 2007 --
Dr. MacCready, the Companys founder, has served as chairman of its board of directors for the past 16 years.  Dr. MacCready transferred responsibility for the Companys management and operations in the 1990s, which allowed him to focus on addressing critical global issues such as transportation, energy efficiency, resources and population.  In recent years Dr. MacCready helped to mentor a new generation of engineers at AV, providing his insights into challenging technical issues and alternative approaches to problem solving.
As our founder, Pauls approaches to problem solving and innovation became key components of our culture and continue to have an immeasurable impact in shaping the AV of today and tomorrow.  As chairman, he has provided valuable guidance and inspiration to our employees and his fellow Board members, as well as to many other people around the globe, said Tim Conver.  Pauls full schedule outside of the Company during the past 15 years has kept him busy applying his wise counsel, guidance and systems solutions to global problems at the nexus of energy, the environment and population.  His presence at the Company will be sorely missed by the entire AV family, but his contributions will continue to benefit us and society for some time.  We send Paul and his family our heartfelt gratitude along with our best wishes.
Dr. Paul MacCready
Born in 1925, Dr. MacCready founded AeroVironment in 1971 and this month is celebrating the 30 anniversary of the record-setting flight of the Gossamer Condor, which made the worlds first sustained, controlled flight powered solely by a human on August 23, 1977.  The feat led to Dr. MacCready being nicknamed the father of human-powered flight.  Dr. MacCready was named Engineer of the Century by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and selected Graduate of the Decade by the California Institute of Technology.  He was named one of the 100 greatest minds of the 20 century by Time Magazine.  He told Time in December 2000, I try to avoid administrative tasks as much as I can and instead think about the big picture and what the world needs.

We experienced continued, strong sales of our small UAS, particularly Raven, which has now been adopted by the U.S. Army, Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Air Force.  The U.S. Air Force also took delivery of its initial BATMAV micro unmanned aircraft systems from us, which include the WASP III air vehicle. Our contract logistics support for these systems also increased in the quarter.  Combined with solid performance from our PosiCharge and Energy Technology segments, these results reflect effective execution across the business, and indicate a growing demand for our solutions.
FISCAL 2008 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $49.2 million, an increase of 56% over first quarter fiscal 2007 revenue of $31.6 million. The increase in revenue was a result of increased sales in AVs UAS segment of $16.9 million or 68%, its PosiCharge segment of $0.4 million or 8%, and in its Energy Technology Center segment of $0.3 million or 21%.
Gross margin for the quarter was $16.8 million, or 34% of revenue, compared to $12.0 million, or 38% of revenue, in the same quarter last year.  The lower margin largely reflects lower fixed price revenue relative to cost reimbursable revenue compared to the same period in the prior year.
Income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $4.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 139%, over first quarter fiscal 2007 income from operations of $2.0 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $4.8 million partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense of $1.6 million and higher research and development expense of $0.5 million.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $3.8 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 182%, over first quarter fiscal 2007 net income of $1.4 million.  Earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 per diluted share over first quarter of fiscal 2007 earnings per share of $0.09 per diluted share.
BACKLOG
As of July 28, 2007, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to AV under a customer contract) was $61.7 million compared to $60.9 million as of April 30, 2007.
FISCAL 2008  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
For fiscal year 2008 AV maintains its guidance of revenue growth of between 20% and 25% over fiscal year 2007, with an operating income margin of between 12% and 14%.  The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect managements view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

On November 19, 2007, AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) was awarded a $19.3 million order by the U.S. Marine Corps for Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) systems, spares and support services.  Each BATMAV system consists of two Wasp III micro air vehicles, a ground control system, and operators kit.
The Marine Corps will procure the BATMAV systems through a five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract awarded to AV by the U.S. Air Force in December 2006 to acquire and field BATMAV systems to meet the small units need for real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition and battle damage assessment.  The contract provides for purchases of up to $45 million over the term of the contract, including procurement of micro air vehicle integration efforts, AVs Wasp III micro air vehicle, ground control systems, initial spares, training and sustainment under the Air Force Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) program of record.
The development and integration phase of the contract was completed under a cost-plus fixed-fee arrangement in October 2007.  In November 2007, the Marine Corps signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Air Force to procure systems under the BATMAV contract.  The Marine Corps order brings the total current funded value of the BATMAV contract to $22.6 million.
 
 
On November 20, 2007, AV issued a press release announcing the Marine Corps order.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

 AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV), a leader in unmanned aircraft systems and efficient electric energy systems, today announced that the U.S. Marine Corps has ordered $19.3 million in BATMAV (Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle) systems, each consisting of two Wasp III micro air vehicles, AVs Advanced Battery Charger, spares and support services.  The order followed a successful Marine Corps evaluation of Wasp systems provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
MONROVIA, Calif., Nov. 20, 2007
The Marine Corps will procure the BATMAV systems through the Air Force BATMAV contract, which was awarded to AV in December 2006 and provides a means for other U.S. armed services to procure these systems.  The Marine Corps plans to issue Wasp III systems to the battalion for deployment at the platoon level, representing a basis of issue that is lower in the force structure than that of AVs Raven small unmanned aircraft system.
The small size and light weight of Wasp make it ideally suited for deployment directly to platoons, where flexibility, portability and reliability are critically important.  We have been evaluating Wasp for some time, and believe that it offers a unique new capability to support our Marines missions around the world, said U.S. Marine Corps Major James Roudebush, Tier I UAV Program Manager, PMA-263.  These Wasp systems, like the Ravens and Dragon Eyes, help our teams operate more successfully and ultimately help protect their lives.
The planned deployment of Wasp to the platoon level reflects its value to the warfighter, said John Grabowsky, executive vice president and general manager, AV Unmanned Aircraft
Systems.  Just as our Raven has become the small UAS solution in support of programs for the Army, Marines, Special Operations and Air Force, we believe Wasp III to be the emerging micro UAS solution.
The U.S. Air Force selected Wasp III as the micro UAS for its BATMAV program. With a wingspan of 29 inches and weighing only one pound, the Wasp III carries one infrared and two color cameras that transmit streaming video directly to the hand-held ground controller for display on an integrated monitor. Wasp III is the first micro air vehicle to be adopted by the U.S. armed forces in support of a program of record. Its portability and reliability are being demonstrated through continuing evaluation in forward locations.

MONROVIA, CA, December 4, 2007  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV), a leader in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and efficient electric energy systems, today reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended October 27, 2007.  
Growth in our UAS and PosiCharge segments reflects ongoing customer confidence in the value delivered by our solutions and the effective execution of our plans, said Tim Conver, chairman, chief executive officer and president of AV. Our team continues to deliver positive results both in core businesses and in new product development. Raven and Wasp are our key small UAS supporting programs of record. The number of these systems deployed around the world continues to increase as they regularly provide cost-effective force protection where they are employed. The receipt of a $57 million base development contract for the Global Observer stratospheric persistent platform, with options for additional aircraft totaling $51 million, represented a major achievement during the quarter that shows market endorsement of another AV innovation and positions us for further growth.
FISCAL 2008 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $53.7 million, an increase of 19%, over revenue of $45.2 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2007. The increase in revenue was the result of increased sales in AVs UAS segment of $8.7 million, or 23%, and in its PosiCharge Systems segment of $0.7 million, or 16%, which was partially offset by a decrease in its Energy Technology Center segment of $0.9 million, or 34%.
Gross margin for the quarter was $18.9 million, or 35% of revenue, compared to $17.8 million, or 39% of revenue, in the same quarter last year.  The higher gross margin reflects the growth in revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin rates.
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 17%, from second quarter fiscal 2007 income from operations of $7.9 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $1.8 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.6 million, partially offset by increased gross margin of $1.1 million.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $5.2 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 6%, over second quarter fiscal 2007 net income of $4.9 million.  Earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $0.24 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.07 per diluted share over second quarter of fiscal 2007 earnings per share of $0.31 per diluted share.
FISCAL 2008 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $102.9 million, an increase of 34%, over revenue of $76.7 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2007. The increase in revenue was the result of increased sales in AVs UAS segment of $25.6 million, or 41%, and in its PosiCharge Systems segment of $1.1 million, or 12%, which was partially offset by lower sales in its Energy Technology Center segment of $0.6 million, or 13%.
Gross margin for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $35.8 million, or 35% of revenue, compared to $29.8 million, or 39% of revenue, for the same six months last year.  The higher gross margin reflects the growth in revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin rates.
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $11.4 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 15%, over the same six months of fiscal 2007 income from operations of $9.9 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $6.0 million, which was partially offset by higher SG&A expense of $3.4 million and higher R&D expense of $1.1 million.
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $9.0 million, an increase of $2.7 million, or 44%, over the same six months of fiscal 2007 net income of $6.3 million.  Earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2008 was $0.42 per diluted share, an increase of $0.02 per diluted share over the first six months of fiscal 2007 earnings per share of $0.40 per diluted share.

MONROVIA, CA, March 3, 2008  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV), a leader in unmanned aircraft systems and efficient electric energy systems, today reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended January 26, 2008.  
"Our unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) segment continues to generate growth as a result of ongoing demand for our small UAS production systems and for the new capabilities we are pioneering in our development programs, said Tim Conver, chief executive officer of AV. Raven and Wasp systems are helping to protect the lives of our troops while providing cost-effective force multiplication that enables them to operate more successfully. The increasing contribution of our UAS service business reflects the broader procurement, deployment and use of our systems throughout the U.S. armed forces. I believe that all of our solutions provide meaningful benefits to current and potential customers in the U.S. and abroad, and that we remain well-positioned for continued growth.
Third quarter highlights:
FISCAL 2008 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $48.5 million, an increase of 5%, over revenue of $46.3 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2007. The increase in revenue was the result of increased sales in AVs UAS segment of $3.4 million, or 9%, and in its Energy Technology Center segment of $0.2 million, or 9%, which was partially offset by a decrease in its PosiCharge segment of $1.3 million, or 24%.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $8.0 million, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 40%, from third quarter of fiscal 2007 income from operations of $13.2 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher selling, general and administrative expense of $4.0 million and higher research and development expense of $1.4 million, partially offset by increased gross margin of $0.2 million.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 33%, from third quarter of fiscal 2007 net income of $8.9 million.  Earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.28, a decrease of $0.29 per diluted share from third quarter of fiscal 2007 earnings per diluted share of $0.57.
FISCAL 2008 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $151.4 million, an increase of 23% over revenue of $123.0 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2007. The increase in revenue was the result of increased sales in AVs UAS segment of $29.0 million, or 29%, which was partially offset by lower sales in its PosiCharge Systems segment of $0.2 million, or 1%, and in its Energy Technology Center segment of $0.4 million, or 6%.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $19.3 million, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 16%, from the same nine months of fiscal 2007 income from operations of $23.0 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher selling, general and administrative expense of $7.4 million and higher research and development expense of $2.5 million, partially offset by increased gross margin of $6.2 million.
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, from the same nine months of fiscal 2007 net income of $15.1 million.  Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 were $0.70, a decrease of $0.28 per diluted share from the first nine months of fiscal 2007 earnings per diluted share of $0.98.

Effective May 1, 2008, Patrick R. Dellario resigned from his position as Vice President and General Manager, PosiCharge Systems, of AeroVironment, Inc. (AeroVironment) in connection with the reorganization described in Item 8.01 below.  Mr. Dellario remains an employee of AeroVironment.
 
 
Also effective May 1, 2008, AeroVironment consolidated the operations of its PosiCharge Systems and Energy Technology Center businesses to form the newly named Efficient Energy Systems.  Michael Bissonette, who previously served as Vice President and General Manager of AeroVironments Energy Technology Center, has been appointed Vice President and General Manager of the consolidated group.
 
The change in organizational structure parallels AeroVironments previous consolidation of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) production and its UAS research, development and commercialization group approximately two years ago.  As is the case with its UAS business, AeroVironment will continue to pursue production and research, development and commercialization activities within Efficient Energy Systems.  By reorganizing, AeroVironment intends to take advantage of operational synergies and optimize management time by focusing on two as opposed to three business segments. As a result of the reorganization, beginning with its initial quarterly report for fiscal year 2009, AeroVironment's operations will be divided into two reportable segments, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, .

Press Release
MONROVIA, CA, June 24, 2008  (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 2008.
AeroVironment, Inc.
We completed our second fiscal year-end as a public company and once again achieved our financial objectives, generating revenue growth of 24% and an operating margin of 13%.  This places us within both our fiscal 2008 revenue guidance range of 20% to 25%, and our operating margin guidance range of 12% to 14%, said Tim Conver, chairman and chief executive officer of AV.  Strength in the demand for our unmanned aircraft systems and their support drove growth over last year as our systems became increasingly embedded into the way our customers operate.  Our record fourth quarter performance was an indicator of the demand for our solutions and the ability of our team to execute successfully.
FISCAL 2008 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $64.3 million, an increase of 27% over fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue of $50.7 million. The increase in revenue was a result of increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $11.1 million, PosiCharge Systems segment of $1.2 million and in our Energy Technology Center segment of $1.3 million.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $9.1 million, up $1.6 million from fourth quarter fiscal 2007 income from operations of $7.5 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $3.8 million partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.2 million.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $6.4 million, an increase of $0.8 million over fourth quarter fiscal 2007 net income of $5.6 million.  Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $0.30 per diluted share, an increase of $0.03 per diluted share over fourth quarter fiscal 2007 earnings of $0.27 per diluted share.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
Revenue for fiscal 2008 was $215.7 million, an increase of 24% over revenue of $173.7 million for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenue was caused by higher sales in our UAS segment of $40.1 million, PosiCharge Systems segment of $1.0 million, and Energy Technology Center segment of $0.9 million.
Income from operations for fiscal 2008 was $28.4 million, down 7% from income from operations of $30.5 million for fiscal 2007. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher SG&A expense of $9.6 million and higher R&D expense of $2.5 million partially offset by increased gross margin of $10.0 million.
Net income for fiscal 2008 was $21.4 million, an increase of 3%, over net income of $20.7 million for fiscal 2007.  Earnings per share for fiscal 2008 was $1.00 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.22 per diluted share over fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.22 per diluted share.
BACKLOG
As of April 30, 2008, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $82.0 million compared to $60.9 million as of April 30, 2007.
FISCAL 2009  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
For fiscal year 2009 the Company expects to achieve revenue growth of between 20% and 25% over fiscal year 2008, with an operating income margin of between 12% and 14%. The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect managements view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

 selected Puma AE as its
The hand-launched Puma AE lands near-vertically on both land and water and is equipped with a day- and night-capable, waterproof sensor package that provides image tracking, image stabilization and high-image quality.  Puma AE systems incorporate the same hand-held Ground Control Unit used by U.S. Department of Defense and allied military customers to control Raven and Wasp systems.  Ship-based use of Puma AE requires no modification to naval vessels, enabling easy integration into maritime operations.  The AECV program represents the fourth U.S. Department of Defense full and open competition for a small UAS program of record, and the fourth such competition won by AV.
AV responded to a USSOCOM requirement for a hand-launched UAS.  We are pleased to be chosen to deliver these capabilities into the hands of warfighters with a new, more capable third generation version of our Puma, said John Grabowsky, AV executive vice president and general manager of unmanned aircraft systems.  Puma AE joins Raven and Wasp in AVs product
portfolio, delivering a powerful new solution for land and ship-based, over-the-horizon intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, Grabowsky added.
U.S. armed forces including the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and USSOCOM, as well as international forces such as those of Italy, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands, use AVs hand-launched UAS for missions that include base security, route reconnaissance, mission planning, battle damage assessment and force protection.  The U.S. Army has reported that Army Raven UAS were flown for approximately 150,000 combat hours in 2007.  AV has delivered more than 10,000 small unmanned aircraft to date, including Raven, Wasp and Puma.

PRESS RELEASE
 
AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 First Quarter Results
 
MONROVIA, CA, September 9, 2008  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended August 2, 2008.
 
"Continued progress in our Global Observer development program contributed to an increase in first quarter revenue over the same period last year.  We generated this increase despite a reduction in UAS product revenue that resulted from the planned implementation of a radio frequency change to our small UAS during the quarter," said Tim Conver, chairman and chief executive officer of AV.  "Indicative of what we view as a growing market for small UAS, winning the All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) competition with our Puma AE earned us the fourth Department of Defense program of record for small UAS.  This new aircraft expands AV's product offering and provides valuable new capabilities, reflecting our continued focus on developing innovative solutions that help our customers win."
 
First quarter highlights:
 
                 
Revenue of $53.6 million
 
                 
Operating margin of 13%
 
                 
Earnings per diluted share of $0.22
 
FISCAL 2009 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $53.6 million, up 9% over first quarter fiscal 2008 revenue of $49.2 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $4.2 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) of $0.2 million.
 
Income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $7.2 million, up 50% from first quarter fiscal 2008 income from operations of $4.8 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $3.7 million, partially offset by higher research and development expense of $1.0 million and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.3 million.
 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $4.8 million, up 25% from first quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $3.8 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.22, up 22% over first quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.18.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of August 2, 2008, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $108.9 million compared to $82.0 million as of April 30, 2008.
 
FISCAL 2009  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2009 the company maintains its guidance of revenue growth of between 20% and 25% over fiscal year 2008, with an operating income margin of between 12% and 14%.  The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

PRESS RELEASE
MONROVIA, CA, September 29, 2008  AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today announced that its chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Timothy E. Conver, as Trustee of The Conver Family Trust, has established a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a portion of company stock held by the Trust over a specific period of time.  The stock trading plan is part of a long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity and was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and AeroVironments policies with respect to employee stock transactions.
(
AeroVironment, Inc.
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can diversify their investment portfolios, can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about whether they had material, non-public information when they sold their stock.
Under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, the Trust may sell up to 280,000 shares over a period of approximately nine months. If the Trust completes all the planned sales under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Conver would beneficially own approximately 4,449,379 shares of AeroVironment common stock (including all options currently exercisable by Mr. Conver), or approximately 21% of the companys current outstanding shares. The transactions under this plan will commence no earlier than November 2008 and will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Form 4 filings will also be posted on AeroVironments website.

AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 Second Quarter Results
 
MONROVIA, CA, December 3, 2008  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended November 1, 2008.
 
"Our second quarter results reflect strong, effective performance and continued diversity within our unmanned aircraft systems portfolio.  The underlying demand for our unique unmanned aircraft system solutions is driving procurement, service and research and development revenue," said Tim Conver, chairman and chief executive officer of AV.  "Both our UAS and EES segments performed well, resulting in record quarterly revenue and a healthy operating margin.  EES, in particular, benefited from product mix and operating efficiencies to deliver a strong gross margin.  Supported by a considerable cash reserve and no debt, our team executed well against our business strategy while robust customer demand and our product development pipeline position us very well for continued growth."
 
Second quarter highlights:
 
Revenue of $65.8 million
                 
 
Operating margin of 19%
                 
 
Earnings per diluted share of $0.41
                 
 
FISCAL 2009 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $65.8 million, up 22% over second quarter fiscal 2008 revenue of $53.7 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $9.9 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.2 million.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $12.2 million, up 87% from second quarter fiscal 2008 income from operations of $6.6 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $6.0 million and lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by higher research and development (R&D) expense of $1.1 million.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $9.1 million, up 75% from second quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $5.2 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.41, up 71% over second quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.24.
 
FISCAL 2009 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was $119.4 million, up 16% over the first six months of fiscal 2008 revenue of $102.9 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $14.1 million and EES segment of $2.4 million.
 
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was $19.5 million, up 71% from the first six months of fiscal 2008 income from operations of $11.4 million. The growth in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $9.8 million and lower SG&A expense of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher R&D expense of $2.1million.
 
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was $13.9 million, up 54% from the first six months of fiscal 2008 net income of $9.0 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was $0.64, up 50% over the first six months of fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.42.

As of November 1, 2008, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $86.6 million compared to $82.0 million as of April 30, 2008.
 
FISCAL 2009  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2009 the company maintains its guidance of revenue growth of between 20% and 25% over fiscal year 2008, with an operating income margin of between 12% and 14%.  The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 Third Quarter Results
 
MONROVIA, CA, March 9, 2009  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended January 31, 2009.
 
"In our fiscal third quarter we continued to supply our innovative solutions to existing and new customers while achieving great progress on our development programs.  The strong order flow generated in the quarter produced record funded backlog, indicating continued demand for our solutions," said Tim Conver, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Even with our backlog, our view of the balance of the year requires that we lower our revenue outlook for fiscal 2009.  This is driven largely by current economic conditions as well as the timing of the receipt and shipment of customer orders, and does not reflect a fundamental change in our long-term view of the demand for our solutions, the relevance of our development programs or the soundness of our business model."
 
Third quarter highlights:
 
Revenue of $52.2 million
                 
 
Operating margin of 8%
                 
 
Earnings per diluted share of $0.21
                 
 
Funded backlog of $139 million
                 
 
FISCAL 2009 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $52.2 million, up 8% over third quarter fiscal 2008 revenue of $48.5 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $1.2 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.5 million.
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $4.1 million, down 48% from third quarter fiscal 2008 income from operations of $8.0 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by lower gross margin of $3.2 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $1.0 million, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.3 million.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $4.5 million, down 24% from third quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $6.0 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.21, down 26% from third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.28.
 
FISCAL 2009 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $171.6 million, up 13% over the first nine months of fiscal 2008 revenue of $151.4 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $15.3 million and EES segment of $4.9 million.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $23.6 million, up 22% from the first nine months of fiscal 2008 income from operations of $19.3 million. The increase in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $6.7 million and lower SG&A expense of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher R&D expense of $3.0 million.
 
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $18.4 million, up 23% from the first nine months of fiscal 2008 net income of $15.0 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $0.84, up 19% from the first nine months of fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.70.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of January 31, 2009, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $139.0 million compared to $82.0 million as of April 30, 2008.  Funded backlog as of January 31, 2009 includes a $39.0 million order for Raven systems that was executed on January 30, 2009 with a stated effective date of February 1, 2009.
 
FISCAL 2009  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2009, the Company is revising its guidance to reflect anticipated full year revenue growth of between 11% and 16% over fiscal year 2008.  The Company maintains its previous guidance with respect to operating margin of between 12% and 14%.
 
"Full year guidance is now lower than the 20% to 25% annual revenue growth guidance for the year that we reiterated last quarter," said Tim Conver.  "Given the current economic environment, the fact that we have record backlog and continue to generate cash, with $131 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments on our balance sheet, serves us well.  In building for the future we made great progress on key development programs including Digital Data Link, Global Observer and Switchblade.  Our team is performing well, our solutions are making an important difference to our customers, and we remain well-positioned for future growth."
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End Results
 
MONROVIA, CA, June 23, 2009  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending April 30, 2009.
 
"We completed fiscal 2009 with record quarterly revenue, achieving 15% year over year revenue growth, 13% operating margin, and record cash and investments. This performance reflects strength in our customers' continued demand for our market-leading solutions and our team's sustained execution," said Tim Conver, chairman and chief executive officer of AV. "Our development programs, Global Observer, Switchblade, Digital Data Link, and electric vehicle solutions, all moved forward in meaningful ways, positioning us well for delivering more, important solutions to our customers and for long term growth. We, like others, were affected by the global economic downturn. However, the U.S. government's recent commitments to increase the emphasis on soldier systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance within the Department of Defense, and electric vehicle infrastructure throughout the country, are positive indications of growing opportunities for the innovative solutions we now provide and are developing in both our segments."
 
 
FISCAL 2009 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $76.0 million, up 18% over fourth quarter fiscal 2008 revenue of $64.3 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $9.4 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.3 million.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $9.0 million, down 2% from fourth quarter fiscal 2008 income from operations of $9.1 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher research and development (R&D) expense of $2.3 million and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $1.2 million, partially offset by higher gross margin of $3.4 million.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $5.8 million, down 9% from fourth quarter fiscal 2008 net income of $6.4 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.27, down from fourth quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.30.
 
FISCAL 2009 FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
Revenue for the fiscal year 2009 was $247.7 million, up 15% over the fiscal year 2008 revenue of $215.7 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $24.8 million and EES segment of $7.2 million.
 
Income from operations for the fiscal year 2009 was $32.6 million, up 14% from the fiscal year 2008 income from operations of $28.4 million. The increase in income from operations was caused by increased gross margin of $10.1 million, partially offset by higher R&D expense of $5.3 million and by higher SG&A expense of $0.6 million.
 
Net income for fiscal year 2009 was $24.2 million, up 13% from fiscal year 2008 net income of $21.4 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2009 was $1.11, up 11% from fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $1.00.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of April 30, 2009, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $114.8 million compared to $82.0 million as of April 30, 2008.
 
FISCAL 2010  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2010, the Company expects revenue growth of 18% to 22% over fiscal year 2009 and operating income margin of 12% to 14%. The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
MONROVIA, CA, September 8, 2009  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended August 1, 2009.
 
"Our fiscal 2010 is developing in a manner that is consistent with our plans, reinforcing our view of 18% to 22% revenue growth for the year with 12% to 14% operating income margin. First quarter results reflect the anticipated deferral of Raven UAS deliveries as customers await the second half availability of new digital Raven systems and upgrade kits for the thousands of aircraft in the field. Low first quarter revenue, combined with maintaining our R&D and other spending to support our full year plan, resulted in a first quarter loss, but this was generally consistent with our FY 2010 plan" said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer. "We expect the availability of digital Raven systems to drive increased revenue in the second half of the year as our Raven customers seek to catch up on their deferred deliveries.  In addition to moving digital Raven systems toward production, we made great progress during the quarter on other development programs to position us for continued long term growth."
 
FISCAL 2010 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $37.9 million, down 29% over first quarter fiscal 2009 revenue of $53.6 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from decreased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $12.8 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.9 million.
 
Loss from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $5.5 million, compared to first quarter fiscal 2009 income from operations of $7.2 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by lower gross margin of $9.9 million, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.4 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.4 million.
 
Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $3.6 million, compared to first quarter fiscal 2009 net income of $4.8 million.
 
Loss per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $0.17, compared to first quarter fiscal 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.22.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of August 1, 2009, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $108.7 million compared to $114.8 million as of April 30, 2009.

PRESS RELEASE
 
MONROVIA, CA, October 7, 2009  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today announced that its chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Timothy E. Conver, as Trustee of The Conver Family Trust, has established a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a portion of company stock held by the Trust over a specific period of time.  The stock trading plan is part of a long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity and was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and AeroVironment's policies with respect to employee stock transactions.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can diversify their investment portfolios, can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about whether they had material, non-public information when they sold their stock.
 
Under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, the Trust may sell up to 280,000 shares over a period of approximately nine months. If the Trust completes all the planned sales under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Conver would beneficially own approximately 4,189,141 shares of AeroVironment common stock (including all options currently exercisable by Mr. Conver), or approximately 19.35% of the company's current outstanding shares. The transactions under this plan will commence no earlier than January 2010 and will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Form 4 filings will also be posted on AeroVironment's website.

AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2010 Second Quarter Results
MONROVIA, CA, December 8, 2009  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended October 31, 2009.
The initiation of digital Raven deliveries at the end of our second quarter marked a milestone for our business and our customers, said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer. Digital Raven systems provide more capability to support and protect ground forces, including those operating in difficult environments such as Afghanistan. We are confident in our ability to meet the strong customer demand for these systems during the second half of our fiscal 2010 and beyond, and reiterate our guidance of 18% to 22% full year revenue growth over last year. The production of digital Raven systems, combined with the progress we made on Switchblade and Global Observer, and the increased interest we saw in electric vehicle infrastructure, position us well for near term execution and multiple, potentially significant long term growth opportunities.
 
Second Quarter Summary:
 
 
 
FISCAL 2010 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $51.4 million, down 22% from second quarter fiscal 2009 revenue of $65.8 million.

Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $3.4 million, down 72% from second quarter fiscal 2009 income from operations of $12.2 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, Calif., March 5, 2010
 (AV) (NASDAQ:AVAV) today appointed Tom Herring as senior vice president and general manager of AV's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) business segment and John Grabowsky as AV's first chief technology officer, a role that will span the company's UAS and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) business segments. Grabowsky previously served as executive vice president and general manager of UAS.
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
"John's contributions to AV have been numerous and significant and as AV's first chief technology officer he will apply his deep technical background across both our business segments, which will enhance AV's leadership and benefit all our customers," said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer.  Conver added that, since joining AV in 2003, Grabowsky has been instrumental in establishing AV as a global leader in unmanned aircraft systems, and the leader in small UAS.
 
"I am also delighted to promote Tom Herring from vice president of UAS business development to the UAS leadership role.  Tom brings a wealth of experience, managerial skills and energy to our team as we address an exciting future in our industry," Conver said.
 
"I cannot think of a more qualified individual to lead the UAS segment than Tom," said Grabowsky.  "Since joining AV in November 2008, Tom has demonstrated creativity, tenacity and effectiveness within the UAS group, helping to strengthen our competitive position and strategic focus.  AV and our customers will benefit from Tom's leadership."
 
Prior to joining AV, Herring held multiple leadership positions during his 27-year tenure with BAE Systems.  Most recently, he served as vice president and general manager of
 
 
Integrated Solutions, a $150M BAE Systems business unit providing solutions for commercial and general aviation aircraft, attack rotorcraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, precision munitions, international military aircraft and ground systems.  He also served as vice president of National Upgrade Programs, vice president of Display Systems and director of programs for the Display Systems product line. Tom also served in program management positions on the B-2, E-2C, E-3A and other major programs.
 
AV is the sole supplier to all U.S. Department of Defense programs of record for small UAS and has delivered more than 13,000 new and replacement air vehicles to customers in the United States and elsewhere.  The family of small hand-launched UAS the company produces and
supports
includes Raven, Wasp and Puma,
each of which transmits live streaming video from their day and night sensors directly to a hand-held common ground controller.  These backpackable sensor platforms provide day and night, real-time video imagery for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition in support of tactical units for missions such as route reconnaissance, base security, mission planning and force protection.
 
Switchblade is a small UAS under development that becomes a highly accurate lethal munition designed for minimal collateral damage.  AV is also a pioneer in developing high altitude long endurance UAS.  The Global Observer is a stratospheric UAS designed to provide affordable persistence without latitude restrictions for remote sensing and communications relay operations. AV's UAS logistics operation supports systems deployed worldwide to ensure a consistently high level of operational readiness. International customers include Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain.

MONROVIA, CA, March 9, 2010  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended January 30, 2010.
 
In the third quarter, our team increased production of digital Raven systems and digital retrofit kits to satisfy customer demand, and made progress positioning our major development programs for eventual adoption, said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer. The quarter produced 18% sequential growth over the second quarter, even though severe weather conditions limited acceptance testing of many Raven systems and the sales those systems would have generated. Continued weakness in the capital equipment markets for our EES products and delays in orders for Puma and Wasp unmanned aircraft systems also adversely impacted the quarter.
 
The Raven systems that were not shipped in the third quarter have already been shipped in the fourth quarter, contributing to what we expect to be record quarterly revenue for the company. However, because of the late signing of the 2010 Defense budget and extended government order processing time, most of the digital Raven purchase orders we expected to receive are still in the procurement process, and they are not likely to arrive in time to convert into fourth quarter revenue. We expect the delayed Raven orders to move into our fiscal 2011, providing us with a strong foundation for achieving growth next year. Our fundamental market position, customer relationships and long-term growth prospects remain strong, yet I acknowledge the impact of order timing on our short-term results, Conver added.
 
Third Quarter Summary:
 
 
 
FISCAL 2010 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $60.9 million, up 17% from third quarter fiscal 2009 revenue of $52.2 million. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $11.7 million, partially offset by lower sales from our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $3.1 million.
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $8.5 million, up 107% from third quarter fiscal 2009 income from operations of $4.1 million. The increase in income from operations was primarily due to higher gross margin of $6.8 million, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $1.9 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.5 million.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $6.5 million, up 43% from third quarter fiscal 2009 net income of $4.5 million.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $0.30, up 43% from third quarter fiscal 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.21.

FISCAL 2010 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $150.2 million, down 12% from the first nine months of fiscal 2009 revenue of $171.6 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from lower sales in our UAS segment of $13.8 million and EES segment of $7.6 million.
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $6.4 million, down 73% from the first nine months of fiscal 2009 income from operations of $23.6 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by lower gross margin of $8.4 million, higher SG&A expense of $6.9 million and higher R&D expense of $1.8 million.
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $5.1 million, down 72% from the first nine months of fiscal 2009 net income of $18.4 million.
Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $0.23, down 73% from the first nine months of fiscal 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.84.

FISCAL 2010  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
estimates.
For fiscal year 2010, the Company expects revenue of approximately $245 million plus or minus $5 million, and operating income margin of 9% to 11%. The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect managements view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, CA, June 24, 2010  AeroVironment, Inc.
(AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending April 30, 2010.
 
"In the fourth quarter we produced record revenue and profitability while transitioning to full rate production of digital small unmanned aircraft systems.  This strong performance enabled us to achieve our revised revenue guidance for fiscal 2010 and exceed our revised operating income guidance," said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer.  "During the year we made great progress on development programs such as Global Observer, Switchblade and EV Solutions.  As a result, we see fiscal 2011 as a year of transition that will lay the foundation for significant long-term growth."
 
 
FISCAL 2010 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $99.4 million, up 31% over fourth quarter fiscal 2009 revenue of $76.0 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $26.7 million offset by decreased sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $3.3 million.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $23.5 million, up 161% from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 income from operations of $9.0 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $16.6 million offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $1.3 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.9 million.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $15.6 million, up 167% from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 net income of $5.8 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $0.71, up from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.27.
 
FISCAL 2010 FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
Revenue for fiscal year 2010 was $249.5 million, up 1% over fiscal year 2009 revenue of $247.7 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $12.8 million offset by decreased sales in our EES segment of $11.0 million.
 
Income from operations for fiscal year 2010 was $29.9 million, down 8% from fiscal year 2009 income from operations of $32.6 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher SG&A expense of $8.2 million and higher R&D expense of $2.7 million, offset by increased gross margin of $8.2 million.
 
Net income for fiscal year 2010 was $20.7 million, down 15% from fiscal year 2009 net income of $24.2 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2010 was $0.94, down 15% from fiscal 2009 earnings per diluted share of $1.11.
BACKLOG
 
As of April 30, 2010, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $72.3 million compared to $114.8 million as of April 30, 2009.
 
FISCAL 2011  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2011, the Company expects to achieve revenue growth of 10% to 15% over fiscal year 2010, with an operating income margin between 12% and 14%.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Adoption of Long-Term Compensation Program.
 
On July 22, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of AeroVironment, Inc. (the "Company") approved a long-term compensation program and initial awards under such program to the executive officers of the Company.  The program is intended to reward the achievement of specific financial objectives over a three-year performance cycle.  Under this program, certain employees, including the Company's executive officers, are eligible to receive an award at the end of the three-year performance period based on the achievement of the financial objectives.  The awards under the program will be granted under the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan") and are intended to be qualified performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
For each performance period under the program, the Compensation Committee will determine a goal bonus amount for each participant receiving an award and financial objectives.  A minimum achievement level of 80% relative to each financial objective must be met in order for any award to be paid.  A participant's final award amount will be determined based on the highest performance relative to any of the financial goals and will be determined based on a sliding scale between achievement levels as follows:
 
 
In no event will a participant receive more than 200% of his or her goal bonus amount.  The Compensation Committee is authorized, in its sole discretion, to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) a participant's final award value based on such external factors (whether objective or subjective) as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.  Each participant's goal bonus amount assumes that he or she will be employed on a full-time basis throughout the performance period.  A participant's goal bonus amount will be prorated to the extent such participant is working on a part-time basis for any portion of the performance period.
 
Following the completion of a three-year performance period, the Compensation Committee will certify the Company's and the relevant business unit's performance relative to the financial objectives for such performance period.  Based on performance relative to the financial objectives, each participant will receive his or her final award.  The awards will be paid as follows:  50% will be paid in cash as soon as practicable following the Compensation Committee's certification of performance relative to the applicable financial objectives (the "Certification Date").  The remaining 50% will be paid in the form of a number of restricted stock units equal to (1) the portion of the award to be paid in the form of restricted stock units divided by (2) the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock on the Certification Date.  The restricted stock units will vest in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversaries of the Certification Date.  The restricted stock units may be settled in cash or in shares of Company common stock, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.  In the event a participant's employment terminates before the end of a performance period or prior to the payment and/or vesting of the cash portion of the award or the restricted stock units, the award and the restricted stock units will be forfeited.
 
The program is intended to be an ongoing program under which the Compensation Committee will grant new long-term compensation awards each year.  However, the Compensation Committee is not obligated to grant awards under the program each year, and it may grant awards in any given year with terms that vary from those set forth above in any respect, including, among other things, the performance objectives, the aggregate award values and the performance period.  All determinations, interpretations and assumptions relating to the vesting and the calculation of the awards under the program will be made by the Compensation Committee.
 
The description of the long-term compensation awards under the 2006 Plan contained in this Item 5.02 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006 Plan and the form of award agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Awards Under the Program for the FY2011-FY2013 Performance Period.
  Also on July 22, 2010, the Compensation Committee granted awards under the long-term compensation program for the initial three-year performance period, which will run from the beginning of the Company's 2011 fiscal year through the end of the Company's 2013 fiscal year (the "FY2011-FY2013 Performance Period") and established the revenue and operating profits objectives, reflecting aggressive compounded growth targets, for such FY2011-FY2013 Performance Period.
 
Set forth below is a list of the executive officers who were granted long-term compensation awards under the program for the FY2011-FY2013 Performance Period and the goal bonus amount of each such award.  The terms of these awards are consistent with the terms of the program described above.   Each award will be evidenced by an award agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
 
 
Awards Under the Program for the FY2011-FY2012 Performance Period. 
Also on July 22, 2010, the Compensation Committee granted awards under the long-term compensation program for a special, transitional two-year performance period, which will run from the beginning of the Company's 2011 fiscal year through the end of the Company's 2012 fiscal year (the "FY2011-FY2012 Performance Period"), and established revenue and operating profits objectives, reflecting aggressive compounded growth targets, for such FY2011-FY2012 Performance Period.  These transitional awards are intended to be a one-time event and the terms of such awards will be identical to the terms of the program described above, except that the final awards will be determined at the end of the two-year performance period and will be paid on the schedule described above starting from such date.
 
The Compensation Committee granted awards for the FY2011-FY2012 Performance Period to the same executive officers, with the same Goal Bonus Amounts as listed above for the FY2011-FY2013 Performance Period.  The terms of these awards are consistent with the terms of the program described above.   Each award will be evidenced by an award agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

Participant's Goal Bonus Amount shall be proportionately adjusted by the Committee in the event that Participant is classified as working less than 40 hours per week during any portion of the Performance Period.
Exhibit B
 
(b)
          
The Final Award Amount, if any, will be a percentage of Participant's Goal Bonus Amount determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and to the Grant Notice.
Exhibit B
 
(c)
          
Participant's right and interest in the Award represents a mere unfunded and unsecured contingent promise to pay by the Company.  This Award is intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" satisfying the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.162-27(e)(2) through (e)(5) and this Agreement shall be interpreted where necessary consistent with such intent.

Payment of Award
.  In the event that (i) Participant remains an Employee until the Certification Date, and (ii) during the Performance Period, the Company achieves the Threshhold Objective (as such term is defined in to the Grant Notice), then the Final Award Amount shall become payable as follows: (i) 50% of the Final Award Amount shall be paid to Participant in cash in a lump sum within 30 days following the Certification Date; and (ii) on the Certification Date, Participant shall be granted such number of Restricted Stock Units ("") as is determined by dividing (x) 50% of the Final Award Amount by (y) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on April 30, 2013.  50% of the RSUs shall vest on April 30, 2014, and 50% of the RSUs shall vest on April 30, 2015, in each case subject to Participant's continued service as an Employee on each such vesting date. Unless and until the RSUs have vested in accordance with the foregoing vesting schedule, Participant will have no right to any distribution with respect to such RSUs.  In the event of Participant's termination of employment prior to the vesting of all of the RSUs, any unvested RSUs will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company.  Participant shall not be deemed to have a termination of employment merely because of a change in the entity for which Participant renders such service, unless following such change in capacity or service Participant is no longer serving as an Employee of the Company or any Subsidiary.

Subject to Section 2.3(c) below, shares of Stock shall be distributed to Participant with respect to such Participant's vested RSUs following the vesting date of the RSUs as specified in Section 2.2, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.  All distributions shall be made by the Company in the form of whole shares of Stock.
 
(b)
          
Any shares of Stock issued under the RSUs shall be issued to Participant, at the sole discretion of the Committee, in either (i) uncertificated form, with the shares recorded in the name of Participant in the books and records of the Company's transfer agent with appropriate notations regarding the restrictions on transfer imposed pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) certificate form.
 
(c)
          
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to settle any vested RSUs in cash.  The cash amount to be paid by the Company upon distribution of any vested RSUs shall be equal to (i) the number of vested RSUs with respect to which Participant is entitled to a distribution multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock on the applicable vesting date.  Such amount shall be paid by the Company on the applicable vesting date.
 
(d)
          
Except as described in this Section 2.3(c), neither the time nor form of distribution of Stock with respect to the RSUs may be changed, except as may be permitted by the Committee in accordance with the Plan and Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
2.4
          
Tax Withholding
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
 
(a)
          
The Company has the authority to deduct or withhold, or require Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including any FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising pursuant to this Agreement.  The Company may permit Participant to make such payment in one or more of the forms specified below:
 
(i)
           
by cash or check made payable to the Company;
 
(ii)
          
by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant;
 
(iii)
         
with respect to any withholding taxes arising as a result of the vesting or settlement of the RSUs, by requesting that the Company withhold a net number of vested shares of Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the RSUs having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries based on the minimum applicable statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes;
 
(iv)
         
with respect to any withholding taxes arising as a result of the vesting or settlement of the RSUs, by tendering vested shares of Stock having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries based on the minimum applicable statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes; or
 
(v)
          
in any combination of the foregoing.
 
(b)
          
With respect to any withholding taxes arising as a result of the vesting or settlement of the RSUs, in the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required pursuant to Section 2.4(a), the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to satisfy all or any portion of Participant's required payment obligation pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(ii) or Section 2.4(a)(iii) above, or any combination of the foregoing as the Company may determine to be appropriate. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any certificate representing shares of Stock issuable with respect to the RSUs to Participant or his or her legal representative unless and until Participant or his or her legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state, local and foreign taxes applicable with respect to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the vesting or settlement of the this Award or any other taxable event related to the RSUs.
 
(c)
          
In the event Participant's tax withholding obligation will be satisfied under
Section 2.4(a)(iii) above, then the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant upon settlement of the RSUs as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy Participant's tax withholding obligation.  Participant's acceptance of this Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described above, including the transactions described in the previous sentence, as applicable.  Any shares of Stock to be sold at the Company's direction through a broker-assisted sale will be sold on the day the tax withholding obligation arises (i.e., the date Stock is delivered) or as soon thereafter as practicable.  The shares of Stock may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the Plan in which all participants receive an average price.  Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's tax withholding obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant as soon as practicable. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's tax withholding obligation.  The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Stock in settlement of the RSUs to Participant until the foregoing tax withholding obligations are satisfied.
 
2.5

(b)

(c)

.

Exhibit 99.1
MONROVIA, CA, September 8, 2010  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended July 31, 2010.
 
"We delivered the financial performance we expected for the first quarter, and we made good progress toward achieving full-year revenue guidance," said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer.  "Shortly after the quarter ended we successfully initiated Global Observer's flight test program and also received a significant order for digital Puma systems, reinforcing our optimism for the long-term viability of these solutions.  We are also gaining greater visibility into the multiple, significant market opportunities that lie ahead of us for both unmanned aircraft systems and electric vehicle solutions, and are increasing near-term investments in research and development to increase AV's market leadership and realize our long-term growth potential."
 
FISCAL 2011 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $38.2 million, up 1% over first quarter fiscal 2010 revenue of $37.9 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $0.1 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $0.2 million.
 
Loss from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $7.3 million, up 34% from first quarter fiscal 2010 loss from operations of $5.5 million. The increase in loss from operations resulted from higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.9 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $2.3 million offset by higher gross margin of $1.3 million.
 
Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $3.4 million, down 4% from first quarter fiscal 2010 net loss of $3.6 million.
 
Loss per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $0.16, down from first quarter fiscal 2010 loss per share of $0.17.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of July 31, 2010, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $63.6 million compared to $72.3 million as of April 30, 2010.  On August 19, 2010 and August 23, 2010, the Company received contract delivery orders valued at $35.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for digital Puma All Environment unmanned aircraft systems and additional support services and equipment.  As these orders were received subsequent to July 31, 2010, they are not included in funded backlog as of July 31, 2010.
 
FISCAL 2011  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2011, the Company reiterates its expectation for revenue growth of 10% to 15% over fiscal year 2010, and reduces its operating income margin expectation to between 10% and 12% of revenue.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, CA, December 7, 2010  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended October 30, 2010.
 
"Strong execution produced second quarter performance that exceeded our forecast, keeping us on track for our fiscal year 2011 plan. Key development programs also hit important milestones in the quarter that move them closer to market adoption," said Tim Conver, AV chairman and chief executive officer.  "We received significant orders for digital Puma small unmanned aircraft systems and made deliveries earlier than expected. We also began the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, demonstrating progress in two key growth areas for fiscal 2011.  Additionally, we made great progress on the Global Observer Joint Capability Technology Demonstration program with the successful completion of initial flight testing.  I believe that we are well on our way to achieving our annual performance targets and positioning AV for long-term growth."
 
FISCAL 2011 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $63.8 million, up 24% from second quarter fiscal 2010 revenue of $51.4 million. The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $9.9 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.5 million.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $0.4 million, down 88% from second quarter fiscal 2010 income from operations of $3.4 million. The decrease in income from operations was caused by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.2 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $2.9 million, partially offset by higher gross margin of $2.1 million.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $0.3 million, down 88% from second quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $2.2 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2011was $0.01, down 90% from second quarter fiscal 2010 earnings per diluted share of $0.10.
 
FISCAL 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $102.0 million, up 14% from the first six months of fiscal 2010 revenue of $89.3 million. The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales in our UAS segment of $10.1 million and EES segment of $2.6 million.
 
Loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $6.9 million, up 232% from the first six months of fiscal 2010 loss from operations of $2.1 million. The increase in loss from operations was caused by higher SG&A expense of $3.1 million and higher R&D expense of $5.2 million, partially offset by higher gross margin of $3.4 million.
 
Net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $3.2 million, up 132% from the first six months of fiscal 2010 net loss of $1.4 million.

FISCAL 2011  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2011, the Company reaffirms its expectation to achieve revenue growth of 10% to 15% over fiscal year 2010, with an operating income margin between 10% and 12%.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

MONROVIA, Calif., January 27, 2011
 AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today announced that its chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Timothy E. Conver, as Trustee of The Conver Family Trust, has established a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a portion of company stock held by the Trust over a specific period of time.  The stock trading plan is part of a long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity and was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and AeroVironment's policies with respect to employee stock transactions.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can diversify their investment portfolios, can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about whether they had material, non-public information when they sold their stock.
 
Under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, the Trust may sell up to 300,000 shares over a period of approximately nine months. If the Trust completes all the planned sales under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Conver would beneficially own approximately  3,905,087 shares of AeroVironment common stock (including all options currently exercisable by Mr. Conver), or approximately 18.45% of the company's current outstanding shares. The transactions under this plan will commence no earlier than March 15, 2011 and will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Form 4 filings will also be posted on AeroVironment's website.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, CA, March 8, 2011  AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended January 29, 2011.
 
"Third quarter year-over-year revenue increased 39% and operating profit increased 85%. Strong third quarter financial performance and sufficient backlog keep us on track to achieve our fiscal 2011 revenue growth and profitability goals," said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer. "In the initial quarter of our electric vehicle charging system rollout, we installed more than 1,000 charging docks for residential and businesscustomers in more than 340 communities across 18states. Revenue and overall demand for small UAS, PosiCharge and EV test systems remain strong. We also continued to execute well on key development program milestones that are important to our customers. I believe we remain well-positioned for long-term growth."
 
FISCAL 2011 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $84.4 million, up 39% from third quarter fiscal 2010 revenue of $60.9 million.

Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $15.7 million, up 85% from third quarter fiscal 2010 income from operations of $8.5 million. The increase in income from operations was primarily due to a higher gross margin of $10.6 million, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.7 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $2.7 million.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $11.5 million, up 76% from third quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $6.5 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2011was $0.52, up 73% from third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings per diluted share of $0.30.
 
FISCAL 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $186.4 million, up 24% from the first nine months of fiscal 2010 revenue of $150.2 million. The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales in our UAS segment of $26.7 million and EES segment of $9.6 million.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $8.8 million, up 37% from the first nine months of fiscal 2010 income from operations of $6.4 million. The increase in income from operations was caused by a higher gross margin of $14.1 million, partially offset by higher SG&A expense of $3.8 million and higher R&D expense of $7.9 million.
 
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $8.3 million, up 61% from the first nine months of fiscal 2010 net income of $5.1 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $0.38, up 65% from the first nine months of fiscal 2010 earnings per share of $0.23.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of January 29, 2011, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $103.8 million compared to $72.3 million as of April 30, 2010.
 
FISCAL 2011  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2011, the Company now expects to achieve revenue growth of 12.5% to 15% over fiscal year 2010, which is the upper half of its prior guidance range, and reiterates its guidance for an operating income margin between 10% and 12% of revenue.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, CA, September 7, 2011  AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its first quarter ending July 30, 2011.
 
"First quarter revenue of $62.0 million rose by 62% over last year, and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 increased from a loss of $0.16.  Reflecting continued demand for our small unmanned aircraft systems, the $65.5 million contract for Puma systems we announced in August provides us with more visibility into full year revenue than at the same point in previous years" said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "Similar demand in our efficient energy systems segment drove shipments and the capture of new contracts across all product lines."
 
Conver added, "I believe our UAS products and services offering will be increasingly relevant to our customers in the Department of Defense funding-constrained environment we are likely to face in the future, and our EV Solutions will help support the broad adoption and practical use of electric vehicles.  By anticipating market requirements with innovative, high-value solutions that do more for much less, and by supporting our customers as they adopt these solutions, we continue to help customers win while growing our business."
 
FISCAL 2012 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $62.0 million, up 62% over first quarter fiscal 2011 revenue of $38.2 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $18.8 million and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $5.0 million.
 
Income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $0.4 million, an increase of $7.7 million from first quarter fiscal 2011 loss from operations of $7.3 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $9.7 million and lower research and development (R&D) expense of $0.4 million, offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.3 million.
 
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $0.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million from first quarter fiscal 2011 net loss of $3.4 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.01, an increase of $0.17 from first quarter fiscal 2011 loss per diluted share of $0.16.

FISCAL 2012  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2012, the Company reiterates its revenue guidance of $321 million to $336 million, and earnings per share of $1.28 to $1.35 on a fully diluted basis.

Applicability

Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing whether and the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. In determining the amount earned by a Covered Employee under such Awards, the Committee shall have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period.

Payment of Performance-Based Awards

If the Participant is married and resides in a community property state, a designation of a person other than the Participant's spouse as his or her beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Participant's interest in the Award shall not be effective without the prior written consent of the Participant's spouse. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution.

The adjustments provided under this Section 11(b)(i) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Participant and the Company.
 
(ii)

(c)

Exhibit 99.1
MONROVIA, Calif., Dec. 6, 2011
 AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ending October 29, 2011.
 
"Continued demand for our unmanned aircraft and efficient energy systems, combined with effective execution by our team, produced second quarter revenue of $80.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 26%, and earnings per diluted share of $0.30, up from $0.01 a year ago," said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "Backlog of $116.4 million is up 60% quarter-over-quarter and, combined with first half revenue of $142 million, provides good visibility into 75% of our full year performance guidance," said Tim Conver.
 
Conver added, "Our small unmanned aircraft systems remain high value tools that directly empower the warfighter at a fraction of the cost of larger systems.  Continued expansion of our electric vehicle solutions rollout and the first announced deployment order for Switchblade agile munitions systems in September highlight the continued progress of two potentially significant long-term growth drivers for the business.  Even with the funding uncertainty affecting U.S. government procurement today, I am excited about AeroVironment's value proposition and our long-term growth prospects."
 
FISCAL 2012 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $80.4 million, up 26% over second quarter fiscal 2011 revenue of $63.8 million.

Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $9.6 million, an increase of $9.2 million from second quarter fiscal 2011 income from operations of $0.4 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $8.9 million and lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.4 million, offset by higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.1 million.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $6.6 million, an increase of $6.3 million from second quarter fiscal 2011 net income of $0.3 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.30, an increase of $0.29 from second quarter fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share of $0.01.
 
FISCAL 2012 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $142.4 million, up 40% from the first six months of fiscal 2011 revenue of $102.0 million. The increase in revenue resulted from higher sales in our UAS segment of $32.1 million and in our EES segment of $8.3 million.
 
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $10.0 million, an increase of $16.9 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011 loss from operations of $6.9 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $18.5 million and lower R&D expense of $0.3 million, offset by higher SG&A expense of $1.9 million.
 
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $6.9 million, an increase of $10.1 million from the first six months of fiscal 2011 net loss of $3.2 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2012 were $0.31, an increase of $0.46 from the first six months of fiscal 2011 loss per share of $0.15.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of October 29, 2011, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $116.4 million compared to $82.9 million as of April 30, 2011.
 
FISCAL 2012  OUTLOOK FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company expects revenue of $80 to $90 million, and earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.45 on a fully diluted basis.
 
For fiscal year 2012, the Company reiterates its revenue guidance of $321 million to $336 million, and earnings per share of $1.28 to $1.35 on a fully diluted basis.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MONROVIA, Calif., Jan. 11, 2012
 AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) today announced that Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Timothy E. Conver, as Trustee of The Conver Family Trust, has established a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a portion of company stock held by the Trust over a specific period of time.  The stock trading plan is part of a long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity and was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and AeroVironment's policies with respect to employee stock transactions.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can diversify their investment portfolios, can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about whether they had material, non-public information when they sold their stock.
 
Under its Rule 10b5-1 plan, the Trust may sell up to 650,000 shares over a period of approximately 11 months. If the Trust completes all the planned sales under its Rule 10b5-1 plan, Conver would beneficially own approximately 2,486,292 shares of AeroVironment common stock (including all options currently exercisable by Conver, but not including shares held by The Whiting Family Limited Partnership, of which Conver is a limited partner), or approximately 11.9% of the company's current outstanding shares. The transactions under this plan will commence no earlier than March 2012 and will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and
 
 
 
Exchange Commission. The Form 4 filings also will be posted on the "Investors" section of the AeroVironment website.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
MONROVIA, Calif., Mar. 6, 2012
 AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its third quarter ending January 28, 2012.
 
"As of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 our revenue is up 15% and diluted earnings per share have grown by 50% compared to the same point last fiscal year." said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "Q3 performance would have been much higher but an administrative delay in customer acceptance pushed the delivery of about $20 million in Raven and Puma systems completed in Q3 into the first week of the fourth quarter. This resulted in third quarter revenue of $72 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, which were lower than planned but do not affect our outlook for the full fiscal year.  Small UAS products and services, electric vehicle test and EV charging systems continue to demonstrate solid performance, Switchblade continues to gain traction with customers and our development programs continue to advance toward future adoption, supporting AeroVironment's long-term growth objectives."
 
FISCAL 2012 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $72.0 million, down 15% over third quarter fiscal 2011 revenue of $84.4 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from decreased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $14.5 million partially offset by increased sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $2.0 million.
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $7.3 million, a decrease of $8.4 million from third quarter fiscal 2011 income from operations of $15.7 million. The decrease in income from operations resulted from lower gross margin of $6.7 million and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.3 million offset by lower research and development (R&D) expense of $0.6 million.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $5.7 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from third quarter fiscal 2011 net income of $11.5 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.26, a decrease of $0.26 from third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share of $0.52.
 
FISCAL 2012 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $214.3 million, up 15% from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 revenue of $186.4 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $17.6 million and EES segment of $10.3 million.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $17.3 million, an increase of $8.5 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 income from operations of $8.8 million. The increase in income from operations was caused by higher gross margin of $11.8 million and lower R&D expense of $0.9 million, partially offset by higher SG&A expense of $4.2 million.
 
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $12.7 million, an increase of $4.4 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 net income of $8.3 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were $0.57, an increase of $0.19 from the first nine months of fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share of $0.38.
BACKLOG
 
As of January 28, 2012, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $85.5 million compared to $82.9 million as of April 30, 2011.
 
FISCAL 2012  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2012, the Company reiterates its revenue guidance of $321 million to $336 million, and earnings per share of $1.28 to $1.35 on a fully diluted basis.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
MONROVIA, Calif., June 26, 2012
 (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending April 30, 2012.
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
"Record fourth quarter revenue of $111 million and earnings per share of $0.80 produced another year of profitable growth.  Revenue in 2012 was $325 million, and fully diluted earnings per share this year of $1.36 represents compound annual growth of more than 20 percent since 2010," said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "Our team's effective execution continued to help our customers win and delivered annual growth of 11 percent in revenue, 16 percent in earnings per share and 12 percent in funded backlog.  We also further enhanced our long-term growth prospects with important new capabilities in our unmanned aircraft systems and efficient energy systems business segments, benefiting our customers and our stakeholders."
 
FISCAL 2012 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $110.7 million, up 4% over fourth quarter fiscal 2011 revenue of $106.1 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $6.4 million offset by decreased sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $1.8 million.
 
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $25.7 million, an increase of $0.5 million from fourth quarter fiscal 2011 income from operations of $25.2 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $0.3 million and lower research and development (R&D) expense of $3.9 million offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $3.7 million.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $17.8 million, an increase of $0.2 million from fourth quarter fiscal 2011 net income of $17.6 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.80, an increase of $0.01 from fourth quarter fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share of $0.79.
 
FISCAL 2012 FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
Revenue for fiscal 2012 was $325.0 million, up 11% from fiscal 2011 revenue of $292.5 million. The increase in revenue resulted from increased sales in our UAS segment of $24.0 million and EES segment of $8.5 million.
 
Income from operations for fiscal 2012 was $43.1 million, an increase of $9.1 million from fiscal 2011 income from operations of $34.0 million. The increase in income from operations was caused by higher gross margin of $12.2 million and lower R&D expense of $4.8 million offset by higher SG&A expense of $7.9 million.
 
Net income for fiscal 2012 was $30.5 million, an increase of $4.6 million from fiscal 2011 net income of $25.9 million.
Earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2012 were $1.36, an increase of $0.19 from fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share of $1.17.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of April 30, 2012, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $93.2 million compared to $82.9 million as of April 30, 2011.
 
FISCAL 2013  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2013, the Company expects to generate revenue of $348 million to $370 million, and earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.51 on a fully diluted basis.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MONROVIA, Calif., September 5, 2012
 (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its first quarter ending July 28, 2012.
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
"Fiscal 2013 is unfolding consistent with our range of expectations for the year.  We anticipated a typically low revenue first quarter would produce a net loss because we are staffed and investing to achieve the growth we expect in the second half of this year and beyond," said AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer Tim Conver.  "First quarter revenue of $58.7 million was about $3 million less than we expected, attributable to contract timing, and produced a loss per share of $0.06.  Our funded backlog increased 6% during the quarter and as of now we have visibility into almost 70% of our expected full year revenue, a good indicator of full year performance in a volatile business environment."
 
"We are focusing bid and proposal and research and development investments on multiple adjacent market and new development initiatives where we continue to receive positive customer feedback on the probability of successfully capturing long-term growth opportunities.  At the same time, we are managing other costs in the business to achieve our financial plan for the fiscal year," Conver added.
 
FISCAL 2013 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $58.7 million, down 5% from first quarter fiscal 2012 revenue of $62.0 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from decreased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $3.4 million offset by increased sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $0.1 million.
 
Loss from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $2.3 million, as compared to income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of $0.4 million. The loss from operations resulted from lower gross margin of $2.2 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $0.6 million offset by lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.1 million.
 
Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $1.4 million, as compared to net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of $0.3 million.
 
Loss per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $0.06, as compared to earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of $0.01.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of July 28, 2012, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $98.4 million compared to $93.2 million as of April 30, 2012.
FISCAL 2013  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2013, the Company expects to generate revenue of $348 million to $370 million, and earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.51 on a fully diluted basis.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MONROVIA, Calif.
,  (NASDAQ: AVAV) today announced that its chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Timothy E. Conver, as Trustee of The Conver Family Trust, has established a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a portion of company stock held by the Trust over a specific period of time.  The stock trading plan is part of a long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity and was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and AeroVironment's policies with respect to employee stock transactions.
October 17, 2012
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can diversify their investment portfolios, can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about whether they had material, non-public information when they sold their stock.
 
Under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, the Trust may sell up to 700,000 shares over a period of approximately nine months. If the Trust completes all the planned sales under its Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Conver would beneficially own approximately 2,451,822 shares of AeroVironment common stock (including all options currently exercisable by Mr. Conver), or approximately 11.39% of the company's current outstanding shares. The transactions under this plan will commence no earlier than December 2012 and will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Form 4 filings will also be posted on AeroVironment's website.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MONROVIA, Calif., Dec. 4, 2012
 (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ending October 27, 2012.
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
"Strong second quarter performance, including a 30 percent increase in year-over-year diluted earnings per share to $0.39, resulted from continued demand for our market-leading solutions, favorable product mix and our focus on cost management.  Revenue of $80 million included a majority, but not all of the international small UAS orders that had been working through the export administrative process," said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "Because of contracting delays on key programs, revenue in our second half will be more heavily weighted to our fourth quarter, historically the highest revenue quarter of our year.  Looking beyond fiscal 2013, in addition to executing effectively in our current businesses, our team made significant progress during the quarter on development programs such as Switchblade, Mission Services and larger, vertical takeoff UAS, all of which are poised to drive long-term growth in adjacent and new markets."
 
FISCAL 2013 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $80.3 million, down $0.1 million from second quarter fiscal 2012 revenue of $80.4 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from decreased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $1.5 million offset by increased sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $1.4 million.
 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $13.1 million, an increase of 37% from income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 of $9.6 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $5.0 million, offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $0.9 million and research and development (R&D) expense of $0.6 million.
 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $8.7 million, an increase of $2.1 million from net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 of $6.6 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.39, an increase of $0.09 from second quarter fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share of $0.30.
 
FISCAL 2013 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $139.0 million, down 2% from the first six months of fiscal 2012 revenue of $142.4 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from lower sales in our UAS segment of $4.9 million, offset by increased sales in our EES segment of $1.5 million.
 
Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $10.8 million, an increase of 8% from the first six months of fiscal 2012 income from operations of $10.0 million. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher gross margin of $2.8 million, offset by higher R&D expense of $1.1 million and SG&A expense of $0.9 million.
 
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $7.4 million, an increase of $0.5 million from net income for the first six months of fiscal 2012 of $6.9 million.
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were $0.33, an increase of $0.02 from the first six months of fiscal 2012 income per share of $0.31.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of October 27, 2012, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $90.2 million compared to $93.2 million as of April 30, 2012.
 
FISCAL 2013  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2013, the Company expects to generate revenue of $348 million to $370 million, and earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.51 on a fully diluted basis.
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MONROVIA, Calif., Mar. 5, 2013
 (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its third quarter ending January 26, 2013.
AeroVironment, Inc.
 
"Third quarter revenue of $47.1 million and earnings per share of $0.17 fell well short of our plans primarily due to delays in government procurements expected during the quarter," said Tim Conver, AeroVironment chairman and chief executive officer.  "We believe these are delays in order timing, and not lost orders.  We have recalibrated our expectations for order and shipment timing in our UAS business based on the procurement timelines we are currently experiencing, resulting in a significant reduction in expected revenue and earnings per share for fiscal 2013."
 
"We continue to see multiple opportunities for growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond based on leading market positions and significant new development activities for both defense and non-defense solutions," Conver added.
 
FISCAL 2013 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $47.1 million, down $24.9 million from third quarter fiscal 2012 revenue of $72.0 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from decreased sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $19.6 million and in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $5.3 million.
 
Loss from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $1.1 million, a decrease of 115% from income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 of $7.3 million. The decrease in income from operations resulted from lower gross margin of $7.8 million and higher research and development (R&D) expense of $3.1 million, offset by lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $2.4 million.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $3.9 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 of $5.7 million.
 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.17, a decrease of $0.09 from third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share of $0.26.
 
FISCAL 2013 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
 
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $186.0 million, down 13% from the first nine months of fiscal 2012 revenue of $214.3 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from lower sales in our UAS segment of $24.5 million and EES segment of $3.8 million.
 
Income from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $9.8 million, a decrease of 44% from the first nine months of fiscal 2012 income from operations of $17.3 million. The decrease in income from operations resulted from lower gross margin of $5.0 million and higher R&D expense of $4.2 million, offset by lower SG&A expense of $1.6 million.
 
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $11.2 million, a decrease of $1.4 million from net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 of $12.7 million.
Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 were $0.50, a decrease of $0.07 from the first nine months of fiscal 2012 income per diluted share of $0.57.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of January 26, 2013, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $70.5 million compared to $93.2 million as of April 30, 2012.
 
FISCAL 2013  OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
For fiscal year 2013, the Company is reducing its guidance to reflect anticipated full year revenue of $230 million to $250 million, and earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.50 on a fully diluted basis.
 
"Significant delays in government procurement activities have reduced our expected revenue sharply from our original guidance of $348 million to $370 million.  Multiple orders for our unmanned aircraft systems solutions have been delayed, including a funded requirement of the U.S. government awaiting final contract actions, and the time it takes to complete them has increased considerably, pushing them into fiscal 2014," said Tim Conver.  "Looking forward, we see significant opportunities to achieve long-term compound growth with Switchblade Loitering Munitions systems, mission services and international small UAS sales."
 
The foregoing estimates are forward looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to obtain and retain government contracts, delays or changes in government funding; changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors and changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On May 29, 2013, AeroVironment, Inc. (the "Company") implemented an organizational realignment and workforce reduction.
 
The purpose of the organizational realignment within the Company's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Efficient Energy Systems (EES) business segments is to enhance the Company's focus on new product introductions and the adoption of new solutions designed to support the Company's long-term growth plans.
 
The workforce reduction is in response to continued delays in U.S. government procurements from the Company's UAS business segment and to delays in the growth of plug-in electric vehicle adoption and associated recharging solution sales in the Company's EES business segment.
 
The cost of the organizational realignment and workforce reduction is estimated to be approximately $1.1 million, consisting primarily of severance payments.  The Company expects to record this charge in its fiscal first quarter ending July 27, 2013.

The Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
